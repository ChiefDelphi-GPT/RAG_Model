This will probably be a bit of an essay but I will try to keep each part concise and focus on issues we saw and how we resolved them. Last year’s post is linked above and I will try to avoid duplicating too much of that information here, because most of it is still very relevant.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eBumpers\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eMounting: I saw several setups that made the bumpers very hard to remove for inspection. Remember they have to be able to come off quickly and easily for weight inspection. There are a lot of ways to do this, several of which I highlighted last year. I saw \\u003ca href=\\\"https://docs.wcproducts.com/cone-bumper-mount\\\" rel=\\\"noopener nofollow ugc\\\"\\u003ethese from \\u003cspan class=\\\"abbreviation\\\"\\u003eWCP\\u003ctemplate class=\\\"tooltiptext\\\" data-text=\\\"West Coast Products\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/template\\u003e\\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003c/a\\u003e for the first time this year and they proved to be a nice way to have the bumpers align and bracket in. Cheesycare will likely be picking up a few sets of these for bumper rebuilds.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eCorner Construction: when building pool noodle bumpers, the rules \\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/frc/game-and-season-info/2025-Bumper-Rule-Changes.pdf\\\" rel=\\\"noopener nofollow ugc\\\"\\u003echanged this year\\u003c/a\\u003e to not allow the corner wrap style. We had to rebuild a couple of bumpers this year to have legal noodle layouts.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eNumbers: there are rules about the size and placement of numbers! Also they need to not fall off and the bumpers are usually the first thing to touch other robots, the field, etc so they can get scraped off if not firmly attached. Staples in the middle of the fabric aren’t great so I like a paint pen and stencils for quick, easy, and durable numbers.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eReversible Bumpers: reiterating comments from last year here, they can be done but they are hard to get right and I recommend against them. Oftentimes the fabric will fall down or come loose mid-match which can lead to penalties. See last year’s comments for more specifics.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\n\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eCoral/Algae in robots\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eOther than electrical things, this was probably our most common thing to work with teams on.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eWe knew from day 1 this would be a big issue.

All of the modules have great build instructions and don’t really come with extra pieces. Follow the instructions, don’t skip parts, and keep an eye on maintenance throughout the season. I have noticed a big rise in missing screws, bearings, spacers, etc in modules.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eGreasing your modules is important for longevity of the gears! I had at least two interactions at a single regional this year where there was a comment along the lines of “we are supposed to grease the gears?” Yes, yes you are.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\n\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eCantilevering off of planetary gearboxes\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eMAXPlanetary: these gearboxes are pretty solid, assuming they are built correctly. But they aren’t really robust enough to support a cantilevered arm directly off the output shaft. I recommend putting your arm on a more solid shaft setup and then using chain or belts to connect the gearbox to the arm pivot. Gears can work but tend to shear teeth.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\n\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eSoftware\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eGo straight Autos: With the prevalence of swerve drive and path planning tools, it has become more challenging to quickly add a “go-straight across the line” style autonomous.\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eI am fully in support of all of these tools as it significantly lowers the barrier to entry for complex auto routines\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eIf one of these tools is used, basically removes the ability to “turn the motors on for 1 second at 50% power and drive roughly straight” to cross the line\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eThis is not usually a priority for teams prior to events due to trying to score more points, but when all else breaks on the robot, it is an important stop-gap to ensure you can still achieve the ranking point every match. Make sure you have some option here for when your robot isn’t fully working.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\n\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\n\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eDriver Stations\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eThis isn’t a new issue, it has been present for several years, but sometimes you just need to restart the driver station software or computer entirely. The most common symptoms are the robot not enabling or controllers not showing up. A simple restart often fixes these weird and hard-to-diagnose bugs.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\\"https://github.com/FletcherS7/FRC-Driver-Station-Connectivity-Script\\\" rel=\\\"noopener nofollow ugc\\\"\\u003eDriver Station Connectivity Script\\u003c/a\\u003e: We have occasionally encountered driver station connectivity issues that are beyond my knowledge. I became aware of this script made by \\u003ca class=\\\"mention\\\" href=\\\"/u/fletchers7\\\"\\u003e@FletcherS7\\u003c/a\\u003e at champs when troubleshooting these issues.

A lot of it is the same as last year so I have focused on new or different issues. Everything from my previous post still applies.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cspan class=\\\"abbreviation\\\"\\u003eCAN\\u003ctemplate class=\\\"tooltiptext\\\" data-text=\\\"Controller Area Network\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/template\\u003e\\u003c/span\\u003e Issues:\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eOne particularly challenging-to-debug issue was with the USB-C cable that comes with the CANivore to connect it to the roboRIO. These cables are low quality and it was somewhat common that this was the source of weird and hard to diagnose issues on the \\u003cspan class=\\\"abbreviation\\\"\\u003eCAN\\u003ctemplate class=\\\"tooltiptext\\\" data-text=\\\"Controller Area Network\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/template\\u003e\\u003c/span\\u003e bus. Replacing that cable with a higher quality one as well as adding \\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.amazon.com/20pcs-Clip-Ferrite-Suppressor-Diameter/dp/B0CSXZWGD6\\\" rel=\\\"noopener nofollow ugc\\\"\\u003eclip on ferrites\\u003c/a\\u003e to the cable helped significantly. This is also a key point for hot glue and zip ties to keep this USB cable secured on both ends.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\n\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eElevator/Arm Wiring\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eConstraining the motion of the wires to avoid catching on the rest of the robot or field elements: wires need to be \\u003ca href=\\\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/67MSYPBxg5XUWvd9A\\\" rel=\\\"noopener nofollow ugc\\\"\\u003elong enough to reach the full range of motion\\u003c/a\\u003e of the subsystem, but also not totally unconstrained so that they do not catch on things. On linear systems like \\u003ca href=\\\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/uZTVJKzSAdiJijut9\\\" rel=\\\"noopener nofollow ugc\\\"\\u003eelevators\\u003c/a\\u003e, cable chains (energy chains, e-chains, rolling loops, etc) running in a channel are a good way to do this. These e-chains are not designed to be totally full (my rule of thumb is no more than 60% full but if you want to get into the weeds on it, here is a \\u003ca href=\\\"https://blog.igus.eu/knowledge-base/how-much-clearance-space-should-i-leave-in-the-e-chain/\\\" rel=\\\"noopener nofollow ugc\\\"\\u003emore complete description\\u003c/a\\u003e), needing space to allow the wires to move inside otherwise there will be issues with the chain breaking. Keep in mind that not every cable will move along the neutral axis of the chain, so they must be able to shift relative to each other.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eServiceability: putting appropriate break points on at least one end of the dynamic cabling allows for subsystem removal, maintenance, and debugging. This break point is super helpful but needs to be properly strain relieved so that it doesn’t disconnect mid-match.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eAvoid putting connectors/wagos/etc in the middle of dynamic cabling. Ideally the dynamic cables are single wires with no connections in moving sections.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\n\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eNEOs\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eThe encoder wires coming out of the NEOs are \\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/neo-550-broken-encoder-wire/403425\\\"\\u003esuper fragile\\u003c/a\\u003e. This is a common issue on both full-sized and 550 versions. They are incredibly easy to damage when plugging or unplugging the connector or from getting caught on other things (either in use or during assembly).\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\n\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eKrakens\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eThe screw terminals need to be properly torqued (with the \\u003ca href=\\\"https://store.ctr-electronics.com/products/pre-set-torque-wrench\\\" rel=\\\"noopener nofollow ugc\\\"\\u003edesigned torque spec/wrench\\u003c/a\\u003e) and checked during routine maintenance. Over-torquing can lead to damaging the motor and the screw threads. Under-torquing can lead to loose connections and unreliable performance.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eOn the power terminals, we actually use 1.2Nm instead of the recommended 0.9Nm. We found the 0.9Nm to slowly loosen over time and not be an issue with 1.2Nm. YMMV\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eThe back caps/covers can crush the wires if those wires aren’t positioned quite right. Make sure the wires are routed under the clearances in the cover, rather than crossing where some of the ribs would be.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eIf the power and \\u003cspan class=\\\"abbreviation\\\"\\u003eCAN\\u003ctemplate class=\\\"tooltiptext\\\" data-text=\\\"Controller Area Network\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/template\\u003e\\u003c/span\\u003e ring terminals short to each other, this can lead to \\u003cspan class=\\\"abbreviation\\\"\\u003eCAN\\u003ctemplate class=\\\"tooltiptext\\\" data-text=\\\"Controller Area Network\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/template\\u003e\\u003c/span\\u003e issues. Proper torquing and alignment of the terminals helps prevent this.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\n\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eCompetition Execution: This is a hard topic to discuss as every team approaches it in their own way, but I feel it is important as it is probably the single biggest contributor of competition trajectory. I want to focus this on what I have seen from when teams show up with unfinished/imperfect robots. Please forgive the oversimplification below.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eBefore arriving, set realistic goals for your team. When the competition starts, you have the robot you do, and you are truly out of time. Your focus should shift to getting the most out of the robot you have. These will vary for each team, but what I tell the CheesyCare kids are these:\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eMake sure all teams play at least one practice match (may be less applicable for districts)\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eEvery team should play every match\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eAvoid major functionality changes at events. Focus on making existing subsystems as reliable as possible without adding complexity.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eWhen in doubt, do less. Simple robots with reduced functionality tend to work more consistently than the robot that tries to do everything. At 254’s first event this year, we mechanically removed our ability to score L1 on practice day (and kept it off for the rest of the event) because it wasn’t working, and the robot did better than if we had continued to try to solve it live.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\n\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eI like to be optimistically realistic. Not every robot is going to work every time, but the goal should be maximizing the level of play of the robot that you already have.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eMake existing subsystems work and prioritize match-by-match. Fix the important things first and prioritize: it doesn’t matter that the elevator doesn’t work if the robot cannot drive. It doesn’t make sense to try to add your climbing mechanism while you are having \\u003cspan class=\\\"abbreviation\\\"\\u003eCAN\\u003ctemplate class=\\\"tooltiptext\\\" data-text=\\\"Controller Area Network\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/template\\u003e\\u003c/span\\u003e bus issues that take out the rest of the robot. Focus on being as functional as possible for each and every match. Sometimes the best call is to leave one problem unsolved to focus your pit crew’s energy on a more impactful fix.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eIf you are going to miss a match, make sure you send a representative to the field. Sometimes it doesn’t make sense to go to a match (this is an extreme case and I basically never recommend it) in order to fix something. If you are going to miss the match, make sure a person gets sent to the field so that you can get any alliance points for that match.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eIn a lot of ways, this was a more gentle game in terms of impacts and robot-to-robot interactions than last year’s game. That led to a lot fewer major structural failures and symptoms of robots playing rough-and-tumble. If we see a game next year that encourages more defense/robot contact I think a lot of what I put in last year’s post will come back as prominent issues that we didn’t see as much this year.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThese were my experiences this year, I am curious to see what everyone else saw this
