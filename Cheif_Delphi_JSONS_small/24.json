                    "cooked": "Wow, what a great end to a season. Worlds was amazing, and we had a ton of fun at our regionals and are looking forward to off-seasons. This whole thing started when suddenly our Limelight 3G stopped turning on. We were powering this via PoE, being injected into the VH radio, which was 12V regulated by a VRM. This method worked amazing until it stopped being amazing. We tried powering over the DC jacks on the limelight and suddenly it started working again. We turned off PoE for all of our limelights and powered them over the DC jacks for the rest of the season.\n\nBefore we were going to our first regional we always run over an inspection checklist. We got to the electrical part and tested the ground to the robot frame, where we heard the dreaded beep of our multimeter. We had a short somewhere on the robot. So we started pulling fuses until the beeping stopped. One after another we finally get to the breaker on the PDH for the MPM. The beep stops. Turns out, the limelight 3G that we were running had some sort of internal short to ground. It was only on the frame of the limelight. We electrically isolated the limelight from the rest of the frame by adding a lot of liquid electrical tape and plastic washers. This solved our issue, and hopefully allowed us to pass inspection. I later took apart this limelight to see if I could see anything visually wrong, with no luck, although I don’t really know what to look for except burnt PCB.\n\nWe contacted limelight and got a replacement 3G. It wouldn’t get there in time so we bit the bullet and bought a LL4 with the Hailo upgrade, just because we needed something immediately and we were already looking to upgrade. We went to our regional with the LL4 and the shorted LL3G. No issues at the regional. Eventually we swap out the shorted out limelight (that was still fully functional, aside from the PoE of course). Weirdly though, sometimes when the robot would boot up, we could see that the limelight was working (by the rapid flashing green light on the front saying that it detects a tag) but we couldn’t access it on its web interface. We unplugged the limelight and plugged it back in. Still cant access it. We unplugged the radio and plugged it back in, still cant access it. We finally powered cycle the whole robot (what we should have done at the start) and suddenly its back on? I looked around on CD and found someone saying that they think its because the RIO only gives out IP addresses for a little bit of time, and sometimes the limelight takes too long to boot. That doesn’t really make sense to me, so please if you have any theories let me know!\n\nThis issue kept presenting itself throughout the entire season and the solution was to just power cycle. Then we discover the hailo upgrade can make it easier for the limelight to find apriltags. We turn it on for a match on one of our regionals. It works, so we run it for the next match. Then suddenly our odometry isn’t updating and we cannot line up to score. I look at the limelight feed and its drawing blue circles around the bolts on the apriltags. Weird. We turn it off. I talk to a CSA and he has no idea either. From what I understand, the blue circles are what the neural network “thinks” is an apriltag and it narrows down the image for the limelight to pick out the apriltag, instead of it looking at the whole image. I understand that there can be errors in the model and its not perfect, which is why we just opted to turn off the upgrade.\n\nThen we get to the world championship. We are going through inspection and the RI probes the robot for any shorts. The multimeter is beeping on the LL4 now! We start narrowing this down and eventually find that the short is caused by the ethernet cable somehow. We unplug the ethernet cable and the short goes away. We plug it back in, and the short is back?\n\nLuckily the short was reading 34 kiloohms, which meant we still passed inspection. I’m not an electrical engineer so I have no idea what that means, but if any of you guys have theories please put them below.\n\nI think for next year I am going to push for us to just use photonvision instead with the orange Pis. I’ve had too many issues with the limelights this year and it made me rip my hair out trying to figure out what is going on. I believe we contacted support about all this but I was not the one to contact them, so I do not know what was said.\n\nI made this post to see if any of you all had these same issues and what you did to solve them. I see teams like 118 using 4 of the LL4s on their robot and they don’t seem to be having any issues. Did I just manage to get 2 bad batches of limelights? Is it user error? Thanks.",

Some teams have experienced success by reimagining their Limitlights, while others required a Root Mean Square (RMA) process. The core issue lies in the failure of the Limelight to boot properly and initiate the network stack, which explains the absence of link lights on the VH-109. For further assistance, contacting Limelight support is recommended.",
