We have had a pretty good experience so far, but with the probable discontinuation of Falcons and the added capability of the Kraken motor, we are considering switching to using Krakes as our drive motor. That said, from the information gathered so far, we would need to purchase 3-4 additional Kraken motors and 4 pinion sets for approximately $700-$900. We do have some spare Falcons on hand, so a motor failure isn’t a major concern right now—we’re mostly looking to enhance our drivetrain. Is this upgrade worth the investment? Are there any other components we’d need to acquire? Additionally, what are some other ways we can improve our drivetrain?",

However, overall performance differences might not significantly impact gameplay unless your team excels. Instead of focusing on drivetrain performance, I’d prioritize building a dependable robot and enhancing its speed mechanisms. If you’re encountering reliability issues linked to Falcons, switching could indeed be a more critical step than considering power levels.\n\nThough Kraken robots shouldn’t cause harm (I was satisfied with them this year), you can allocate remaining Falcons to working on mechanisms instead.\n\nBudgeting considerations include purchasing torque wrenches from either CTRE or WCP, as these tools are essential to prevent motor damage from over-torquing terminals.\n\nThe most significant improvement in your drivetrain likely comes from programming and driver practice. Analyzing top-performing teams’ code for swerve drive simplicity could provide valuable insights.\n\nAdditionally, tracking time spent driving versus other tasks—like alignment or placement—could help optimize your approach. For instance, reviewing WildStang Robotics' build blog for practical insights into improving your robot’s efficiency.",

This year, we noticed our drivetrain was relatively slow, and I’m not entirely sure why—it’s my first year participating in the FIRST Robotics Competition. As for the best swerve code among teams, I’d need to look into that further. Additionally, we plan to rebuild our swerve modules for maintenance, addressing several issues we’ve identified during testing.",

Over time, we noticed more problems with the motors. Before isr #4, we upgraded the drive motor to Kraken, seeing only a small improvement in performance. This year, we again used Kraken as the steering motor because our falcon 500s were getting old and we couldn't test other motors like the neo.",

Conversely, in half-field or quarter-field games (2019, 2025), enhanced acceleration and mechanism speed become crucial, suggesting falcon designs with optimized gear ratios may perform better.\n\nAdditionally, you can explore drivetrain configurations on recalc, which will aid in refining your decision-making process.\n\nMoreover, a notable discussion on recalc论坛 highlighted important aspects related to current limitations, indicating that the 3005 design effectively balances performance across various conditions, with many competitors also favoring Neos.",
