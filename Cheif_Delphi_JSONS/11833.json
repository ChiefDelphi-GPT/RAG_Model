It is often best to add a friction brake at on one of the higher speed shafts or lower torque shafts in a gear reduction.  This can be done on a custom parallel shaft gearbox, but would be quite challenging on a stacked planetary.\n\nAdding brake mechanisms.

I would also say that until the MAXPlanetary came out I didn’t feel like we had a reliable option for high-torque motors. I was able to run a 3-stage MP gearbox off a Falcon last year with a final drive chain reduction and never had a failure.\n\nLearning opportunities is obviously a big factor if you have a design team that is ready to take on the challenge of doing custom spur gearboxes it be a valuable experience.\n\nI would also posit weight as a reason…because of the availability of pocketed gears you likely could build a spur gearbox for a given application with the same ratio of a planetary gearbox and it could weigh less.",

Using a planetary gearbox in this scenario would be inefficient because you would need two of them running at their lowest ratio and would likely be heavier and take up more space, it would also cost significantly more, as long as you have the manufacturing capability to make accurate hole patterns.",
