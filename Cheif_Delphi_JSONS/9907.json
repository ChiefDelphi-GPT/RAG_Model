However, I find its dimensions unusual, making it harder for me to work with.\n\nScreen Shot 2023-11-19 at 1.41.25 PM 1920×1243 136 KB Drawing for the bearing block, from Andymark’s website\n\nScreen Shot 2023-11-19 at 1.41.25 PM 1920×1243 136 KB\n\nScreen Shot 2023-11-19 at 1.41.25 PM 1920×1243 136 KB\n\nThe depth of the groove in the center of the bearing block is between 0.139\" and 0.134\", based on Section A-A, and in CAD, it measures 0.138780\". This means the lateral distance between tubes of consecutive stages is supposed to be about 0.1875 in - 0.138780 in + (13 mm/2) which is approximately 0.305 in, with 0.005 unilateral tolerance. Looking at Wildstangs’ 2023 CAD release, they also used the Andymark bearing blocks, and used 0.305\" spacing.\n\nI am confused as to why the bearing blocks were designed with these kinds of measurements, since I feel like it would have been simpler to design it with “nicer” numbers, and it would allow the stages to be fully defined with tangent mates.\n\nFor instance, the depth of the groove could’ve been something like 0.1875\" (looking at the CAD, there would still be a decent amount of clearance for the countersink head) instead of 0.139\". With 0.5\" bearings, there would be 0.25\" spacing between stages, and 0.0625\" clearance between the bearing block and next stage (sufficient for the same tolerance).\n\nThis is just a random idea off the top of my head, but my question is on why the Andymark bearing blocks were designed in such a way. The mixing of metric and imperial units means that the CAD cannot be perfect, but more importantly, such numbers can introduce confusion during machining and assembly, increasing the risk of wasting materials and time.",

As @Skyehawk mentioned, you could have a significant gap and they would still work just fine (with 9mm deep bearings, even 1/8\" on each side would “work”). You could find the closest “normal” imperial number above the 0.305\" x 2 = 0.610\" and go with that, if you wanted to make it easier to cut a tube to length with a tape measure. 0.625\"? 0.75\"?\n\nThe mixing of units seems to come from the particular bearings used. We don’t have insight there, but I would highly suspect sourcing to be a driving factor.\n\nFor the pocket depth, if these are used with at most 1/8\" wall tubes, it makes sense not to pocket much more than that. If I care more about forces in the “primary” direction (vs lateral, as AM defines them in their description here ), then I would want to keep the material in the plane that those 13mm x 9mm bearings attach to as thick as possible.\n\nThey also appear to be the same depth as the nut pockets, which may be a DFM decision (no idea what their setup looks like).",
