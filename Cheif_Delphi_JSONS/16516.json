However, we are meeting now, and as our programming department continues its exploration, the rest of the team is working on finishing the 2020 bot. The team elected to keep using Python for any off-season events we have. When we get closer to the new season, we will make the decision about which langiage we will commit to this season.\n\nI just realized that the version of robotpy on the bot is 2020 not 2021 (I do not remember the specific version number). The same is true for the vendor libraries. We are still able to make changes in code and push it to the robot (using the no version check flag of course).\n\nAnyway, my question is, should we update to 2021 before our next off-season event (we have one next month)? Or, should we be okay to run with 2020 on the bot as long as we are still able to push code and run it from our updated driver station?\n\nI do not want us to figure this out at the event as it will involve updating many pieces of software and firmware (Rio, robotpy, vendor libraries, motor controllers, NavX, and possibly the radio).",

It’s a risk: hopefully everything is just fine, but maybe you will find issues with integration or functionality.\n\nThe way to mitigate the risk is to make the change at a time when you have plenty of ability to test and validate (either formally , or even just getting “soak time” with the software running and watching for issues). If you lack time to test, it’s probably not worth the risk of updating.\n\nHowever, in FRC, the general philosophy for dependencies is “latest is correct”. Vendors and wpi and robotpy almost never break backward compatibility mid-season, and almost always are only fixing bugs. Additionally, competitions often check/force minimum software versions.\n\nSpecific to robotpy, unfortunately I don’t have specific directions. The core I would make sure of is to confirm the set of software (vendor deps, wpilib, robotpy, etc.) all matches some tested set of software that someone else has worked with.",
