Could you share any recent information?\n\nOur current lathe is a LittleMachineShop HiTorque 3595 8.5x20 Deluxe Bench Lathe:\n\n[Image source]\n\nWe've faced several issues: tailstock misalignment, DRO failure, and inconsistent positioning. These problems have made low-tolerance operations challenging. We're exploring alternatives within budget constraints, prioritizing size and accuracy close to our current setup. A proper DRO is essential, and preference for English Imperial units is a plus. A stable base is also important.\n\nAny suggestions or experiences are welcome.",

A MISTAKE BEING JUST AN INJURY (IE, MACHINE STALS VS. PULLS YOU THROUGH IT)  \n\nLARGE BORE IS NICELY SO YOU CAN TAKE SOMETHING LIKE 1.25\" STOCK THROUGH THE SPINDLE (NOT SUPER LONG WITHOUT A SPINDLE LINER, BUT SAY 12-18\" OF MATERIAL), AND YOU CAN MAKE A PART, PART IT OFF, ADVANCE THE MATERIAL, MAKE A PART, PART IT OFF, ETC. DEFINITELY SPRING FOR THE AXA STYLE WEDGE TOOL POST OR GET ANOTHER_VENDOR’S  \n\nAS REFERENCE, I HAVE AN 11X27 VARIABLE SPEED FROM PM FROM ~2016 I BOUGHT, AND I’VE RUN BIGGER AND SMALLER MANUAL LATHE, CNC LATHE, ETC. THE ONE I BOUGHT FOR 3005 WAS A GRIZZLY ~10X24 OR SO MANUAL, AND IT WAS NOTICEABLY LESS “FUN” TO USE THAN MY HOME LATHE, IN TERMS OF FIT/FINISH, ABILITY TO CHANGE SPEEDS (CHANGE GEARS VS. VFD DRIVE), ETC. AS I RECALL I PAID ~$1500-$2K FOR THAT ONE IN ~2018-2019. I’VE RUN UP TO ~14X30-40’S IN THE 3-5HP RANGE IN A SCHOOL SETTING, AND WHILE “NICE”, THEY ARE NO “NICER” THAN THE PM IN TERMS OF FIT/FINISH, AND JUST ADD MORE HORSEPOWER/SIZE/RISK THAN I NEED FOR THE SIZE PARTS I MAKE. I’VE ALSO RUN DOWN TO THE “MICRO Sized” $500 LATHES YOU SEE AT HARBOR FREIGHT, ETC… AND I’D CONSIDER THEM “OK” FOR ILLUSTRATING CONCEPTS OR MAKING SMALL PARTS OUT OF 1/2\" ALUMINUM/PLASTIC, WITH MINIMAL RISK/COST, BUT QUICKLY FRUSTRATING IF YOU ARE TRYING TO MAKE ACTUAL PARTS TO A REAL TOLERANCE. A GOOD MACHINIST CAN MAKE A LOT WITH A POOR TOOL, BUT YOU ARE WORKING PAST/AROUND THE TOOL  \n\nEDIT → ONE LAST THING TO ADD, DEFINITELY GET THE DRO. I HAVEN’T RUN IT IN A SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT ON A LATHE, BUT I HAVE ON A 3 AXIS MILL. I LEARNED WITHOUT IT, SO IT ISN’T AS HUGE BENEFIT FOR ME, HOWEVER, THE ABILITY FOR THE CAD STUDENTS TO MAKE A DRAWING, HAND IT IT TO THE “MACHINIST STUDENTS”, AND PLAY “DRIVE TO THE NUMBER”, REALLY WORKED OUT WELL. ON THE 3 AXIS, WE’D OFTEN HAVE THINGS LIKE ALUMINUM TUBING AND A SERIES OF HOLES, WITH ONE STUDENT CALLING OUT THE DIMENSION AND THE OTHER DRIVING TO IT. IT REALLY SEEMED TO HELP THEM TRANSLATE BETWEEN “THE NUMBERS ON THE MACHINE” AND “THE NUMBERS ON THE DRAWING” IN A WAY THAT MY BRAIN DID AUTOMATICALLY, BUT THEIRS DIDN’T INITIALLY. IT ALSO HELPS GREASE THE MENTAL RAILS TOWARD CNC AS WELL",

The 5C collet chucks have proven beneficial, reducing errors caused by the kids failing to center their workpiece properly. For those experiencing issues with machine backlash, we highly recommend purchasing a DRO from Amazon. Additionally, another product on Amazon facilitates creating numerous identical parts efficiently. The included image provides further details on the lathe model.",

It boasts ample through-bore capacity, eliminating the need for multiple chuck jaws. If you require a chuck, simply attach it to a collet held on an arbor.  \n\nTeam 3494 utilizes one of these lathes paired with a discontinued ER40 collet chuck (0.78\" through-bore, 1\" max capacity) and a Chinese brushless sewing machine motor. The Taig Micro II lathe demonstrates exceptional capability, outperforming previous Taiwanese machines in stiffness and offering precise measurements via the z-axis depth stop, feeler gauge, gage blocks, and dial indicator on a magnetic base. Each tool has its own post, allowing swift tool changes akin to a quick-change system, though lacking positional repeatability. The optional compound slide enhances functionality, enabling taper cuts over the past three years. While headstock and tailstock risers are available, they haven't been necessary. Thread cutting with taps and dies is common practice. The lever tailstock ensures reliable feedback and efficient hole deepness measurements. Although a DRO isn't deemed essential, a basic 2-axis machine suffices for novices to build foundational skills before advancing to a more sophisticated 3-axis setup, which pairs well with a 2- or 3-axis DRO.",

                    "cooked": "Before buying a new lathe, I suggest better understanding the problems with the current lathe. Is it actually broken/badly made, or is it just needing some maintenance? Some thoughts on the DRO gizmos showing that it doesn’t hold position: Is this when the carriage/cross slide are unlocked, or locked? Does a dial indicator show these same jumps, or only the DRO? Are all of the gib screws as snug as they can be without dragging on the ways? Are the gibs, ways, leadscrews, and rack clean and oiled? Are the DRO scales fully secured? Are the toolpost, compound slide angle, headstock, chuck, and chuck backing plate secure? Are all of the tool heights on center? The cheap little DRO gizmos are cheap-in-a-bad-way. If the biggest problem with yours is just the batteries dying, I’ve seen people hardwire them for power by soldering wires from a 3V power supply onto the battery tabs. If yours are so bad that they’re not worth looking at, you can also remove them. Then you could use the lathe manually without being distracted by wrong numbers, or you could install a proper DRO.",

                    "cooked": "The carriage/cross slide are either unlocked or locked based on the operation of the machine. None of the axis' have locks on them at all by design. The closest thing to a “lock” would be engaging the power feed.\n\nDoes a dial indicator show these same jumps, or only the DRO? None of the knobs that have DROs on them have mechanical dial indicators. It’s either digital, or you’re working blind. The Z-axis is a mechanical dial-only, but the dial appears to be metric (or at least doesn’t follow imperial increments when measured; without metric calipers it’s hard to verify).\n\nYou can actually feel it when turning the knob, it’s like you hit a spot of no resistance, the DRO will jump when this happens, but the tool itself will not.\n\nAre all of the gib screws as snug as they can be without dragging on the ways? Are the gibs, ways, leadscrews, and rack clean and oiled?\n\nI haven’t personally used the machine that much, but the mentors on the team that do I would think are familiar enough with it to check those things periodically, but these issues have been fairly long term.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the DROs only read the rotation of the knobs they’re mounted to, there are no scales on the axis themselves. The DROs are cheap/fragile enough that we’re not confident if we were to take them apart to inspect the scales (if there are any), that we could get them back together again.\n\nEverything seems pretty secure with the exception of the tailstock which was garbage literally from day one. We got it replaced at one point which helped a bit, but our mentors that use the machine more regularly commented “it’s a bad design” so there’s only so much they can do with it. For most of what we use it for it’s been “good enough.”\n\nNot the last one I used, but I was aware of that going in (like I said, I don’t use the lathe regularly, so I didn’t really know the correct way to center the tool) and that wasn’t the primary issue. I basically referenced the tool off of a shaft that was already the size I wanted to zero everything, then I replaced the shaft with the larger one to be turned down and attempted to run the tool back to that same zero but the machine couldn’t even do that (it was like 0.15\" over sized).",
