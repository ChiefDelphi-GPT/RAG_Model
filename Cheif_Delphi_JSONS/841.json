I am developing a team in the public education network in the interior of Brazil.\n\nAs a mentor, we are almost finishing the training for electrical and mechanical engineering, but our programming is stalled due to indecision when choosing an initial language for development:\n\nWhat I know about the tools (I don’t know much because I’m a beginner in programming, sorry if some terms or statements are wrong, subject to corrections) =\n\n• Python: Easy to understand and get started with codes. Officially supported since 2024 by RoboRIO, stable documentation but few resources in the community)\n\n• Java: The nightmare of about % of developers (not for FRC , due to the large amount of tutorials and diverse resources in the community, such as CD , YouTube, Workshops, Websites, etc.), although difficult to understand at first contact for beginners\n\n• C++: I develop for a battlebot team in which I work, but for FRC I don’t see many teams using it (sorry for the ignorance)\n\n• LabVIEW: The best team in our country used it but migrated to Java, for navigation, odometry, kinematics and various tasks The control system’s actions are facilitated (we had a meeting with them about this). Since it is a block-structured language, there are limitations in terms of organization and programmable logic.\n\nI appreciate everyone’s feedback in advance! Thank you for taking the time to help a rookie team!",

Once a team has a few years under their belt, they can start planning out more long-term, but a rookie team should really take advantage of whatever areas that have existing support for.\n\nThat said, python and java are the only real answers here.  The new control system coming in 2027 is exceptionally unlikely to support labview, and C++ can get complicated rather quickly.  Java has a significant margin ahead of the other options, tons of existing documentation and other resources, and really isn’t too terrible to learn.  Python is even easier to learn, but can certainly be “done wrong” (as all languages can).  Both java and python are taught as entry-level languages across high school/college classes depending on region.",

You should probably stick to whatever you have the most experience with (I’d guess that’s why it took so long for 1156 to transition from LabVIEW, actually. They just had enough people with enough experience for it to be actually viable).\n\nHowever, I would really like to bias you towards Java. I found Java in FRC to not be that bad really, even as a beginner. Also, the community support aspect is great. It is by far the most used language and is likely to stay that way:\n\nI really want to emphasize the community support. Something I realized when I first started programming for our team was that Java, C++ and Python already have enough generic learning material out there. If you have a question about the language itself, you will find an answer somewhere. However, if you need help with frc specific things, such as figuring out how to use a specific motor controller, it really pays off to have such a large userbase backing you.",

And, I’m glad we went with Java.\n\nAs far as mentor involvement, I’ve found the following details as the most critical for language choice\n\nBeing able to use community code and get help\n\nBeing able to spot obvious errors easily\n\nBeing able to spot really non-obvious errors and track logic flow easily\n\nUnfortunately, java comes ahead on all three fronts. I’d never want to use Python, because issues like “a variable name is misspelled” can result in correct syntax but wrong behavior, and be extremely challenging to find. In Java, this class of errors is obviously wrong by way of a syntax error. Similarly, if you miss a bracket, it’s an actual error, and not code that reads fine and executes wrong. Having those issues go away lets you focus on the big issues, like actually making your robot work as intended. Back when we had to code computer vision on coprocessors using Python, these sneaky issues were major time sinks that kept us from actually making things work.\n\nBeyond that, you’re basically just doing the same thing: Teaching the basic fundamentals of the language, how to write programs, and using the WPILib Framework + vendor libraries. I don’t think the syntax of any available language is so challenging that being familiar with it is a notable advantage or rules it out*\n\n* (excepting functional languages like Rust, which I encourage them to learn but am not about to teach)",

Java forces explicit declarations, minimizing this issue since typo’d variable doesn’t exist, and can’t be assigned to at all. This explicitness is annoying, but gives good structure for finding issues.\n\nThat said, I haven’t actually used python in an FRC context, or even recently. I imagine the static analysis tools have significantly improved, but there’s some fundamentals of how Python’s syntax works that I don’t know how would be meaningfully patched out.",

For 2027 and beyond, I think Python will be much more common of an entry point because we will have a lot of students starting with Blockly (which generates Python code).  It seems unlikely that teams who start with Blockly will jump to Java instead of Python.",
