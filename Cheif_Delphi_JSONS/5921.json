                    "cooked": "The SleipnirGroup team of developers invites all FRC teams to participate in our open beta of Choreo , a fully-featured trajectory optimization-based swerve drive autonomous path planning app.\n\nChoreo is a tool for transforming 2D paths from rough sketches into optimal trajectories. With minimum-travel-time paths that respect your robot’s physical properties and limits, you can have a high degree of trust that your robot will be able to follow Choreo’s paths on the first try.\n\nUsing CasADi, an industry-leading numerical optimization software, Choreo treats trajectory planning as a minimum-time problem, automatically refining both the shape of the path and the robot’s velocity and acceleration along it. CasADi is integrated into Choreo and does not require a separate installation.\n\nChoreo always respects your robot’s physical properties and limits, applying them to a simplified kinodynamic model of a swerve drive. By applying custom constraints, Choreo enables precise control of what you want your robot to do along the path. This means that you don’t have to “fudge” your path much to make it do what you want.\n\nChoreo integrates with your robot project by providing JSON trajectory files that your robot reads and follows during the autonomous period of the FRC match, providing minimal overhead and points of failure. We provide a Java vendor library with a utility to load these trajectory files and a command factory to follow them.\n\nChoreo is a fully open source project developed and maintained by the active and welcoming Sleipnir Discord server . Feel free to ask any questions there, and we will help you get Choreo integrated into your workflow. Issues with the Choreo app should be posted on the GitHub Issues tracker .\n\nPrior spline-based path planning tools (e.g. PathPlanner) allow users to draw a spline curve to define the shape of the path, and the tools determine the robot’s motion along that path according to the robot’s velocity and acceleration limits.\n\nIn contrast, Choreo uses a numerical optimization software to generate trajectories. With this technology, we refine the exact shape and motion of the path based on a set of user-specified requirements. These requirements currently include waypoints, custom constraints, and the physical properties of the robot, but the numerical optimization approach could be used with other constraints such as field obstacles.\n\nChoreo’s optimization software seeks the path that passes through all waypoints, obeys all requirements, and does so in the shortest possible time. This approach means that trajectory generation is a compute-heavy process and can sometimes fail if the robot cannot physically obey all requirements. This approach unfortunately makes Choreo a poor fit for OTF/realtime path generation.\n\nDuring the 2021 FIRST Robotics Competition season (INFINITE RECHARGE at Home), FRC 604 developed Quikplan, a differential-drive optimizer, for that year’s autonomous challenges. Like Choreo, Quickplan used CasADi to generate paths with minimal travel times that also obey the robot’s physics constraints. Quickplan also demonstrated obstacle avoidance.\n\nChoreo currently only supports swerve drives, but differential drive support is planned.\n\nChoreo is the evolution of several years of research and development in trajectory optimization by the contributors. Triple Helix Robotics collaborated on FRC 319’s BobTrajectory, a spline-based path planner and trajectory generator for differential-drives, from 2018 to 2021. After the 2021 season, Triple Helix took inspiration from FRC 604’s Quikplan and began developing HelixTrajectory (now SleipnirGroup’s TrajoptLib), a C++ library for optimizing swerve trajectories. HelixNavigator, the JavaFX-based trajectory optimization UI, was created to provide a simple, visual interface for HelixTrajectory. HelixNavigator later evolved into the web-on-desktop-based UI called Choreo. Choreo was first used in competition at Chezy Champs 2023 by team 8033, and soon after at Madtown Throwdown 2023 by team 6657.\n\nHeading angles do not currently wrap around.\n\nWe plan to make the workflow more integrated with robot projects.\n\nWe plan to make the configuration of the robot physical properties more user-friendly.\n\nFor best results, add a waypoint zero angular velocity constraint (second from the right in the top bar) to Start and End. The default path settings will be improved to include these.\n\nThank you to all contributors for your hard work over the past year!\n\nSleipnirGroup Contributors\n\n@calcmogul – Sleipnir, TrajoptLib\n\n@Amicus1 – Choreo Frontend Lead\n\n@JN25 – Choreo Frontend, Sleipnir\n\n@justinb – Choreo Backend Lead, TrajoptLib, HelixNavigator creator\n\n@dydx – Sleipnir\n\nTriple Helix Robotics - FRC 2363\n\nHighlander Robotics - FRC 8033\n\nArborbotics - FRC 6657\n\nAnd many others who tested the app and contributed ideas!",

Choreo’s backend, Trajoptlib, supports adding field obstacles which we have tested. Unfortunately having more than a couple of obstacles severely impacts generation time and reliability, but obstacles high on my list of things to work on for Choreo at the moment. The main blocker is finding a faster way to make them work or adding support for them in the gui to limit the number of obstacles in each path.",

                    "cooked": "It’s fairly difficult to get an “all else being equal” comparison because the PathPlanner user actually overconstrains the problem into being suboptimal to actually impossible to follow, depending on how high the maximum velocity and acceleration constraints are. The important difference is that in PathPlanner the only constraints applied explicitly are maximum chassis velocity and acceleration along the spline. Rotational velocity and acceleration were not considered in PathPlanner 2023, and IIRC only considered robot-side in 2024 (meaning rotation is done with whatever module speed is not used for translation, but the path is not required to leave enough time for rotation).\n\nMeanwhile Choreo starts by limiting the velocity and torque applied at each wheel, with chassis velocity and angular velocity constraints (among others) applied on top of that if specified. This has two noticeable effects. One, the path will have time to hit both the rotation and translation elements of the waypoints. Two, the generated paths perform rotation during translational acceleration and deceleration, in order to maximize the portion of module speed used for translation at “cruising” speed.\n\nOverall, the trapezoid-profile-along-spline approach can generate feasible paths if spinning is not too aggressive and/or the path constraints are well under the actual robot limits. Unfortunately, you leave a lot of performance on the table doing this, which is a limitation Choreo seeks to avoid.",

                    "cooked": "We’ll probably end up doing something like PathPlanner’s system of stop points, where you can split your trajectory at waypoints where linear and angular velocity are zero. This would be a basic way to draw one path and be able to schedule commands in parallel with segments or in pauses between trajectories. This is your option A. Something like PathPlanner’s marker system is pretty nice when you’re not necessarily stopping. One difficulty with implementing a similar system here is that outside of waypoints, you wouldn’t be able to trigger a command when the robot passes through a particular pose (because the exact path shape isn’t under your control). Placing command markers based on time elapsed after/before a waypoint could work though.\n\nSo a hypothetical command-marker system would probably have two options: Stop Points: These would be commands fired at points that are constrained to 0 linear/angular velocity. They could be wait-until-finish or wait-specified-time before moving along the path again. Stop Point commands that are wait-specified-time and require the drive subsystem would be interrupted after that time, other wait-specified time commands would continue until interrupted by the end of the last path segment or another command marker. Mid-path: These would be commands fired a specified time before/after a waypoint (and not necessarily a 0-velocity waypoint). They wouldn’t stop motion, and they could be interrupted by hitting another marker that requires the same subsystem (because how else could this be handled).\n\nEach marker would have at least one command tag associated with it. Command tags are basically strings, but selected from a project-wide list to avoid mistyping and allow multiple commands to be associated with markers. Robot-code-side, you would populate a map of strings to Supplier (best to create new command instances for each auto for various reasons), similar to PathPlanner.\n\nI’m kind of designing this system as I type it, and there’s probably issues with this idea that I don’t know about, so let me know if this makes sense for your usecase(s).\n\nAs for your second question, we currently don’t support starting one path with the end state of another, because you have to regenerate both if one changes (unless you have the start of one and end of the other fully constrained, i.e. to a stop point).",

Your work here looks fantastic on paper and we’d love to give it a go. That said, we really don’t want to tune and run two different path followers. Please consider adopting or collaborating on the same file format. It would be a big improvement for ease of adoption.",
