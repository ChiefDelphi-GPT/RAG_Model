                    "cooked": "Hello! My team has designed and built an arm system that features 4 falcons on a (currently) 240:1 gear ratio designed to power our shoulder joint. In testing, we’ve encountered a couple of problems, it oscillates quite a bit despite chain being tensioned, and it being overall mechanically as sound as it can be at the moment(though were are looking to increase sprocket sizes for less working load on the chain, and for more teeth grab, as well as increasing the gear ratio, its mega fast right now…) though this is the case, we have been trying to tune it as best we can, after all, we are a week 1 competition so we are working with what we have for now. I’m wondering what the best control system would given this information. We have loads of experience with wpi pids, including trapezoidal motion profiled systems and systems that use feed forward gains using system identification. However, in this particular instance, we started by looking at CTRE PIDs which are new to us this year(we have used them on our swerve drive and telescoping arm) we did this because of their higher refresh rate of 1ms as well as their onboard motion magic. Though this is the case, I still could not get it to decelerate properly, my guess is poor tuning, but figuring out how to tune it “right” is difficult, despite following the documentation. I’m wondering if I should keep tuning using this, even if it will take a couple more hours to tune, but it has the benefit of having elegant acceleration and deceleration, or if I should throw in the towel and look towards something like a regular pid, or running something onboard the rio. Thank you!",

But yeah, we are going to increase the gear ratio, and drop 2 motors in our next iteration. No need to run at 159 degrees per second at 13 amps on each motor LOL. Good learning experience though",
