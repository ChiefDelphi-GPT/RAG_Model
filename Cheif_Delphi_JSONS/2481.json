                    "cooked": "Greetings, I’m Eren. I work in the software department of the 9436 team. We use Neo 1.1 motors and mk4 L1 swerve module in our robot. We also use Ctre cancoder. We also use Navx2 as a gyroscope. We have already started to improve ourselves for the next season and we want to use the advantage kit in the next season. For this, we thought your max_swerve example was a good start and we took your max swerve example and changed it to adjust the positions of the neo encoders via the cancoders. Then we adjusted the pid for rotation and decided that the p value of 2.8 works well for us. Then we started driving the robot. We can move the robot, but the controls are not what we want. Especially during the first movement, we noticed that it suddenly accelerated. For this, we plan to try to drive by squaring the value coming from the joystick, but I’m not sure if this will be enough. Also, sometimes when the robot was moving, although I only gave the forward command, the robot went in the direction it should go, but the robot turned a little around its axis. So the yaw value changed a little. We want this not to happen and actually we want it to be perfectly controllable. Can you help us?\n\nOur code: GitHub - Giro-FRC/AdvantageKitSwerve: AdvantageKitSwerve in off season\n\nDriving Video: Giro - Google Drive",

Swerve is an underactuated system, which are incredibly hard to control perfectly, and also has non-zero latency. FRC teams usually ignore these dynamics to simplify the controls problem, and this skew is the result of doing so.\n\nThe lazy way to fix the problem is to shove a PI controller on the rotation axis such that it will try to lock the rotation when the driver is not requesting any rotation and should work decently enough. Fixing the skew properly is a graduate-level problem that I don’t even know how to properly pose, and is just not something any FRC team has ever done.",

Do a search for swerve “drift” here on CD and you’ll find many topics discussing the problem.\n\nUsing an “attitude” or yaw controller as mentioned by @Alex_Y is a way some teams address the problem.  Before doing that, though, I’d suggest that you try to address underlying issues that might be contributing to the problem.\n\nMake sure your chassis is square in the sense that it has precisely 90 degree angles at each corner.  Use a large framing square to check and as an alignment guide.\n\nMake sure that each module is turning freely for both steering and drive.  All bearings need to be in good condition.  Be sure there is no debris like carpet fibers built up between moving and fixed components.  Be sure modules are assembled correctly such that bearings are running on bosses (if applicable) rather than on flat surfaces.\n\nMake sure your module rotational offsets are set correctly.  Use any alignment feature that may be built-in to your modules to set them straight, but also double-check using a straight piece of tubing to align pairs of wheels straight relative to each other.\n\nCheck the steering (azimuth) control for all modules while loaded with full robot weight on carpet.  Use a logging framework to capture module rotation setpoints, actual rotation, and motor voltage and something like Advantage Scope to visualize the steering controller performance.  Steering control should be very quick.  I like to tune it up with just a tiny bit of overshoot so actual tracks the setpoint very responsively.  Steering control response of all modules should be essentially identical.\n\nConsider using velocity controllers on the module wheels if your swerve code can incorporate it.  Feedforward should be doing 90+% of the work to control wheel velocity and P feedback should handle the rest.  I try to avoid overshoot on velocity controllers and look for more of a critically damped response.\n\nIf you are running wheel speeds in open-loop rather than with velocity control, measure wheel speeds vs. voltage input  with the full weight robot on carpet using a logging/visualization combo as mentioned above.  If wheel speeds are not nearly identical at a given voltage, recheck mechanical issues as mentioned above.",

For this, we plan to try to drive by squaring the value coming from the joystick, but I’m not sure if this will be enough\n\nI’m not sure I see this in the video.\n\nYour code is using a deadband of .1 for the joysticks, remapping values above .1 to 0-1, and squaring those values. That’s basically the standard for joystick input handling in FRC , so I doubt your problem is in the code.\n\nThe first thing I’d check is your actual joysticks. Make sure the output from your controller is linear and controllable between .1 and 1. If not, swapping/upgrading your controllers may be necessary. Over the years I’ve found high quality controllers to be well worth the cost (we currently use Razor Wolverine V2s which have incredible joysticks) and would highly recommend upgrading.\n\nAfter joysticks are ruled out, you might consider using SlewRateLimiters to control acceleration or adding a slow/“precision” drive mode with a lower top speed for close quarters maneuvers.",
