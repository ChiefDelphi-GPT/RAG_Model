                    "cooked": "“new members of our software team have some programming or Java knowledge”\n\nI think the first step would be nailing down where everyone’s skill is. People can come into FIRST at a wide range of skill levels. It might be worth having them go through some basic Java challenges first. I personally recommend Code.org for some basic object oriented training. Some of the challenges definitely seem like they are for a younger audience, but when I was first learning to program they very much helped me with the way I was thinking about the object related problems (and personally I’m of the opinion that every resource is valuable, no matter what age group it was designed for). Those challenges do a nice job of teaching basic items that are common among many programming languages (think things like methods, variables, data types, etc.), plus it’s free.\n\nIf you have some students who are already a bit knowledgeable with java I would recommend having them go through some Codingbat challenges. Its a great refresher on Java syntax and there is an abundance of problems to work through. Plus, for someone who is freshly learning the language it provides great repetition to build up skill.\n\nAnother thing I would recommend. If your high school offers AP Computer Science A, I would strongly suggest that you recommend your new programmers to take it (as much as I despise the College Board). I might even go as far as saying that all of your programmers should take it. I have heard it from a couple of other programmers that the class actually really helped them with Java (one of them has been a lead programmer on another team for close to 2 years now). It also has the added benefit of potentially increasing the rigor of some peoples schedules and introducing people to the AP system (once again, I very much dislike the College Board).\n\nOnce you are ready to start introducing people into robot based projects, I’d start with something simple. Like coding a tank Drive base. Throwing people into the deep end here is not the best idea. I’d recommend that it is as close to a pair project as possible. One newer programmer, and one more experienced programmer. The important thing here is that the goal of the project is to improve the skill of the newer programmer, the skill improvement with the more experienced programmer will come through the teaching. The best way to learn and get better is to teach after all. Its critical that the newer programmer understands what is going on, why things are written the way they are written, and why certain sections of code are located where they are in the code (think the periodic section).\n\nFor my team we have an old Octocanum bot from a long time ago (2015 I think?). This bot is a good starting place because it introduces basic wiring, different types of wheels and drive systems (tank, and mecanum), and solenoids. On the surface level the code for the bot is fairly simplistic and its a great starting place for some people. It also has the added benefit of being a great defense bot for drive practice.\n\nThis is just my advice, I highly encourage you to check out the other resources that other people may have posted.",

This summer the new programming students will be rewriting the competition code for our robot Maestro for training, with help from the programming lead and experienced programmers.\n\nThere’s really a ton of ways you can go about training students on programming, my general advice would be making sure they have hands on experience with a robot.",
