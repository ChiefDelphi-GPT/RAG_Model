In personally working on both SDS’s MK2’s and MK3’s from a programming perspective, I have found there to be far fewer resources when it comes to working examples. Something I found to be extremely useful, this summer when our team was trying to get our first swerve bot up and running, was SDS’s out-of-the-box MK2 code . This allowed us to test and troubleshoot our build, and electrical system right out of the gate. However, I have yet to find this kind of out-of-the-box code for SDS’s MK3 modules. This was entirely true until about a week ago when this post was made. Although much of the footwork was already done by the WPI library and @Zach_O , in testing we found that an important step was missed.\n\nAn important part in getting swerve to work is aligning the wheels and recording their individual offsets into the code so that they all point in the correct direction. By the nature of the mag encoders commonly used in the MK3 modules, it is unlikely that the magnets will be placed perfectly in the 0 position relative to the sensor. In short, you need to be able to calibrate each individual wheel. I made two other minor changes like using Kauali lab’s NavX as a gyroscope and allowing for mid-match recalibration of the gyroscope using the left-bumper.\n\nSo ta-da: here is the code Check the readme for instructions and feel free to ask questions.\n\nMuch thanks to @Zach_O and the work he did that allowed us to complete the project so quickly.\n\nHere are some pictures and videos of the bot!\n\nVideo 1 Video 2\n\nFile_000 4032×3024 2.53 MB File_001 3024×4032 2.84 MB\n\nFile_000 4032×3024 2.53 MB\n\nFile_000 4032×3024 2.53 MB\n\nFile_001 3024×4032 2.84 MB\n\nFile_001 3024×4032 2.84 MB\n\nFor more on the design, build, and history of the project check out this",

                    "cooked": "Hey! A few notes on this -\n\nThe integratedSensorOffsetDegrees isn’t what you want to use here. You’re not interfacing with the integrated sensor in the TalonFX - you’re using the CANCoder as your sensor. You should use the magnetOffsetDegrees on a CANCoderConfiguration to set the offset. I believe that allows you to avoid storing that offset variable in your swerve module object and you can use the CANCoder’s getAbsolutePosition method without having to do any addition. I haven’t tested this (I don’t have any swerve modules), so if you’d like to try it and report back, that would be helpful.\n\nNot setting the CANCoder’s offset this way/using the offset only in-memory will cause the PID controllers on the TalonFX to read a different value then you’re reading in your code. Hopefully it makes sense why this would be an issue and why integratedSensorOffsetDegrees isn’t doing anything for you in this setup.\n\nI also opted to use the Rotation2d class to represent the offset for the module, since it allows teams to talk in radians or degrees when instantiating their swerve module objects. It reduces some of the sharp edges in the implementation presented above.\n\nI’ve updated my code example to reflect these changes - here’s the link to the individual commit that talks about the suggestions above\n\nExample code for the Swerve Drive Specialties MK3 module - ZachOrr/MK3-Swerve-Example\n\nEdit: I’m also unsure why you’d want to change the max speed for the swerve modules . Did you gear your MK3 modules differently than they ship? The free speeds for the modules are 13.6 ft/sec or 16.2 ft/sec, depending on the gear ratio you buy. I’m curious where that 20 ft/sec value came from.",

We only ever made it to a crab (2 steering motors, 4 wheels), which didn’t hold up as well I think yours could for competitions.\n\nBoth code and mechanical design has converged a lot in last 2-3 years, and while games might not have specific swerve advantages, there will be more even for slight advantages in more future games.  It is the smart move I think to get manufactured modules, unless you are well equipped to machine yourself, though even that is getting less of a barrier with 3d printed modules.\n\nGetting this all together and running is a awesome milestone.  I remember how impressed by the turning wheels and swerve (or crab in our case) movements, that our engineering mentor was, that you could see it on his face.  That alone made it feel like a great accomplishment, and I think that is the same for any doing this and seeing it actual working.  So pretty cool 1710!",

                    "cooked": "Interesting, what kind of encoder/potentiometer did you all use to zero the turning motors? I’m sure @hudsonh can speak more as to how our turning has been working.\n\nWe went with the MA3 Encoders for our MK2 robot ( US Digital® | Products | MA3 | Miniature Absolute Magnetic Shaft Encoder ). With MK2 we ran into a lot of trouble with the zeroing. MK3 has been a substantial improvement. The magnet for the encoder is directly embedded into the main shaft and the encoder itself rests above it. The MK2 modules have an encoder with a gear interface. The MK3 Interface has significantly less points of failure. Here are the Cancoders we got Cross the Road Electronics .\n\nWe also experienced some motor slop/backlash with the MK2 modules. This seems to be due to the multiple gears on the main center driving shaft. The MK3’s however have a single machined gear in the middle which, even after testing, have negligible backlash. I’ll be sure to update this post if the backlash shows over time with more wear and tear on the gears.\n\nWe will have to look more into the gyro issues. The bass from the music messed up your gyros? We’ll have to test with some FRC classics and see if we can reproduce the issue.\n\nThanks for the reply!",

It has really helped out our team, but we are having a few issues with the code and we aren’t sure if we are doing something wrong. We followed the steps in your read me and we think we got all the offsets but yet our wheels still don’t align properly. What we did was that we cloned the repo added ours id’s and commented out the lines of code we were told to comment out (some lines were shifted a bit but we found them) we put the wheels where they would be when our alignment code and then moved the wheels to there spots and got the numbers and put them into the offsets in the code, when we try to move the robot all the wheels are going which way.\n\nCan help us out?\n\nThanks in advance!",
