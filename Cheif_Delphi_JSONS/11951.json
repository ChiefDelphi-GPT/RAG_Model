A sponsor has made a donation for my team to buy a CNC router. The mentor from this sponsor likes (and so do we!) the Axiom Pro AR8 . We were hoping to buy it back in December, but school progress on connecting 240v to our work space was slow. Now things are aligning and we want to make the purchase.*\n\nCAD: we use Onshape\n\nAxiom sells two software packages ( Aspire v11x , vCarve pro ), and I don’t know which would be best for standard FRC manufacturing. Or, if there is something else the community recommends. Maybe something cheaper!\n\nOur usage: likely doing a lot of polycarb parts out of 1/8 or 1/4 sheets, also parts from similar thickness aluminum, and cutting pockets or holes in rectangular tubing. I’m sure we’ll experiment with a lot more, but for now we want to be able to start making replacement parts for our current robot in time for a week 4 regional… you know, just incase things break at our week 2.\n\nAll suggestions welcome!\n\n*I was told by an Axiom rep that in March they will be offering the router table free with purchase of the router. So we’re waiting until then.",

I even have templates and tool libraries available. My workflow is downloading CAD from Onshape, import to fusion, arrange parts on sheet, apply CAM, generate G code. The flow is probably similar for the router CAMs you’re looking at. Generally, router-specofic CAM programs have better tools for working with sheet metal, but lack finesse or the ability to tweak things. Easier to use, less flexible.\n\nThe router you’re looking at looks similar to an Omio in terms of capabilities, so it should be good. That said, bang for the buck, the Omio still reigns supreme. It does have more bugs than the Axiom is likely to have.\n\nFor tooling, Thriftybot and WCP have great endmills. You can also get a pack of 30 from Grewin in China for about $140 shipped, for a combo of 4mm and 6mm endmills. This is the old Ozzyboards supplier. You need a quote and stuff to buy from them so it’s a little inconvenient.",

I have used both, and I have the free vcarve license that came with my shopsabre. Both work alright, but aren’t the best for FRC (and the prices Vectric charges are unreasonable). They are really best suited for woodshop use. 99.9% of the CAM work (both mill & router) I do happens in Fusion 360, which is both free (for education) and significantly more powerful. I occasionally pull out Vcarve pro for some “artsy” wood projects, but that is about it.\n\nFor your use case, I would strongly recommend Fusion. It is an actual 3D CAM platform and the tools allow for much more precise control of cut settings and toolpaths. Aside from just being more capable, it’s a better program for students to learn, with industry-level concepts and techniques. I would just make sure that Axiom has a Fusion 360 post-processor.",

Some of the “better” tools like MasterCAM seem good for making really fancy, optimized toolpaths but not for just getting things done. Sorta like SOLIDWORKS vs CATIA. We ended up getting a license for vCarve but never used it. Might be better for, y’know, v-carving and tabbing parts but we don’t do it that way and exporting to an external tool is a pain.",

There were so many times when I just needed a one off part, and I was able to get it done in about 3-4 minutes of CAM time at most. You can get really fancy in Mastercam, or do some really quick and dirty toolpaths. It’s up to you,a nd what you’re trying to do. There (was, I think they obsoleted it finally) an integrated Mastercam for Solidworks add on as well, that you may still be able to get access to.",

I tried out fusion 360 can at the beginning of the season since that is what we are using for cad and I have to admit it’s a bit clunky, and less efficient. Vcarve is what we use for the majority of our cam and it’s pretty simple, easy to import vectors from drawing files, easy to create new designs, and really nice interface for choosing feed and speeds and such. I was a complete beginner to cam and picked the whole program up within an hour, it’s intuitive to learn which is a definite benefit because that way you can easily teach multiple people on your team to use it.\n\nI have mostly used it to cut poly, which it’s worked out well for, being able to easily configure pass depth, tabs, etc. I’ve also used it to cut brackets. One caveat I should add is I’ve only done 2d vector machining so far, so keep that in mind.",
