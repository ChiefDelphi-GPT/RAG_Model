Unfortunately, we didn’t have time to compete at the state or world level. Now, I’m looking to improve this project further and would appreciate advice on a few key aspects: how to effectively operate it, optimal torque and RPM settings, and the ideal degree of rotation. We are currently targeting approximately 6000 RPM with around 270 degrees of rotation, aiming for consistent three-point shooting accuracy at a 95-100% success rate.",

Additionally, 2012 footage would also be great to review.\n\n1: How to drive it\nswerve baby!!! Just kidding; your best bet is likely a tank with air tires to allow driving in various places. I've encountered many outreach environments with main-season robots, and I can say that swerve tends to leave noticeable tread marks, which people generally dislike.\n\nWe're considering around 6000 RPM and 270 degrees of rotation.\nIf I'm correct, 270 degrees was standard in 2022 (at least that's what we had).\n\nWe aim for consistent 95-100% makes on a 3-point shot from a basketball hoop.\nThis might be challenging, but it's achievable. One potential solution is using an April tag placed at the same height and a few inches forward from the goal. This setup likely requires something similar.\n\nHowever, if you bring your own hoop to different locations, mounting an April tag directly to the goal shouldn't be a significant issue.\n\nIf you lack the budget for a Limelight or can't obtain one, consider Photon Vision. It's a bit more involved but still reliable.\n\nIn conclusion,\nThis is a fantastic idea, and I think it would be awesome if you guys can get it fully functional! (As just a programmer, I wish I could offer more mechanical advice, but I can't.)",

Here's a cleaned-up version:\n\n\"I agree on the lot of power aspect. We used 4 redline motors on our shooter for that competition. Another important factor is the inflation level of the ball. A few psi differences can significantly affect how far the basketball is launched. In 2022, this wasn't as noticeable because the goal was only 4 feet wide. However, when aiming for a standard basketball hoop, even a 1-inch variance in the ball's size can make a big difference.\"",

This choice ensures that the robot won't damage the basketball court. The swerve robot, which has made around eight appearances, may have accidentally scuffed the NBA court during one of these demonstrations. As a result, it might have been banned from playing on the court and was forced to perform subsequent demonstrations from the sidelines. Their summer project involves building a dedicated basketball bot equipped with a turret that automatically tracks the basket. They are considering using foam basketballs for this project, which would allow the bot to practice catching passes from humans. One potential option they are exploring is the \"Silent Hoops Basketball,\" which is a 29.5-inch foam ball with some bounce, having a diameter of 9.4 inches.",

The meaning has been preserved while making it grammatically correct and properly punctuated.\n```\n\nThe user provided a specific task: they wanted me to clean up some text by removing HTML tags and unnecessary elements. They emphasized preserving the original meaning, formatting with proper grammar and punctuation, and keeping it as a single paragraph without line breaks. Also, they wanted minimal changes for coherence.\n\nLooking at the input, it's an HTML snippet from a forum or similar site. There are tags like `<aside>`, `</div>`, `<blockquote>`, etc. My goal was to strip these out and rephrase the content appropriately.\n\nI started by identifying the main elements: the username \"NYtoWI\", the post number, topic, and the actual message about reflective tape. The blockquote contained only the term \"strips of reflective tape,\" so that needed to be incorporated into the surrounding text smoothly.\n\nNext, I focused on the explanation part. The user wrote, \"Yep, which explains the bright green ring light around a camera at the top of the shooter.\" I checked if this made sense in context with the quoted term. It seems to connect the strips of reflective tape to the camera's light ring, possibly indicating a relationship between the two.\n\nI then considered how to combine these into one coherent sentence without losing clarity. Ensuring that the sentence flows naturally and maintains proper grammar was key. I also made sure to use appropriate punctuation, such as a comma after \"Yep.\"\n\nFinally, I reviewed the cleaned-up version to ensure all HTML tags were removed, the text was concise, and the meaning remained intact. No major changes were necessary beyond structural adjustments to meet the user's requirements.\n```",

Everyone working on it had earplugs for test sessions. I wouldn’t necessarily recommend it, but if you go this route, please be very careful and get a mentor to review it for safety. It is important that your flywheels are well-balanced and best if you can put a cage around them on the robot.\n\nTo hit from 3pt range, you will need the basketball to be going at least ~35 ft/s, which means the linear speed of your shooting wheel needs to be similar (and not lose energy during the shot, which is why we had big flywheels). The RPM depends on the size of your shooting wheel.\n\nI will also note something that we wished we changed - You should have a second wheel/roller at the top of the hood. We were wasting a lot of energy into putting an absurd amount of backspin onto the ball. You want some, probably, but not as much as you get if you have a single wheel powerful enough to shoot 3 point shots.\n\nThis is a detailed explanation about flywheels and their role in shooting a basketball.",

                    "cooked": "270° of travel is a reasonable number. I know that many teams in 2022 had around that much travel. Depending on your desires, you could explore doing more travel on a turret, so having to \"unwrap\" the turret is less common. Teams like 2910 and 254 had roughly 720° of travel on their turrets in 2024, which made them better at a role that required them to turn the robot a lot when intaking.\n\nI hope you're referring to the flywheel speed and not the final reduction on the turret, because 6000 RPM is an extremely high number for turret rotation. At that speed, you're looking at a full 270° sweep in under 8 milliseconds.\n\nThe motor power required to do this, coupled with the absurd speeds and the control loop timing, could easily tear this mechanism apart the first time it tried to run anywhere near full speed.\n\nFor some context: tracking a stationary goal while moving laterally at 20 ft/s halfway to the 3pt line only demands about 100°/sec of turret rotation. Even accounting for drivetrain rotation in the opposite direction at 360°/sec, 400–500°/sec (70–80 RPM) is already generous and gives you the headroom needed for fast, responsive aiming.\n\nAs for flywheel speeds: you can calculate an appropriate exit velocity based on the distances you want to shoot. Once you have a target exit velocity, you can back-calculate the necessary wheel surface speed. If you're using a passive hood, your shooter wheels will need a surface speed roughly twice your desired exit velocity. Keep in mind that real-world factors like slip and compression losses can reduce your actual exit speed, so it's smart to prototype and validate your numbers, or leave some headroom for tuning.\n\nAll of my math is back-of-the-napkin, so I heavily suggest doing your own calculations to find a good speed for your turret given the power and torque available from the motor you will have driving it and your desired tracking speeds, or at the very least, reference the ratios that teams have used in the past. I'd also look at the CAD that teams have published for turrets they have used in the past for inspiration on how to package and power them.",
