                    "cooked": "Our team is having issues with the Drivetrain. We have a West Coast style drivetrain and it worked for months, we have no clue what changed. Here is some of the troubleshooting methods we have done:\n\nVerify that each motor works. With the robot on a stand and wheels clear, we went through each gearbox and disconnected all but one motor on each side from their speed controllers. Each motor was able to drive the gearbox by itself, it appears that all motors are running and there are no electrical disconnects. With Digital Multi-Meter, measured resistance across each of the 3 pairs of windings on the motors, all read ~0.3 Ohm. Motors seem to be fine.\n\nVerify that it isn’t a code issue. Ran robot with latest code. With current limiting on, it stutters when accelerating. With current limiting off, it also stutters but appears to be browning out (recreating the problem we are trying to solve). Loaded an old version of code from AZ East regional, even reverting to the joysticks! Problem persists, it doesn’t appear to be a code issue.\n\nValidation that battery to Power Distribution Panel wiring is solid. Noted that the positive terminal of the wiring into the PDP was (every so slightly) loose. Removed terminals from PDP and inspected for arcing, but terminals were clean. Suspecting possible main breaker failure, bypassed the main breaker with a new one. Tested again, problem persists, so not the main breaker.\n\nVerify that each motor works under load. Reran the individual motor test, but this time under load. With robot on the ground and pushing against an obstacle, the robot is able to slip the wheels on the carpet with a single motor on each side. However, one motor on each side was unable to do so. When testing the suspect motors, the robot is able to drive, but at considerably less power. At this point, we have identified one set of motor / speed controller on each side of the robot that is unable to supply full power. If we remove these suspect motors from power, the robot should be able to run??? Conducted another test with the suspect motors disconnected from their speed controllers but all other motors connected. The robot seemed to be running just fine! At this point, we hypothesize that the suspect motor (being in brake mode) is providing excessive resistance to the gearbox when plugged in. Unsure if it’s one bad motor on each side of the robot, or one bad speed controller. Interestingly, it’s the same motor on each side.\n\nIdentify suspect speed controllers. Plugged into speed controllers via USB-C. Blinked each one to identify which speed controller was suspect on each side of the robot. We found speed controllers 1 and 4 were the suspect ones. This is weird, since they are apparently the lead speed controllers on each side of the robot, while 2 and 3 are following 1, 5 and 6 are following 4.\n\nChange lead speed controllers to verify that 1 and 4 are indeed bad. Repeated the single-motor-under-load test after adjusting the lead speed controllers to 2 and 5. Each single motor was able to slip the wheels with the robot pushing against an obstacle. It appears that the issue is gone!\n\nChange lead speed controllers back to 1 and 4 to verify. Repeated the single-motor-under-load test after putting the lead speed controllers back to 1 and 4. The issue is gone! This is perplexing, because all of the code is still the same, all of the wiring is the same, and all of the CAN configuration is the same.\n\nHowever, the day after this the issues came back and here are some notes we took: We added the speed controller outputs to the SmartDashboard as a graph to compare their outputs. The left side controllers tend to have outputs that track together fairly well. The right side followers have wildly different output voltages compared to each other and the right lead controller.  The only time they tracked together was when we disconnected the lead speed controller & motor.\n\nHere is the code: We are currently using the branch: state_champs\n\nstate_champs\n\nRapid React codebase.

They do paint an odd picture.\n\nI notice that you’re calling setSmartCurrentLimit(9) on the two leaders, but not the followers.  Firstly, 9A seems rather low; from some quick web searches, 30A seems like a common value for teams to use.  Secondly, I’m not sure what’s going to happen if the leader has a current limit but the followers don’t.  I suggest you try removing or raising that current limit and applying it consistently to all motors.\n\nAnother thing you might try, just to see if it makes a difference, is to use MotorControllerGroup instead of leader/follower, as shown in DifferentialDrive (WPILib API 2022.4.1)",

                    "cooked": "bovlb:\n\n30A seems like a common value for teams to use.\n\nI recommend using the ILITE drivetrain calculator to find a good current limit for tank drive robots. For 6 NEO like OP, 30A seems like a normal estimate.\n\nbovlb:\n\nSecondly, I’m not sure what’s going to happen if the leader has a current limit but the followers don’t.\n\nMy understanding is that the followers output the same voltage as the leader, which is communicated over CAN . My understanding about current limits is that voltage may drop in order to obey the current limit set. I’m not an EE though.\n\nOP, have you tried commenting out everything in code except the drivetrain, just to be sure nothing is interfering? That is, comment out all the non-drivetrain-related subsystems, commands, and button bindings in RobotContainer, then deploy and check the drivetrain behavior.\n\nIf you have a battery beak, look for the number labeled “Rint” – that’s your internal resistance of the battery. A higher internal resistance will die faster. If you’re using a battery from 2016 it’s probably just crap.\n\nAlso make sure you are not using a dead battery. I’ve wasted several cumulative hours on that over the years. Happens to the best of us.\n\nActually, re-reading:\n\nnancyesquivel10:\n\nWith current limiting on, it stutters when accelerating. With current limiting off, it also stutters but appears to be browning out (recreating the problem we are trying to solve).\n\nCurrent limit is a sticky setting. That means, when you set it, and turn the robot off and back on, your current limit will be the same. (I should say, I’m mostly confident in this being the case, but there’s a possibility I’m wrong.) If you call setSmartCurrentLimit(9); , you are setting the spark’s current limit to 9A. If you comment it out and re-deploy, your current limit is still 9A.\n\nIf you want a functional lack of current limits, you can set it to something dumb like 1000A. But I highly recommend against this. On 6 NEOs, your max is probably 60A, but I’d try 30A or 40A first. Too low of a current limit may result in odd behaviors popping up.\n\nIf the current limit algorithm says “whoa, you’re drawing too much current, we need to drop the voltage”, and your voltage is already low (because your current limit is set so low), then it may drop the voltage to zero. In this case, brake mode may kick in, and with 6 NEOs, brake mode is gonna stop that thing on a dime.\n\nNow, note that current limit is not the only sticky setting . Most settings are sticky. That means if you take a spark that was used on a previous robot, the settings will still be there.\n\nIn order to avoid confusion like this, I recommend calling mySpark.restoreFactoryDefaults() after initializing each spark. Then you can set all the settings for it - eg a current limit.\n\nI also recommend not doing full brake mode. Try 1 brake mode and 2 coast per side, or 2 brake and 1 coast per side; up to the driver, but I find most like the split compared to full brake mode.",

I’d stay far away from 100% loaded by disabling all devices and adding the 2 motors at a time.  If a motor controller has no power on it then the motor should be in coast and not make much resistance (pull the breaker; don’t instantiate the object for testing). Bad CAN bus connections can hurt, too, as can missing the termination resistor.",
