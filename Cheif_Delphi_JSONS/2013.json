I am familiar with it - got quite a bit and it got advantages like ou can use it to do elevators and conveyors with it and you use T nuts and such to mount things without drilling holes which is particularly handy when you design something new as if you need a mounting point a little to the left etc you just move it without turning some other aluminum into swiss cheese or using a new piece.\n\nPXL_20250523_194355213.MP 1920×1446 290 KB\n\nPXL_20250523_194355213.MP 1920×1446 290 KB\n\nPXL_20250523_194355213.MP 1920×1446 290 KB\n\nThis is the basic frame using 2040 extrusions PXL_20250527_225701601 1920×2550 296 KB PXL_20250527_225710126 1920×2550 313 KB PXL_20250527_225724393 1920×2550 297 KB To aid in assembly and improve accuracy I printed some templates that I can hold against the frame when I mount the extrusions PXL_20250527_225822776 1920×2550 502 KB PXL_20250527_230010533 1920×2550 506 KB PXL_20250527_230015968 1920×2550 362 KB\n\nPXL_20250527_225701601 1920×2550 296 KB\n\nPXL_20250527_225701601 1920×2550 296 KB\n\nPXL_20250527_225710126 1920×2550 313 KB\n\nPXL_20250527_225710126 1920×2550 313 KB\n\nPXL_20250527_225724393 1920×2550 297 KB\n\nPXL_20250527_225724393 1920×2550 297 KB\n\nPXL_20250527_225822776 1920×2550 502 KB\n\nPXL_20250527_225822776 1920×2550 502 KB\n\nPXL_20250527_230010533 1920×2550 506 KB\n\nPXL_20250527_230010533 1920×2550 506 KB\n\nPXL_20250527_230015968 1920×2550 362 KB\n\nPXL_20250527_230015968 1920×2550 362 KB\n\nHere are some views of the sphere. It is currently being disassembled as it has a little wiggle and one piece needs to be reprinted with a 1.5mm adjustment. The red part (rail) is either PETG or ABS I printed some in each see which holds up better reinforce with a bar of 304 stainless running up the middle for reinforcement. The tire (blue stuff) and most the mountings are printed from TPU - hard tpu. The infill in the tire controlls its “give” the profile has been tested on Nyland 3 carpet to have good grip but does not damage the carpet. It probably will wear quickly if you run it on asphalt like a parking lot or gravel. The reason there is a lot of TPU is as its nearly indistructible. Well you can cut it but it wont break or split.\n\nPXL_20250527_225929574 1920×2550 283 KB It is going to be driven with a 15mm wide HTD 5 belt. Unfortunately what I currently have is 2 kinds (too long or too short) so proper length will arrive on June 3rd amazon says. (I don’t have prime). I will print the gearing as I do not have the funds to buy 4 gear boxes. I will drive it with CIM ’s and I got some and some electronics donated from teams 177 and 714 and a roborio at a great price and at this time probably roll my own PDB unless someone takes it to an off season competition then that would have to be sourced (and a radio)\n\nPXL_20250527_225929574 1920×2550 283 KB\n\nPXL_20250527_225929574 1920×2550 283 KB\n\nPXL_20250527_210258451.MP 1920×2550 475 KB Partially mounted battery - still need to cut some pieces but tested the TPU battery holder for size and there will be a strap on top.  I tested the battery holder by stomping on it multipl times lol. But its >10mm TPU 100% infill in every location and I also hit it with a 4lb sledge hammer before mounting so confidence is high it will do the job. The axle holders for the ball too got the sledge hammer treatment. The aluminum did not as I know it will bend.\n\nPXL_20250527_210258451.MP 1920×2550 475 KB\n\nPXL_20250527_210258451.MP 1920×2550 475 KB\n\nThe PETG/ABS rails I fear I cannot print out of TPU - maybe if I get some real hard one. So those might get damaged if you drop the robot from  > 5 feet in my guess and it lands on one ball and the axle is in the wrong position (with the center flat) But one could bring some spares or not drop the robot from hights.\n\nThe center rails get a carriage with POM wheels and 625 bearings and excentric nuts to adjust tightness/no play just like on 3d printers like the creality or anycubic etc machines (Except the new enclosed ones) I know those wheels extrusions are strong enough when 1989 was still alive we used them multiple times for elevators and climbers.  the center rail carrige will move the “tower” back and forth to extend or retract or position in the back and it will have a multi stage 2020 based elevator in front that could hold some deployment mechanism for things like algae or balls and the back will have a climber. setup. The horizontal rails can also be used to adjust the center of “G” when climbing. But that might happen depending on parts and if someone takes it to an off season event. First it got to drive. But it would show off nicely the advantages (IMO) to use 2040 and 2020 and Tnuts and associated hardware. I also intend to maybe do a youtube video about some of the assembly.\n\nWell tomorrow I get to redesign some stuff namely the 1.5 mm error and I intend to center the ball/.wheel slightly different (so different spacer) necessitate a different template to drill some new 304 stainless pieces etc. So the thing hopefully will move in days/weeks to come.\n\nI have been asked why it takes me so long - very simple. Yes I am retired but  I help multiple teams with 3dp and stuff and so when a request comes I stop this project and do the team request - plus its self funded and I am on a fixed income (retired) so things get done when the funds are here to get the parts.",

So it should go in every direction on the spot. In contrast to omnis it has much better and accurate traction so it should do well in pushing - shoving situations\n\n2.) The balls are 6 in so should have traction like 6 in tank drive\n\n3.) it should pretty easy to clear 2 in obstacles in almost any direction like 6 in wheels only exception is at exactly a 45 to the frame so if you negotiate an obstacle to it either head on or strafing/sideways. Swerve got small wheels so is not good with obstacles. You can also install skid bars. The frame is designed with 4 in clearance and the bumpers can be mounted anywhere from about 1 in above ground to 4 in above ground (depending on rules)\n\n4.) The cost - well it depends if you print it yourself or buy it from a 3dp service. If you print it yourself you are talking about $30 in bearings and about $60 in filament and about $20 in stainless steel and about $20 in fasteners (not including the frame so about $130 for 4 wheels plus “child labor” ( FRC team mates putting it together) Now I have to admit the quoted prices are ali express and what I paid - pre trade war. So IDK what it will cost with whatever tariffs and the situation is when this is working but still it should be much much cheaper.\n\nNow the frame is about $100 in 2040 2020 extusion and hardware. sourced between ali express amazon and walmart online.\n\nI have some rl FRC ppl who issued some concerns\n\nA.) “No one knows how to work with 2040 2020 I wouldnt even know how to mount a bumper” Well you can make the frame any way you want as long as its square and legal as Xdrive config works best in square config (otherwise programming becomes more involved as there is the need to use some trig)\n\nB.) FRC don’t like 3dp so it will count as “custom” and not COTS so you got to reprint every year if you want to be legal. I content that you could upload it to any print on demand service and then it would be COTS and you can print it yourself as its legal to reproduce/print something that is COTS like the string pot and other 3dp parts that you can get from andymark or download the stl. And maybe we could get andymark to sell the stls?\n\nC.) It involves accurately drilling through 1/8 in 304 stainless and “most teams don’t know to do that as they are only used to aluminum”.\n\nD.) At this time there are no assembly instructions but if I get my way I will change that with some youtube videos.\n\nE.) A lot of ppl make a ton of $$$ selling swerve drives and support FRC so there will be some blow back.\n\nWell that are the concerns I heard so far and I try to address them to the best of my abilities. I put a lot of effort in so that every component except the 3dp parts can be made with hand tools in less than 30 minutes so it would be legal to be done off season and the 3dp parts could be cots with the 3dp service route.\n\nWell so far a lot of iterations and work. I got about 14 kg of prints so far that I rejected as either a bad idea or cause they needed some adjustments.",

Oh yeah all fasteners and bearings are metric like I got 200 625 and about 60 6806 and as I work/mdify build 3d printer stuff I got scores of m3 m4 m5 etc in all kinds of shape and sizes plus the 2020 and 2040 extrusion uses M4 and M5 bolts etc etc so the whole build is metric as it would have taken even 2x as long if I decided to wait until I have the $$$ to do it in inch based fasteners and bearings.\n\nThen I use the 3d printers and a computer is mandatory for slicing and doing all the cad etc. But one of my goals was too to make “tool count” as low as possible.

You can use T-nuts and M5 bolts so no need to drill holes which makes it easy to be accurate (just loosen and move it over a bit) 3.) you can use wheels and use it for linear motion with excentric nuts you can be as tight or loose as you want it. 4.) still not too expensive comparitavely speaking even though a complete frame in 2040 without elevators is now about $100 and probably close to 200 if you put 2 elevators on it.\n\nWhen you buy it don’t exceed 1meter length - yes you can buy it 2 M long (almost 7 feet) but shipping will kill you. I bought quite a bit before the tariffs hit.\n\nIf you plan it right you probably wont drill any holes and the outside of the frame will have no bolt heads sticking out so the bumpers will mount nice and flush and with the proper hardware its pretty easy to do 90 degree stuff as long as you can cut reasonably straight when you cut them there is a reason why they use them for 3d printers and some CNC machines as its nice and sturdy and accurate .",

And maybe we could get andymark to sell the stls?\n\nFrom the game manual,\n\nA COTS item must be a standard (i.e. not custom order) part commonly available from a VENDOR for all teams for purchase.\n\nso uploading to a print-on-demand service does not make it COTS . If Andymark or another VENDOR sold them, then they are COTS .\n\nFortunately, this is a bit of a moot point. With the new rules, the large prints (wheels, e.g.) could be used in a season even if they were printed before as long as they weren’t already part of an assembled or almost assembled drivetrain and the designs and software were public.",

How is that different if I give the STL to andymark and they print it and sell it to you? And if it is for sale from a company with a tax cert etc then how is it different than if you print it yourself? Kinda like the switch holder and other 3dp stuff on andymark or some have considered HTD 5 pulleys to fall into that category “ WCP is out of that pulley - print it” I did and then they use it for years already. Besides its a rule difficult to enforce. Like how can one tell when a part was printed and if the wear and tear is from practice or a prior years competition. And yes if it works I intend to offer it to someone like Andymark, WCP etd. Most of the part should work fine being injection molded. I don’t want to make money off the back of educational activities so I limit myself to taking donations of parts and stuff",

But all the metal parts like the axle could be done pre season as its done with hand tools (saws all and drill and template) and takes less than 30 min. I wish they would do it more like FTC where there is no set rule on what you can build when. I know many teams using a slightly modified last years bot with custom stuff etc.\n\nBut I understand they have to take care of their donors at the cost of teams budgets. One of the reasons I am doing the ball drive cause I heard too often “We really need something that works like swerve or better but that we can afford”",

That was the intent of the rule change.\n\nStraight from the blog post:\n\nWork Prior to Kickoff\n\nThe largest change we are making is re-imagining R302, regarding what work may be done before Kickoff. The rule in its current form has served us well for a long time, but in today’s program with the availability of COTS parts, the prevalence of 3D printing, and more, it was time to revisit it. The new R302 will only prohibit “MAJOR MECHANISMS” created prior to Kickoff. This should allow teams to reduce waste by re-using everything from bumper brackets to custom circuit boards to whole swerve modules, rather than needing to reproduce parts that they already have. We encourage teams to find ways to use this new flexibility to optimize their resources while maintaining the student experience of designing and constructing a new robot each season.",

I think I posted here something titled “ FRC loves to increase plastic waste in the landfills”\n\nMy philosophy is build something unique - get it to work - share it and keep using it with the necessary iterations when necessary. I know teams who have disassembled last years frame/drive train just to reassemble it the same way the next year. Time I feel could have been better spent on creating something for the current year task. As for 3dp. I print close to 100kg a year for multiple teams - they drop ship filament to me I turn it into their requests would be nice if those parts could now live for a while beyond in last years robot for those teams who build a new bot every year.\n\nI hate waste and am for reuse and recycle",
