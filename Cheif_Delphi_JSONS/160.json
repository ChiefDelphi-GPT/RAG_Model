Several folks have been working on understanding these changes, testing materials like legal and some not-yet-legal options. Assembled bumper test sections should arrive soon.\n\nHere are the ground rules for this effort:\n- Treat this like interactive build threads. I’m happy to help accommodate reasonable requests for testing variations, answering questions, and driving the discussion based on audience interest.\n- Testing and results will be spread across many posts to avoid overwhelming anyone and speed up distribution.\n- We’ll focus on core materials, acknowledging the limits of time and resources.\n- Only consider first-order effects. Solutions may apply broadly but won’t be perfect for everyone.\n- Tools are calibrated for quick testing, prioritizing efficiency over perfection.\n- Answers are generalizations, offering broad insights rather than tailored solutions.\n\nImportant posts include discussions on test setup, conventional noodle bumpers, solid noodle degradation, validation comparisons, composite foam, collision analysis, and deeper dives into bumpers and testing rounds.\n\nBug fix reminder: Processing code had issues converting grams to Newtons. Plots have been remade and reposted.",

Started at zero load\n2. Recorded once the load cell reached 1 Newton\n3. Compressed until 1332 Newtons was achieved\n4. Returned to initial position\n\nSamples were tested repeatedly to assess stability and degradation over time.

The tests revealed that both solid and hollow noodles absorb energy, with solid noodles being stiffer and absorbing more energy. Near the upper limit of displacement, both materials become \"solid,\" with stiffer springs as the force-distance slope steepens. Testing repeatedly showed that solid noodles degrade steadily due to material wear.  \n\nThe curves' starting points indicate the degree of bumper crushing, with damaged materials having less area under the curve. The biggest change occurred early, linked to cell popping in the noodles. Stay tuned for further developments.",

E.g. worse across the board.\n\nPlotting with peak load synchronized we see that the degraded noodle has taken a set on the order of 6mm based on the difference in start positions.\n\nAfter writing that out I think I understand your actual question. To answer that: it doesn’t take much load to start popping cells. Most people can grab a noodle and pop cells under very low loads.\n\nIt is not weird. The tested material is damaged, the cells certainly pop. The un-tested material right next to it is much less damaged (or not at all) and recovers more completely.\n\nThat’s because of the space left from from the counterbored bolt (that is facing down). The very center where the c’bore is does not get squished quite as much as the rest of the material.",

I look forward to seeing the results!\n\nI’ve seen some teams experimenting with using either TPU-printed corners or a corner backer made from PVC pipe cut into 3/4-inch curves. I am wondering if there are plans for testing such a setup, if that’s even doable on the device you’ve calibrated.\n\nFor the backer rods, you mentioned more permanent deformation in the hollow pool noodles. Which of the two seems to have more overall impact absorption? I hope I’m reading these graphs correctly—I’m an amateur relative to the MatSci field. Personally, I’d prefer to damage a noodle via proximity to 2056 and replace between tournaments rather than have a less-damaged bumper but it absorbs less of the impact.",
