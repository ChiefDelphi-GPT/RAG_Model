                    "cooked": "@ACrazyChipmunk and I have been putting together an Onshape integrated cloud app to make using MKCad a lot easier. It features:\n\nA search bar, allowing you to filter by type of component and by name\n\nFine grained control by the MKCad team over what parts you can see (no more scrolling through part studios whose only purpose is to become an assembly or 1000 parts making up the roboRIO)\n\nFewer clicks between you and inserting a part\n\nVery few bugs!\n\nThe last item is what we want your help with. If you’re interested in trying this out, please fill out the form here to be added to the beta tester team. Once you have been added to the team (you will get an email from Onshape notifying you), you can go to the Onshape App Store and click “Subscribe.” image 1265×676 20.8 KB Follow the steps (of course, access will always be free) to get it added.\n\nimage 1265×676 20.8 KB\n\nimage 1265×676 20.8 KB\n\nAfter that, this swanky icon: will show up on the right side of your assembly tabs here: image 1290×853 85.8 KB\n\nimage 1290×853 85.8 KB\n\nimage 1290×853 85.8 KB\n\nClicking on this will open up the MKCad window. The first time you use it, it will ask you to authorize access to your account. Click “Authorize application” as long as you trust me at least a little bit (you can always revoke this permission by going to your onshape account ).\n\nimage 526×865 33.1 KB\n\nimage 526×865 33.1 KB\n\nimage 526×865 33.1 KB\n\nNow the interface itself should appear. image 477×855 9.36 KB (You won’t see the admin button unless you’re me or Karthik for now).\n\nimage 477×855 9.36 KB\n\nimage 477×855 9.36 KB\n\nHopefully using it is pretty straightforward- click on a document name to open the accordion, then click on a part to insert it (it will always insert at the origin.) If the part is configurable, you’ll get a cute little dialog that lets you configure the part before inserting: image 398×821 29 KB\n\nimage 398×821 29 KB\n\nimage 398×821 29 KB\n\nAnd that’s basically it! So, hopefully by beta testing you’re willing to give us some feedback. You’ll actually be doing this whether you like it or not, because I’ll be monitoring the server load and any errors that show up on the backend. But it would be nice if you would talk to us as well. Specifically please let us know:\n\nAny errors or weird behaviors that show up (can’t start up the app, parts not being inserted, taking a while to load, etc).\n\nMKCad parts that you don’t see (usually this will just be because I forgot to toggle them available)\n\nThe search bar being weird (this will almost definitely happen at least once or twice)\n\nIf you run into any new issues (not currently known or you can’t work around the authorization error) please post in the thread. Please include screenshots and a clear description of what the error is or what should be changed.\n\nPlease also suggest usability changes that make it easier for you to use this app. The goal is to make it as streamlined of an experience as possible.\n\nBecause this is still under development, there may be periods of downtime while we do upgrades or when I accidentally shut down the terminal session running the server. Please be patient, the old way is still available.\n\nIf you do want to look at, contribute to, or co-opt the code, it is open source on Github . I apologize in advance.\n\nPlease give us your thoughts!\n\nCurrently known issues:\n\nSometimes browser privacy settings can frustrate the authorization system. If you can’t start it up at all, get a blank screen, endless redirects, or a browser error, first try disabling any privacy extensions (Ublock, privacy possum, etc) and/or make your browser privacy settings (specifically ones related to cookies or cross-site cookies) less strict. We are currently investigating a long-term solution to this.\n\nSome parts have broken thumbnails",

I did enable the mag encoder document, and renamed the ball shifter mag encoder mount. I did fix a few of the thumbnails manually, but that alerted me to a more serious problem with how they’re generated.  The broken images are a much more serious problem- thanks for pointing this out.",

While this is the bulk of our MKCad usage, occasionally we need to do a Derive into a PS from an MKCad part (e.g. to do some “aftermarket” modifications from COTS form, or to add/change mass parameters missing from MKCad, etc.)   I don’t know anything about how Onshape Apps are built/work, just wondering if there is any way to have the app also apply when inserting parts using a Derive?\n\nThanks for doing this, great project.\n\nMike",

While this is the bulk of our MKCad usage, occasionally we need to do a Derive into a PS from an MKCad part (e.g. to do some “aftermarket” modifications from COTS form, or to add/change mass parameters missing from MKCad, etc.) I don’t know anything about how Onshape Apps are built/work, just wondering if there is any way to have the app also apply when inserting parts using a Derive?\n\nIf there’s interest in this being a feature I can certainly work on it. I think it is possible, but involves delving through some of the undocumented portions of the API. I did originally plan for this to exist but wasn’t sure if it was important enough to be in the first release.\n\nJoe_Derrick:\n\nThe configurable extrusions do not appear to be working. They seem to insert a default sized piece (5\" for 2x1x0.1 for example) regardless of what is set in the dialogue box .\n\nJust pushed a hotfix for this. Thanks for the heads up.\n\nAlso if you filled out the form this morning, I’ve added you all in bulk as I just woke up. Let me know if you still don’t have access.",

Even branching it seems like it would be messy with 1k people eventually using it.",
