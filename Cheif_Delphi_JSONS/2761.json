Is anyone else using pathplanner + vision updating odometry and if so is the best strategy to just draw paths in the gui with a predefined starting pose? I assumed it would not work as well this year considering how precise we need to be in order to place correctly but I may be wrong. Just wanted to know how everyone is getting their autos to behave so well.",

If the robot sees apriltag at the beginning of the match, it knows the path and position it needs to go and even if you put the robot wrong, it will go there (we experienced it bitterly because we did not know that the autonomouss were flipped on the red alliance side). In addition, some teams get help from LEDs for correct positioning. In this way, they can put it in a perfect position. If the robot’s position from vision and the pathplanner starting pose are within a certain tolerance, the LEDs will light a certain pattern. So the starting position is set correctly. You probably prefer pathfindThenFollowPath() to align to a certain reef in the teleop or to go to the feeders.",

However, even if you update it periodically, if the swerve config is set properly, I don’t think there will be any drift (in a short time and I assume robot not crashed and drifted).\n\nUmar_K:\n\nI am unsure of whether vision should always update or if it should only update when standing still\n\nAnyway, the robot will constantly move in teleop. You can update it constantly while it is moving. They put some if blocks just to improve odometry. For example, measuring if it is more than 2 meters away from apriltag, measuring if there is a tag, measuring if the angular velocity is greater than 720, or tracking from more than 1 camera (these are just examples). Some teams read the apriltag position from a certain distance and drive the robot to the reef accordingly. But it is definitely better to position using global odometry. This will also ensure that the autonomy works properly.\n\nUmar_K:\n\nif odometry updates in the middle of a predefined auton will it still adjust or are the trajectories drawn before the auton starts.\n\nIf you have a certain path and your robot is far from that path, the robot will try to align and follow that path.\n\nUmar_K:\n\nI am not sure how it works as my team has only done the pathplanner basic gui drawing and has not ever used vision to update odometry\n\nIf you have a vision subsystem and you update odometry in periodic, odometry will update every 20 milliseconds even if the robot is disable. You don’t need to worry about Pathplanner.\n\nUmar_K:\n\nI forgot to mention that if odometry updates only when standing still, it will only update when intaking at the feeder station by looking at the reef april tag since the camera is at the front of the robot while the intake is at the back and the camera is too close to the april tags when placing at the reef to be able to identify them since the april tags become bigger than what the camera can see\n\nThere is nothing wrong with updating while moving. When you are aligned to the reef, even if it does not see the reef apriltag, it is not a problem (if it sees it even once while approaching, it is very likely that your global odometry will be correct).",

The reason I was worried about updating constantly was because I thought that there would be bad data coming in from the april tags because of the motion, but we already filter out anything above 4 meters away and above 0.1 ambiguity so it sounds like this was never an issue to worry about and the jitter during pathfinding must have been something else since it did not go away when we removed the vision updates",
