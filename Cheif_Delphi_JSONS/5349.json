Along with this post, all of our files and links will be available on our website soon.\n\nEvery off-season, we assign projects to complete throughout the course of the fall semester to further develop our technical skills and prepare for the season. With these projects, our main focus is teaching our students as well as our beginner and transition teams—2689 Team Alpha and FRC 2687 Team Apprentice, respectively—about design, programming, and electronics.\n\nDesign:\n\n2017 Steamworks Fuel Flywheel Shooter : This offseason project was designed to be used by future students as an example/template of a basic flywheel shooter. The shooter was initially designed to be as simple as possible. It features a simple motorized hood, and a basic 2:1 reduction for the flywheel. Ironically, but unsurprisingly, in the process of making the design as simple as possible the work became more and more complex. In the end spacing and packaging turned out to be the most time consuming part of the design.\n\nElectronics:\n\nCAN Distribution Boards using Custom PCBs : This project is an iteration of the student designed CAN Distribution Boards that were made last season. These boards serve as hubs to connect all our CAN devices and make our wiring more efficient and reliable. This new iteration uses the WAGO 2601-3104 connectors instead of the previous WAGO 250-204 connectors.\n\nProgramming Projects: (via GitHub )\n\nCrescendo 2024 Dashboard The dashboard used by Appreciate for the Crescendo season.\n\nCrescendo 2024 Dashboard The dashboard used by Appreciate for the Crescendo season.\n\nPath Tracer Logs robot positions on the field to set waypoints in Bordeaux using live locations.\n\nPath Tracer Logs robot positions on the field to set waypoints in Bordeaux using live locations.\n\nCrescendo 2024 Code Team Appreciate’s robot code for 2024 Crescendo Season.\n\nCrescendo 2024 Code Team Appreciate’s robot code for 2024 Crescendo Season.\n\nOpenMV87 OpenMV camera code as first used in the 2024 Crescendo season by Team Apprentice.\n\nOpenMV87 OpenMV camera code as first used in the 2024 Crescendo season by Team Apprentice.\n\nChapCam Tracking our autonomous paths from a camera on our shop ceiling for comparisons.\n\nChapCam Tracking our autonomous paths from a camera on our shop ceiling for comparisons.\n\n2024 Off Season Alpha Template A robot project template to potentially be used during Alpha’s 2025 season.\n\n2024 Off Season Alpha Template A robot project template to potentially be used during Alpha’s 2025 season.\n\nBordeaux Team Appreciate’s custom path planning software.

However, if you see multiple tags with your camera simultaneously, you can get precise data on your position.\n\nWe are calculating position relative to multiple tags using the sextant angle formula. Think of it like a ship’s distance to a lighthouse. If you are surrounded by lighthouses then you will have a really good idea of your latitude any longitudinal coordinate. The cool part of this is in FRC we generally don’t care about our z-height to objects on the field so this data is not wasting compute with our approach.\n\nAlso, if you can find a way to process sextant angles prior to unwarping your camera image, you can process a lot of high resolution data very very quickly from nearly as many cameras as you can fit on the robot (or maybe just one very wide angle camera ).",
