We are fully aware of the trade-offs.\n\nAnother thing we are heavily considering is using max planetary gear boxes (the people at rev as well as our mechanical mentors seem to think they are up to the task).\n\nWe are going to run 6 inch wheels. The Andymark SRs with either Neos or Falcons (we have 6 falcons, but only four are in working order, and we do not want to buy from Vex even if they were in stock).\n\nMy question is, it seems like most previous recommendations are for ~9.x:1 for fast travel or 10-11.x:1 for more torque.\n\nThe mex planetaries do not have the same specificity in gear ratio that the spur gearboxes have, so, I feel our choice is between 9 and 12:1. I cannot seem to find an updated JVN calculator, so Anyway, my questions…\n\nWith the current modern motors, do those gear ratios seem accurate for the mecanum the mecanum usage? Also, does is difference between a 10.71 ratio and a 12 significant in this usage?\n\nWith the current modern motors, do those gear ratios seem accurate for the mecanum the mecanum usage? Also, does is difference between a 10.71 ratio and a 12 significant in this usage?\n\nFor traction wheels, we were intitally going to use 4 6 inch wheels (because that is what we have always used), but are wondering, is there significant advantage between 4v5v6 traction wheels?\n\nFor traction wheels, we were intitally going to use 4 6 inch wheels (because that is what we have always used), but are wondering, is there significant advantage between 4v5v6 traction wheels?\n\nIf you were building this, for the traction wheels, would you use smoothgrip or plaction? is there an advantage?\n\nIf you were building this, for the traction wheels, would you use smoothgrip or plaction? is there an advantage?\n\nWe have run mecanum before, and are experienced with it. I am not really looking for another should we run mecanum this year conversation as I feel that has been discussed (both here and on our team) already.  To appease those concerns, we have a fall-back plan, and deadlines to implement it should things go awry.",

                    "cooked": "In 2014 we had 6\" mecanum (Because THAT was a great year to have mecanum /s).  Initially geared at 5.95:1, it was incredibly fast and very fun to drive… but while it could drift while moving forward/backward, it couldn’t strafe straight side to side.  It was geared too low and stalled out when trying to strafe.  I think we ended up at 8.45:1 that year - knowing how the game played now, we should have stuck to faster, strafing didn’t come into play at all.  That was with CIMs, NEO’s and Falcons have a little more power available to them.  I really wouldn’t want to go slower, personally.  I think you would find anything slower than 9:1 to be slower than you want, I would probably go down to 8:1.\n\nI think the advantage in the wheel sizes is speed.  You can have everything geared the same, but then when you drop the traction wheels you can go either faster or slower.  Of course, this can be done by having a reduction between the two wheels instead.  Either you want smaller traction wheels to go slower and increase torque for pushing matches, or you want faster traction for racing across the field and slower mecanum for alignment.  I think it probably depends on what your “default” setting is.\n\nPlaction.  You want as much grip as you can get in this setup, and that’s going to be with plaction over smooth grip (limiting to those two options since you did… the options for drive wheels seem endless these days!).",
