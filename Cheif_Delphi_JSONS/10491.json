I have been using planetary gearboxes for a while and got great results. sometimes so great that I felt that there was no use for conventional spur gear gearboxes in most cases. and yet, I see the top teams rarely use them and rather go of with conventional reductions. why is that? is there something I’m missing? assembly-wise, maybe they are easier to assemble? maybe there is a significant loss of power? more breaks and damage to the system? I haven’t noticed anything, hence I am asking for your help. thanks in advance!",

In applications where precision really matters such as an elevator or an arm this makes some potentially serious problems in performance.\n\nThese reasons might not be enough to justify an average team to spend the extra time to build a custom spur gearbox for a certain application, but for a super-team with a crazy amount of manpower, expertise, and resources the performance benefits of a conventional spur gearbox happen to be something they just cannot pass up.",

When you select the right gearbox for the job, COTS planetaries are extremely robust, especially MAX planetaries.\n\nCustom gearboxes can offer flexibility in shaping your gearbox to the space available in a mechanism, and offer the flexibility to have multiple outputs or shifters. This is particularly useful with mechanisms like shooters where you might want a flywheel geared much faster than your shooter wheel and the axial design of a planetary is hard to package. But, a planetary gear box is usually smaller overall than an equivalent custom spur gearbox so I think they are usually easier to package.\n\nAnother advantage I’ll note for planetaries, is that the ones from REV and VEX allow you to easily change your ratios even after a design is completed and built just by swapping out stages.\n\nAnd another advantage of custom spur gearboxes is that you can much more easily use multiple motors.",

See the last 2 photos in this post.\n\n2019 elevator also had an engageable ratchet for climbing and staying up at end of match. These types of mechanisms were more important before the simplicity of just putting a brushless motor into Brake-mode with a large enough reduction.",

There just wasn’t the width to fit a MAXPlanetary so we used some REV plates and gears to make a reduction in the space. On the other hand, the wrist and elevator had the room for a planetary and were designed that way from the beginning.",

While I’d trust a 20DP gear over a Versaplanetary, the MAX planetary is much stronger than a simple spur gear set. The gears are hard steel and the load spread amongst several of them.\n\nUsually I use a custom gearbox when I need lower ratios and better packaging. It can also be lighter than a planetary. Packaging a planetary can be really difficult in many cases, especially if you need more than 1 motor.",

The AM Sport gearboxes and REV MAXPlanetary are well-characterized by now and with no real surprises.\n\nWe use custom spur gear stages when we want to flip around mounting on something so it doesn’t stick out, or something like our 2021 robot’s conveyor system where we needed to power two rollers at almost but not quite the same speed. Actually, that demonstrated both well.\n\nWe also used a gear stage on our recent rebuilt intake to power two counterrotating rollers on our intake.

Additionally, you now have use braincells to ensure your mechanism isn’t underpowered and the motor won’t burn out (less of a concern now), I really like the simplicity of a single motor beyond fringe mechanisms like a 2020 color wheel/traversals mech. Finally, N550 + UP is still more expensive.\n\nFor one, if you’re overtaxing an intake or conveyor with a NEO 550 I’d venture your mechanism needs work to run freer.  That’s both in the context of “it’s a 200W motor, not the wimpy stuff us old-timers remember” and “we’re already making batteries scream for mercy in the modern age of drivetrains, why are you pulling amps for the memes?”.\n\nFor another thing, the price difference between a NEO 550 + UltraPlanetary and a NEO is presently $38.50*.  Make it $29 if you use/print an output pulley compatible with their FTC motion pattern instead of using the 1/2\" hex adapter.  And with more gear reduction in the UP, you can probably run a smaller pulley on the driven end–not only helping you package tighter on that end, but also probably shaving off a bit more money given how REV/ WCP /IFI price their pulleys and belts.  Even without that, $30-40 and a modicum of brain cells is peanuts in the modern FRC budget if the design benefit is there.\n\nThis is not to say that running stuff straight off a NEO is wrong–we’ve done it (or at a minimum designed it in before scrapping for other reasons) in 2020, 2022, and 2023.  But there have been just as many instances where a NEO wouldn’t package around the other rollers or gears or whatever in the system but a longer and skinnier UltraPlanetary would slot in just fine.  Ignore that potential at your own detriment.\n\n*Starter kit $45, NEO 550 $28, 1/2\" hex adapter $9.5, NEO 550 pinion $4 (well, $8 for two).  NEO $48.  And yes, REV’s price structure makes it cheaper to buy starter kits even if you yeet the HD Hex motor immediately; we found a team at our events that also ran FTC and hooked them up.  Leftover parts fit neatly in a Plano box until we need them.",

Intakes for games like 2020 definitely benefit from the power of a NEO vs a NEO550/775Pro/etc. When you need something running at a high speed and having pretty constant loading. In 2020 you were quickly intaking 5 balls every cycle, and cycles were potentially pretty quick if you were playing the close clean up role; this is just one example.\n\nI think a Neo550 w/UP can make sense for certain situations (swerve module rotation, shooter hoods, light duty rollers, etc. but for anything else it really works out to just be easier, simpler, usually cheaper, and usually lighter to just run a NEO/Falcon with a single belt stage reduction as Kremer said.",
