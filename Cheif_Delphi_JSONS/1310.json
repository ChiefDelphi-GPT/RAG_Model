As well as the additional cost for new breakers, lets say $300 total to switch over?\n\nIf you have a PDP 1.0 the switch to 2.0 gets you the slightly more aggressive breakers as well as WAGO Lever action connections instead of the PDP style. You still have CAN communication, and current/voltage/power monitoring on both.\n\nWhat are the advantages to your team to switch to the PDH ? And is there a better use of that money to buy a backup radio, motor, crimping tool, metal stock, upgrade your robot cart, buy a PIT display or programming laptop, etc…?\n\nI’m not saying you shouldn’t change - but want to make sure you thought out the “why” - there could be a compelling reason your team needs to switch!",

Mainly because we keep running into motor count limits being short by one or two motor power ports. Agreed don’t switch until you have a compelling reason though. We started on Rev MaxSwerve last year and spark maxes when Falcons stopped being easily available before Krakens were announced.\n\nWe eventually want to move all of our components to rev as much as possible as on the bot all motors and motor controllers were REV (Neos, Vortexs or Spark Max brushed motors) until we added 2 falcons. Our IMU is now the Limelight 4, instead of a pigeon 1.0 so we usually don’t have a reason to use any CTRE libs at all except the PDP . Keeping it all in REV would be nice",
