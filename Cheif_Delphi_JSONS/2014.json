Hopefully this helps us mentors and the students ensure that CAD training covers the important stuff.\n\nIf anyone has edit suggestions or additions, please let me know.\n\nNotion page\n\nText below:\n\nThis checklist outlines the skills expected of student CAD designers using Onshape for FTC and FRC . Progression through the tiers reflects increased responsibility, design complexity, and collaboration. Mastery at Tier 2 is typically sufficient for contributing to robot subsystems; Tiers 3–4 represent leadership and system-level design.\n\nTier 1: Basic Skills – “CAD Ready” Create basic parts and small assemblies, and recover from common mistakes. Core Skills Navigate Onshape’s UI, tabs, and folders Pan, zoom, and rotate in 3D space Create fully constrained 2D sketches Use basic features to create 3D shapes Understand Mate Connectors Organize and Rename sketches and features Assign material properties and colors Basic Assembly Insert parts into assemblies Insert Fasteners from Standard Content Use basic Mates connect parts Recovery & Versioning Use undo/redo Use rollback bar to troubleshoot features Understand how to suppress/delete features Understand Workspaces and Versions View and restore earlier history states\n\nTier 1: Basic Skills – “CAD Ready”\n\nCreate basic parts and small assemblies, and recover from common mistakes.\n\nCore Skills\n\nNavigate Onshape’s UI, tabs, and folders\n\nPan, zoom, and rotate in 3D space\n\nCreate fully constrained 2D sketches\n\nUse basic features to create 3D shapes\n\nUnderstand Mate Connectors\n\nOrganize and Rename sketches and features\n\nAssign material properties and colors\n\nBasic Assembly\n\nInsert parts into assemblies\n\nInsert Fasteners from Standard Content\n\nUse basic Mates connect parts\n\nRecovery & Versioning\n\nUse undo/redo\n\nUse rollback bar to troubleshoot features\n\nUnderstand how to suppress/delete features\n\nUnderstand Workspaces and Versions\n\nView and restore earlier history states\n\nTier 2: Intermediate Skills – “Design Contributor” Contribute to subsystem designs and start managing their own workspace. Part Studio Workflows Model multiple parts in a single Part Studio Derive and modify parts from other studios, documents, and versions Create and edit parts using In-Context references Advanced Sketching & Features Use mirror, pattern, project, and offset in sketches Use patterns, split part, and Boolean operations Assembly Skills Create, edit, insert, and Mate subassemblies Use Mate Connectors for precise placement Use linear/circular patterns in assemblies Insert and mate COTS parts from MKCad or the FTC Insert Tool Replicate parts Create exploded views for design analysis and robot maintenance Recovery & Versioning Create named versions before large changes Revert Main to a named version or timeline point Use version tree to identify when/where errors were introduced\n\nTier 2: Intermediate Skills – “Design Contributor”\n\nContribute to subsystem designs and start managing their own workspace.\n\nPart Studio Workflows\n\nModel multiple parts in a single Part Studio\n\nDerive and modify parts from other studios, documents, and versions\n\nCreate and edit parts using In-Context references\n\nAdvanced Sketching & Features\n\nUse mirror, pattern, project, and offset in sketches\n\nUse patterns, split part, and Boolean operations\n\nAssembly Skills\n\nCreate, edit, insert, and Mate subassemblies\n\nUse Mate Connectors for precise placement\n\nUse linear/circular patterns in assemblies\n\nInsert and mate COTS parts from MKCad or the FTC Insert Tool\n\nReplicate parts\n\nCreate exploded views for design analysis and robot maintenance\n\nRecovery & Versioning\n\nCreate named versions before large changes\n\nRevert Main to a named version or timeline point\n\nUse version tree to identify when/where errors were introduced\n\nTier 3: Advanced Skills – “Project Lead” Manage complete subsystems, and coordinate with other design groups. Design Management Create and manage top-level assemblies Use in-context edits and master sketches wisely across documents Organize parts by subsystem and naming conventions Motion and Fit Use Mate limits to restrict motion ranges Check for interference and range of motion Save Named Positions Documentation Produce 2D drawings with dimensions, callouts, and exploded views Edit part properties using the BOM panel Export parts lists for purchasing or fabrication tracking Recovery & Versioning Manage document branching during experimentation or redesign Merge or compare design branches Use workspace versions to document review milestones Identify rollback points for others during peer troubleshooting\n\nTier 3: Advanced Skills – “Project Lead”\n\nManage complete subsystems, and coordinate with other design groups.\n\nDesign Management\n\nCreate and manage top-level assemblies\n\nUse in-context edits and master sketches wisely across documents\n\nOrganize parts by subsystem and naming conventions\n\nMotion and Fit\n\nUse Mate limits to restrict motion ranges\n\nCheck for interference and range of motion\n\nSave Named Positions\n\nDocumentation\n\nProduce 2D drawings with dimensions, callouts, and exploded views\n\nEdit part properties using the BOM panel\n\nExport parts lists for purchasing or fabrication tracking\n\nRecovery & Versioning\n\nManage document branching during experimentation or redesign\n\nMerge or compare design branches\n\nUse workspace versions to document review milestones\n\nIdentify rollback points for others during peer troubleshooting\n\nTier 4: Expert / Mentor Level – “System Architect” Understand and maintain complex systems. Automation & Reuse Build reusable templates with variables and configurations Write simple custom features using FeatureScript Manage shared content libraries (MKCad, team gussets, profiles) System Integration Create and maintain Master Sketches, Packaging, and Publish Geometry Link subsystems across documents cleanly Design and manage in-context relationships with minimal error risk Drive top-level design decisions based on interdependencies Recovery & Versioning Audit entire project timelines for issues Lead version control discipline across the team Diagnose and fix broken references across documents and branches Train others on best practices for branching, merging, and recovery\n\nTier 4: Expert / Mentor Level – “System Architect”\n\nUnderstand and maintain complex systems.\n\nAutomation & Reuse\n\nBuild reusable templates with variables and configurations\n\nWrite simple custom features using FeatureScript\n\nManage shared content libraries (MKCad, team gussets, profiles)\n\nSystem Integration\n\nCreate and maintain Master Sketches, Packaging, and Publish Geometry\n\nLink subsystems across documents cleanly\n\nDesign and manage in-context relationships with minimal error risk\n\nDrive top-level design decisions based on interdependencies\n\nRecovery & Versioning\n\nAudit entire project timelines for issues\n\nLead version control discipline across the team\n\nDiagnose and fix broken references across documents and branches\n\nTrain others on best practices for branching, merging, and recovery",
