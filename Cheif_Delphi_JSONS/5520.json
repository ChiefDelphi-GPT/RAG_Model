Due to the depth of the content, it is important to reflect and identify ways to improve more efficiently.\n\nWe’ve added a page in 1A , right before the first exercise, to help guide your thought process so you can improve more efficiently and learn design faster. This self-review process is also mentioned in the verification box for each exercise. Make sure to read through the page and start adding reviews to your process.\n\nFeedback forms for the Learning Course have been updated! Each stage section (excluding Stage 0) and each stage summary now include feedback forms asking when you finished the stage (or stage section), how long it took, and any issues or points of confusion. This will allow people going through the course to report issues sooner after encountering them.\n\nThe data from how long it takes people to finish courses will also help us give better time frames and make better decisions when developing the Learning Course.\n\nThe educator’s guide has been released! If you use FRCDesign.org to train your teams, this guide can help you understand how the course is designed, how to approach training, and how to help your students learn effectively. We are always looking to improve our content; if you have any confusion when reading through the Educator’s Guide, please send us a message so we can address it.\n\nThank you @Drew_B for reaching out to us about this! We’ve been working on a simple article on FRCDesign.org that will be put on the Onshape Learning Center . This will hopefully expand the reach to more teams that don’t stay up to date with FRC Discord servers or ChiefDelphi. Stay posted!\n\nThank you for supporting us and our teams! As always, we will not let partnerships change the site’s content in any way. We try very hard to mix ecosystems to be helpful to teams of all shapes and sizes.\n\nRandom fixes: fixed several issues with the course, especially in 1C\n\n1D improvements\n\nChanged Exercise Document links so the version linked can’t be changed by us without merging a branch.\n\nPhotos now have credits if applicable\n\nNew Mechanism Examples!! Thank you Sidd ( @SilverLightning ), an alum and mentor from Team 4089, for your work on transitioning the Mechanism Examples category over to a collection only used-in-competition mechanisms, and adding several more categories than existed before.\n\nWe have several things we want to work on before kickoff. Though we aren’t planning on releasing Stage 3 before then, we plan to do several reworks and add more resources for teams to use during build season.\n\nStage 0 The current idea is to split it into two sections: “New to CAD” and “New to Onshape.” This will hopefully make it clearer for both students and educators what to run new students through based on their prior experience to keep the website useful and interesting. Someone new to CAD will do both of them, someone new to Onshape will just do that section, and someone with experience in both will skip both sections.\n\nStage 0\n\nThe current idea is to split it into two sections: “New to CAD” and “New to Onshape.” This will hopefully make it clearer for both students and educators what to run new students through based on their prior experience to keep the website useful and interesting.

The project setup may also change, but we plan on updating the CAD models to our best practices standards.\n\nStage 2:\n\nAs stated in the previous update post, the plan is to rework this stage and update it a bit to focus a little more on the subsystem workflow—making a first version, going back and changing things to reflect the design process.

We also plan to offer modified routes depending on experience. Based on current learning research, the following stage sections will also be reduced in the level of guidance, aiming to prioritize critical thinking and problem solving over following instructions.\n\nStage 1A:\n\nWe’re unsure whether this will get done before kickoff, but we are reworking Stage 1A to be more optimized and teach Onshape fundamentals relevant to FRC .

This is a big undertaking, and partially why it took a while to complete this update. Any discussion on FRCDesignLib should be held on the dedicated thread.\n\nThank you all for your support. Please remain patient with us as we work on the website and the parts library.\n\n-The FRCDesign.org Team",

We are excited to share some updates to the Origin Cube Featurescript that should make it more versatile and easier to use.\n\nSeveral improvements have been made to streamline the user experience and add new functionality:\n\nRemoved redundant pitch description from metric bolt hole size variable name\n\nReplaced separate OD variables for sprockets and gears with an OD offset variable\n\nAdded detailed descriptions for all variables and functions to improve usability\n\nExpanded the library of available origin shapes (Cube, Sphere, None)\n\nAdded scaling controls for origin shapes\n\nNew placement options: top, middle, or bottom positioning of PS origin relative to origin shapes\n\nThe updated Featurescript is available here . As always, feel free to share any feedback or report issues you encounter. Note that you should avoid updating old instances of the origin cube as references are likely to break due to a change in how the origin shape is generated.\n\nAs always, all origin cube settings are persistent so you do not need to change the settings every time the featurescript is used.\n\nThank you to everyone who provided suggestions and feedback that helped shape these improvements!",
