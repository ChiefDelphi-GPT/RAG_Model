We have been using a tracker that I made in Excel to do this.\n\nMy questions are:\n\nIs it even worth it to do this - is battery degradation that much of a problem?\n\nIs Excel the right way to do it? There has been some debate in my team about the best way to do it (mainly between Excel and just a paper sheet)",

How you do this is really up to you and what proves to be easy.\n\nDo the couple large maintenance items above and don’t worry about the um-teenth very marginal gain by plotting stuff. It doesn’t matter unless you are a 99.9th percentile team or genuinely curious. Just keep an eye on battery heath and cycle stuff out.\n\nNote: battery models new from the manufacturers are not created equal.",

Case in point some of our batteries from 2020 were only holding around 50% charge and would die immediately, meanwhile another of our 2020 batteries was literally unused.\n\nThats mostly up to how your team operates, but we have found just organizing a loop of batteries is a decent way to go, and we track which battery we used each match to ensure we fulfill the loop, or adjust accordingly should we need one of our better batteries for a crucial match.",

Also, when we got new batteries, we run a 2 minute practice session and note the battery voltage afterwards, and when practicing will keep an eye on batteries after practice runs or matches. Its not as critical as FRC where an aging battery will kill you in a match, its just an added bonus if you don’t have super high internal resistance.\n\nI never had an excel sheet to track usage for FTC because we would just cycle them out as they emptied. We also had separate batteries for testing vs practice/competition so we didn’t wear the comp batteries too much just doing basic mechanism testing. I know some teams would just buy enough batteries to have one per match during events, and mark ahead of time which ones they would use for which match, but we just cycled out 5 batteries and numbered them to keep track.\n\nI can double check, but I believe we tended to cycle out batteries every 2-3 years in FTC. If your bot isn’t super high power consumption they can easily last you a while.",
