                    "cooked": "Hey everyone! I’m the lead programmer of an FRC team going into our third season, though this is my first year on the team. When I joined, I had no experience with WPILib or Java, so our code this season was relatively simple: we had a basic autonomous program that left the starting line and placed one game piece on L1.\n\nOur code structure was organized with each subsystem having its own folder, containing the subsystem class, a constants class, and one command class. While it worked, I want to take things to the next level in both organization and functionality for the upcoming season.\n\nThis season, I have several goals for my subteam:\n\n- **Code Structure:** Organize our project in a clean, scalable way that’s easy to maintain and pass on each year.\n\n- **Autonomous:** Develop a more advanced autonomous system with multi-step routes.\n\n- **Vision - AprilTags:** Integrate AprilTags to enhance localization and accuracy.\n\n- **Vision - Intake:** Use vision to assist the intake system in detecting and tracking game pieces.\n\n- **Path Following:** Add path planning and following to enable smooth, accurate driving.\n\n- **Dashboard:** Create a real-time dashboard for drivers and programmers to monitor the robot’s status.\n\n  - **Telemetry:** Set up telemetry to send real-time data back to the team during matches.\n\n- **Pose Estimation:** Use sensors and odometry to estimate the robot’s exact position on the field.\n\n- **Simulation:** Build a simulation system so our drivers can practice before competitions.\n\nI’m excited about these challenges, but I also recognize the learning curve ahead. If anyone has experience with any of these areas, I’d love to hear about how they got started, the tools they used, key resources, or advice they wish they had received earlier.\n\nThanks in advance for any insights or assistance!",

                    "cooked": "Here’s some advice from a 4-year programmer who started in their 7th grade.\n\n**Code Structure:**  \n- Organize your project in a clean, scalable way to make it easy to maintain and hand over each year.\n\n**Autonomous Systems:**  \n- Develop a more advanced autonomous system with multi-step routing.\n\n**Path Following:**  \n- Add path planning and following to enable smooth, accurate driving.\n\n**Pathplanner:**  \n- Use Pathplanner if it works well; otherwise, Choreographer is a good alternative. Avoid using PathWever. WPIlib's trajectory following isn't recommended for first-year use.\n\n**Vision - AprilTags:**  \n- Integrate AprilTags for better localization and accuracy.\n\n**Pose Estimation:**  \n- Use sensors and odometry to estimate the robot's exact position on the field.\n\n**Dashboard:**  \n- Create a real-time dashboard for drivers and programmers to monitor the robot's status.  \n  **Telemetry:**  \n  - Set up telemetry to send real-time data back to the team during matches.\n\n**Simulation:**  \n- Build a simulation system so drivers can practice before competitions.\n\n**Tools:**  \n- For telemetry and simulation, consider using Advantage Scope (for telemetry) and Advantage Kit (for simulation).\n\n**WPILibs:**  \n- EPIC LOG is very easy to implement. [Link to documentation](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/telemetry/robot-telemetry-with-annotations.html).\n\n**Experience Over Years:**  \n- Started with time-based programming in the first year and learned WPIlib and REV. Previous experience was in LabVIEW.  \n- Second year moved to command-based, Pathplanner, and Swerve.  \n- Third year integrated Limelight and PoseEstimation.  \n- Fourth year used Pose for autonomous driving and lining up.  \n- Future plans include developing a custom pathing system with real-time obstacle avoidance, starting with PhotonVision this off-season.\n\n**Advice:**  \n- Don’t be afraid to ask questions—ask them online or in person. I did both!  \n- If you have a COMPSCI class in high school, try learning Java.  \n- Read lots of documentation and explore GitHub to see how other teams solve problems. It might seem overwhelming, but there’s a lot of useful information available.  \n\nFeel free to ask any questions! This hopefully gives you some guidance!",

However, the assistant advised focusing more on post-match analysis, logging, and debugging rather than real-time monitoring, to allow the driver to concentrate on the match. \n\nTo improve navigation and control, the assistant suggested following these steps:\n\n1. Set up an Odometry system with a PoseEstimator integrated into the drivetrain and use tools like AdvantageScope to monitor the robot's position on a map.\n2. Implement Path Following with Pathplanner, ensuring it works without vision if needed, though vision can enhance accuracy.\n3. Add vision systems to improve pose estimation, allowing parallel work on other components.\n4. Establish logging using a framework like DogLog for easy access and analysis.\n\nThese steps should provide a robust foundation for the next season without major changes to their existing structure.",

She emphasizes keeping code in Git or GitHub, as this allows for version control and access to previous versions for debugging purposes. She also recommends keeping code structure simple, with clear naming conventions and avoiding unnecessary complexity like Hungarian notation.  \n\nShlomit’s team focuses on developing advanced autonomous systems, using multi-step routing and minimizing dead reckoning to reduce reliance on luck and ensure consistency. They use PathPlanner’s auto builder with the NamedCommand System for building autonomous paths.  \n\nFor vision systems, they integrate AprilTags for localization and use PhotonVision for detecting and tracking game pieces. They prefer using affordable alternatives like the Orange Pi 5 and ArduCam over expensive solutions like Limelight, noting that PhotonVision can handle both localization and object detection. They also mention that the ArduCam has a limited field of view (FOV) of 70 degrees and plan to use different lenses to expand coverage.  \n\nAdditionally, they mention that PhotonVision can be used for localization, experimenting with PV (Photon Vision) combined with Phoenix 6’s swerve library for improved drivetrain performance. They provide code examples for configuring PathPlanner and using it alongside Phoenix 6 for smoother driving.  \n\nShlomit advises creating real-time dashboards for drivers and programmers to monitor robot status, emphasizing the importance of telemetry and LED indicators for critical information during matches. She also mentions using tools like AdvantageScope and AdvantageKit for logging and visualization, though she cautions that AdvantageKit may have a steep learning curve.  \n\nFinally, she emphasizes the value of practice fields for testing robots and discourages spending too much time on complex simulation systems, instead advocating for hands-on practice. She warns against trying to build overly complex robots early on and encourages focusing on incremental improvements and perfecting key areas over time.",
