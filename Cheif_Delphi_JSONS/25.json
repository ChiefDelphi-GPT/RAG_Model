I came in with no experience in WPILib or java, so our code this season was pretty simple: we had a basic autonomous that left the starting line and placed one game piece on L1.\n\nOur code structure was simple too: each subsystem had its own folder, which constained the subsystem class plus a constants class and one command class. It worked, but I really want to take things to the next level — both in terms of organization and functionality.\n\nHere are the goals I want to achieve with my subteam this upcoming season:\n\nCode Structure:\n\nOrganize our project in a clean, scalable way that’s easy to maintain and pass on each year.\n\nAutonomous:\n\nDevelop a more advanced autonomous system with multi-step routes.\n\nVision - AprilTags:\n\nIntegrate AprilTags to help with localization and accuracy.\n\nVision - Intake:\n\nUse vision to help the intake system detect and track game pieces.\n\nPath Following:\n\nAdd path planning and following to enable smooth, accurate driving.\n\nDashboard:\n\nCreate a real-time dashboard for drivers and programmers to monitor robot status. Telemetry:\n\nCreate a real-time dashboard for drivers and programmers to monitor robot status. Telemetry:\n\nSet up telemetry to send real-time data back to the team during matches.\n\nSet up telemetry to send real-time data back to the team during matches.\n\nPose Estimation\n\nUse sensors and odometry to estimate the robot’s exact position on the field.\n\nSimulation\n\nBuild a simulation system so our drivers can practice before competitions.\n\nI’m excited, but I also know there’s a lot to learn. If you’ve implemented any of these before, I’d love to know:\n\nHow you got started\n\nWhat libraries or tools you used\n\nWhat resources helped you the most\n\nAny advice you wish someone had given you at the start\n\nThanks in advance! Any help is super appreciated.",

                    "cooked": "Here’s some advice from a 4 year programmer. (Started in 7th)\n\nShlomit :\n\nCode Structure:\n\nOrganize our project in a clean, scalable way that’s easy to maintain and pass on each year.\n\nUse GitHub and GIT if you don’t already. Keep your comments up to date and explain everything well.\n\nShlomit :\n\nAutonomous:\n\nDevelop a more advanced autonomous system with multi-step routes.\n\nShlomit :\n\nPath Following:\n\nAdd path planning and following to enable smooth, accurate driving.\n\nPathplanner works well and is pretty easy to implement. Otherwise choreograph is a nice alternative. Don’t use path weaver. WPIlib have trajectory following but don’t recommend it for first year use.\n\nShlomit :\n\nVision - AprilTags:\n\nIntegrate AprilTags to help with localization and accuracy.\n\nShlomit :\n\nPose Estimation\n\nUse sensors and odometry to estimate the robot’s exact position on the field.\n\nDepending on time/ease of implementing/budget a good out of the box solution is Limelight 3/4. We got really good Pose with it and Megatag2\n\nShlomit :\n\nDashboard:\n\nCreate a real-time dashboard for drivers and programmers to monitor robot status. Telemetry:\n\nSet up telemetry to send real-time data back to the team during matches.\n\nElastic is a good option. Smart dashboard and Shuffleboard are deprecated. Don’t spend a month making a custom widget for Shuffleboard then find out you can use it again.\n\nShlomit :\n\nSimulation\n\nBuild a simulation system so our drivers can practice before competitions.\n\nFor telemetry and sim I recommend Advantage Scope (for telemetry) and Advantage Kit (for simulation)\n\nEdit: WPILibs EpiLOG is really simple to implement. New for 2025: Robot Telemetry with Annotations (Java Only) — FIRST Robotics Competition documentation\n\nI personally started in time based by first year and figured out WPILib and Rev. All our teams previous experience was in LABView. Second year got Comandbased, Pathplanner, and Swerve. Third year integrated Limelight and Pose. 4th year used our pose for auto driving and lining up. For the future (my 5th and 6th year) me and a new mentor are working on a custom pathing option with real time obstacle avoidance. We are trying out PhotonVision this off season.\n\nAdvice: Don’t be afraid to ask questions. Either IRL or here on CD . I sure did as you can find out lol. Try to learn Java if you have a COMPSI class at your Highschool. Biggest thing is read tons of documentation and don’t be afraid to look through GitHub to see how other teams do it. It might be overwhelming but there is a lot of good stuff I’ve found to implement.\n\nAny question and I’m here lol. Hope this helps!!",

It worked, but I really want to take things to the next level — both in terms of organization and functionality.\n\nJust want to note, a more complex structure is usually in service to some other goal, and I think in of itself is a disadvantage. Your current structure is really what I would recommend most teams stick with, and I think you can accomplish all the other goals on your list without any real major change here.\n\nShlomit :\n\nSet up telemetry to send real-time data back to the team during matches.\n\nI wouldn’t worry too much about real-time telemetry during actual matches. I want the driver looking down as little as possible during a match. I think a better focus here is would be logging and telemetry for the sake of after-match analysis, debugging issues, and dashboards for bringing up and tuning mechanisms in the shop.\n\nI’d basically go in this order:\n\nOdometry. Setup a PoseEstimator and plumb it into your drivetrain, and use AdvantageScope to view the estimated location on a map. There’s often a lot of small gotchas here, but it’s the baseline for everything else. If you can drive around in teleop and watch the little robot on the screen approximately follow in the right place you’re good.\n\nPath following: get Pathplanner integrated. You should be able to do it without vision, just don’t go too deep on trying to perfectly have your pose estimate follow the path. With named commands this also gets you multi step autos done.\n\nAdd vision. Vision simply makes your pose estimate more accurate. Anything you use the pose estimate for (path following, automation, etc) can be debugged without vision, just using odometry for your drivetrain. The benefit of this is that someone can work on vision in parallel with someone else working on 1 and 2.\n\nLogging. Get some basic logging framework setup. We personally use DogLog since it’s super simple. Just a few lines of code and a flash drive in the Rio and you can have logs that AdvantageScope can read.\n\nThose 4 things should put you in a really strong place for next season, and shouldn’t require a major deviation from your current structure.",

                    "cooked": "Shlomit :\n\nCode Structure:\n\nOrganize our project in a clean, scalable way that’s easy to maintain and pass on each year.\n\nKeep your code in git / GitHub, if you aren’t doing this then do it as soon as possible.  With this you have access to your code as long as you have a device with wifi and share it to any device that can install git. This will also allow you to use previous versions of code in case you updated your code and created a bug. Extremely useful for debugging.\n\nI would also recommend you keep your code structure as simple as possible. AKA everything has a place that it goes, naming conventions are simple, and you can easily trace back what you wrote when you haven’t seen it for 2 months. I personally avoid Hungarian notation since it makes variable names extremely long and stupid looking (but this is completely up to you).\n\nShlomit :\n\nAutonomous:\n\nDevelop a more advanced autonomous system with multi-step routes.\n\nFor autos what our team has learned is remove as much dead reckoning as possible from your routines. This will rely on way too much luck and lead to inconsistence.  (Dead reckoning is basically “move robot x meters” without a sensor telling you how far you have traveled, robots need to have data fed to them to know anything.)\n\nFor building autos we use PathPlanner’s auto builder with its NamedCommand System.\n\nShlomit :\n\nVision - AprilTags:\n\nIntegrate AprilTags to help with localization and accuracy.\n\nVision - Intake:\n\nUse vision to help the intake system detect and track game pieces.\n\nPhotonvision can take care of both of these. My team doesn’t use limelights since they are expensive. You can achieve the same thing with an Orange pi 5 and a Ardu Cam. edit: limelight 3a’s are about the same price as this so that could also be an option Limelight 3A - USB Robotic Perception\n\nWe use these: https://www.amazon.com/Orange-Pi-Frequency-Development-Android12/dp/B0BN15SS83?th=1\n\nwww.amazon.com/Arducam-Distortion-Microphones-Computer-Raspberry/dp/B096M5DKY6?crid=DPYVEFUIS3MY&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.vHt0wxrbL_agG7hlF2V_4vwOg6Ao_2EN4O4AiQ6ivvxXiOnSDVxTzEtfL8AIN_jkN8ajWim9K0KW7JaCflqLppVRnw1xd1axpOThxjgOKftAwTi3ULRQl7cYadNOQMWp2iOuu89GHq-vTn1nizjrgOfxKjoUMeutYaxfgG-YYAi2NEsbdgvSS3QMxrrJTOubR_GhE8CNZEb0Z515ecxeOJqh6V3KjtZzrvla6aYUksAe28WSoHlwMxGLl5VJey-_drnVQRDMl3sYykuuUYDZNmJ3vPID5drSM-hBm8YcNmM.ngGZi1N4389G-dTeZRex3uuNv1lR_Vry-vdjfj0kvH4&dib_tag=se&keywords=arducam&qid=1745190298&s=electronics&sprefix=arducam%2Celectronics%2C103&sr=1-4\n\nAlso a good thing to know about the arducam is its only 70 degrees FOV so we are gonna get different lenses to put onto it. https://www.amazon.com/Arducam-Raspberry-Arduino-Telephoto-Cleaning/dp/B07L92S9MT?crid=1N3IEFXQ8Z9O2&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.zhc3zBwF7XrHsM1IZgPKrO5ldYrdhWA2WEm6XOP6c1vQqX6WuDD4Kl92KR71WDij_bPEQrfPBCmb3KlGhffZpmiXmekzyMH6DmrTh2IoaqyfHFV0DsAYgc-AJEI_Q45cFGWj-ZCyGu_6jYGMW30ll12UOcMt3VUhhFl9pP2xokaLzqi9Z9kBqXdB43joAN7qLFILJk3msAl2e0VGoH17UsuNw6y9-5phxPKv2iOYronGvoheu0b1pCSdYcjli-ZfB41FAQifIh1f6w8LGCWL9YdHIASY1GijgQBm3LLU7sE.IS4yGctyHlVu-m-Ov2IlPxv4vOdN_FcooWg6Ic7POhM&dib_tag=se&keywords=arducam+lenses&qid=1745190366&s=electronics&sprefix=arducam+lense%2Celectronics%2C97&sr=1-1\n\nLocalization can also be done with PhotonVision, what we are experimenting with is using PV with Phoenix 6’s swerve library which has built in drivetrain pose correction via a api call.\n\nShlomit :\n\nPath Following:\n\nAdd path planning and following to enable smooth, accurate driving.\n\nPathplanner, there is also Choreo. But my team only uses pathplanner and its been extremly useful and easy to use. Especially if you pair it with the Phoenix 6 swerve api, makes it as simple as just adding the necessary PP methods like so (as of 2025).\n\nPathplanner also has path generating built into it, which we are experimenting with.\n\nAlso I will state this here, our team has found very smooth and accurate driving with the Phoenix 6 Swerve api. If you have TalonFXs and CANCoders on your drivetrain Tuner X has a swerve project generator that you can use as a basis for your robots and get that effective driving very easily.\n\nShlomit :\n\nDashboard:\n\nCreate a real-time dashboard for drivers and programmers to monitor robot status. Telemetry:\n\nSet up telemetry to send real-time data back to the team during matches.\n\nOur team uses Elastic as well as many others. Instead of looking to report data real time in matches, have your important information conveyed via LEDs on your robot so when your drivers are in a match their full attention can be on the robot.\n\nAdvantageScope and AdvantageKit are very good tools to use if you want to have robust logging on your robot. Bare in mind Advantage kit has its own framework you will need to learn in order to make it most effective. (and is in my opinion kind of hard to read)\n\nThis can enable you to write log files to review after your matches which can be loaded into AdvantageScope and reviewed visually.\n\nBut Elastic is a good tool to use for putting data onto a visual dashboard. There is also Shuffleboard.\n\nShlomit :\n\nSimulation\n\nBuild a simulation system so our drivers can practice before competitions.\n\nIn my honest opinion nothing can beat just getting your robot onto the field. My team has the privilege of hosting a practice field so we just put our robot onto their instead of learning / writing simulation code. So if there is a local practice field in your area I urge you to sign up to use it and get your robot on there as much as possible.\n\nAs for simulation code there are options out there but I do not have any wisdom to give on them. One that comes to mind the WPIlib simulator that comes shipped with all the other WPI game tools every year.\n\nDo not try to create that Einstein caliber robot right away. It really sucks being patient and starting off small but trust me… Me and many others have failed hard doing this. Pick a few key areas you want to improve on in the offseason and work to perfect those so you can just add it immediately to your robot during build season seamlessly.\n\nOne of my fellow coaches says it very well “Perfect is the enemy of good”. If you strive to make the perfect robot you can end up not even having a good one. The teams that are making those powerhouse robots have vast amounts of wisdom behind them and started off in the exact same place me and many other teams were. So to put it simple, that only comes with time and experience failing, over and over again and improving each year.\n\nYou would be surprised by the monumental jumps adding a few perfected improvements to your robot can make, I get shocked every year with my team with how much better our robot seems compared to the last.\n\nGive yourself more time than you would think to work on something. I’ve monumentally screwed up by vastly underestimating the amount of debugging something might take when I implement it. This has lead to me cutting so many cool things we could’ve had on our robots. NEVER and I mean NEVER expect anything to work the first time.\n\nLong read. Hope this helps :3",
