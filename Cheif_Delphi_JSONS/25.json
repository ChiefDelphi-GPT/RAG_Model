                    "cooked": "Hey everyone! I'm the lead programmer of an FRC team going into our third season, but this was my first year on the team. I came in with no experience in WPILib or Java, so our code this season was pretty simple: we had a basic autonomous that left the starting line and placed one game piece on L1.\n\nOur code structure was also simple: each subsystem had its own folder, containing the subsystem class, constants, and one command class. It worked, but I really want to take things to the next level—both in terms of organization and functionality.\n\nHere are the goals I want to achieve with my subteam this upcoming season:\n\n**Code Structure:**  \n- Organize our project in a clean, scalable way that’s easy to maintain and pass on each year.\n\n**Autonomous:**  \n- Develop a more advanced autonomous system with multi-step routes.\n\n**Vision - AprilTags:**  \n- Integrate AprilTags to help with localization and accuracy.\n\n**Vision - Intake:**  \n- Use vision to help the intake system detect and track game pieces.\n\n**Path Following:**  \n- Add path planning and following to enable smooth, accurate driving.\n\n**Dashboard:**  \n- Create a real-time dashboard for drivers and programmers to monitor robot status.  \n**Telemetry:**  \n- Set up telemetry to send real-time data back to the team during matches.\n\n**Pose Estimation**  \n- Use sensors and odometry to estimate the robot’s exact position on the field.\n\n**Simulation**  \n- Build a simulation system so our drivers can practice before competitions.\n\nI’m excited, but I also know there’s a lot to learn. If you’ve implemented any of these before, I’d love to know:\n- How you got started\n- What libraries or tools you used\n- What resources helped you the most\n- Any advice you wish someone had given you at the start\n\nThanks in advance! Any help is super appreciated!",

                    "cooked": "Here’s some advice from a 4-year programming veteran who started in their 7th grade. Organize your project in a clean, scalable way to make it easy to maintain and hand over each year. Use GitHub and Git if you aren’t already using them. Keep your comments updated and explain your code thoroughly.\n\nDevelop a more advanced autonomous system with multi-step routing. Add path planning and following to enable smooth, precise driving. Path planner works well and is relatively easy to implement. Choreography is another good option. Avoid using PathWeaver. WPI Libs’ trajectory-following functionality isn’t recommended for first-year use.\n\nIntegrate AprilTags for better localization and accuracy. Use sensors and odometry to estimate the robot’s exact position on the field. Depending on implementation ease, budget, and availability, a good out-of-the-box solution is Limelight 3/4, which gave us excellent pose estimation alongside Megatags.\n\nCreate a real-time dashboard for drivers and programmers to monitor the robot’s status. Set up telemetry to send real-time data back to the team during matches. Elastic is a good option; Smart Dashboard and Shuffleboard are deprecated. Don’t invest months into creating a custom Shuffleboard setup only to discover you could have used it again.\n\nBuild a simulation system so drivers can practice before competitions. For telemetry and simulation, consider using Advantage Scope for telemetry and Advantage Kit for simulation.\n\nEdit: WPILibs EpiLOG is straightforward to implement. A new feature for 2025 is Robot Telemetry with Annotations, available via the FIRST Robotics Competition documentation.\n\nI started with time-based systems in my first year and learned WPILib and Rev. Our previous experience was in LabVIEW. In the second year, we switched to CommandBased, PathPlanner, and Swerve. In the third year, we integrated Limelight and Pose Estimation. In the fourth year, we used our pose for autonomous driving and alignment. For years five and six, my new mentee and I are developing a custom pathing system with real-time obstacle avoidance. We’re experimenting with PhotonVision off-season.\n\nAdvice: Don’t hesitate to ask questions—whether in person or online. I asked plenty myself, either locally or on Chief Delphi. Make an effort to learn Java if your high school offers a COMPSCI class. The most crucial thing is to read extensive documentation and explore GitHub to see how other teams approach solutions. While it may seem overwhelming, there’s much to learn and adapt.\n\nFeel free to reach out if you have any questions. This hopefully gives you some guidance!",

It worked well, but I wanted to take it further in terms of organization and functionality. A more complex structure is often aimed at serving a specific purpose, and I believe your current setup is actually advantageous. It’s something I would recommend to many teams, as it allows you to achieve your goals without significant changes.  \n\nAdditionally, I wouldn’t prioritize real-time telemetry during matches. Focus instead on logging and telemetry for post-match analysis, debugging, and dashboarding to help tune and refine systems. Here’s how I’d approach this:  \n\nStart with **odometry**: set up a PoseEstimator and integrate it into your drivetrain. Use AdvantageScope to monitor the robot’s estimated location on a map. This is the foundation for everything else. If you can test in teleop and see the robot follow the correct path, you’re on track.  \n\nNext, implement **path following**. Integrate the PathPlanner without relying solely on vision. Named commands can handle multi-step automations even without perfect positioning.  \n\nAdd **vision** later. While it improves accuracy, your system can still function effectively without it. This allows you to work on vision independently from drivetrain improvements.  \n\nFinally, establish **logging**. A simple framework like DogLog works well. Just plug it into the Rio and store logs for analysis.  \n\nThese steps will put you in a strong position for the upcoming season without overcomplicating your structure.",

                    "cooked": "Organizing our project in a clean, scalable way that’s easy to maintain and pass on each year is essential for long-term success. Keeping code in Git or GitHub ensures accessibility and allows for version control, enabling us to revert to previous versions if updates introduce bugs. This is particularly useful for debugging. Additionally, maintaining a straightforward code structure with clear naming conventions simplifies tracing code history and makes collaboration easier.\n\nFor autonomous systems, removing as much dead reckoning as possible reduces reliance on luck and ensures consistency. Dead reckoning, which involves moving robots without precise distance feedback, can lead to inaccuracies. We use PathPlanner’s auto builder with its NamedCommand System for building autonomous routines.\n\nFor vision systems, integrating AprilTags enhances localization and accuracy. Vision can also assist the intake system in detecting and tracking game pieces. PhotonVision can handle both tasks and offers cost-effective alternatives to expensive solutions like Limelight 3A. We recommend using an Orange Pi 5 combined with an ArduCam for this purpose. Additionally, note that ArduCam has a limited 70-degree field of view, so we plan to use different lenses to address this limitation.\n\nUsing PhotonVision, we’re experimenting with combining it with Phoenix 6’s swerve library for improved performance. Our current setup includes implementing a Kalman filter to integrate vision measurements effectively.\n\nPathPlanner and Choreo are valuable tools for path planning and following, especially when paired with Phoenix 6’s swerve API. Configuring PathPlanner involves setting up suppliers for pose, resetting odometry, and defining drivetrain behaviors. Our implementation leverages PID constants for smooth navigation.\n\nWe also use Phoenix 6’s swerve API for precise driving. Additionally, we’re exploring path generation capabilities within PathPlanner. For drivetrain tuning, having TalonFXs and CANCoder modules is beneficial, as Tuner X provides a swerve project generator to streamline development.\n\nMonitoring robot status in real-time is crucial, which is why we use tools like Elastic and Shuffleboard for creating dashboards. These tools help visualize data and provide alerts, allowing drivers and programmers to focus on the task at hand. However, we prefer displaying critical information on the robot itself using LEDs for quick reference during matches.\n\nFor logging and analysis, we use AdvantageScope and AdvantageKit, though they require some learning curve. Logging data post-match helps identify areas for improvement. While these tools are powerful, they can be complex to master.\n\nBuilding a simulation environment is another investment in team success. While nothing replaces actual practice on a field, simulations can complement preparation. If available, utilizing local practice fields maximizes hands-on experience. Although simulation software exists, we find WPIlib’s simulator, included with annual FRC tools, to be reliable.\n\nReflecting on past experiences, starting small and focusing on key improvements each season is key. Striving for perfection can hinder progress, as incremental gains often yield significant results. Perfecting specific aspects of the robot early leads to smoother transitions during competition seasons.\n\nPatience and persistence are vital. Underestimating the complexity of a task can lead to costly delays, so allocate ample time for troubleshooting. Remember, functional robots rarely work perfectly on the first attempt.\n\nIn summary, focus on scalability, embrace iteration, leverage modern tools, and prioritize clear communication to build a robust, competitive robot.",
