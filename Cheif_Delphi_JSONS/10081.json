                    "cooked": "What I’m talking about here is a drop in solution that uses probabilistic localisation techniques and multiple sensor fusion that you can throw on your robot, plug in a network cable and it just spits out the current coordinates and pose of your robot to network tables based on the current years game field layout.\n\nI know there are many things out there that do part of this process, like WPILib odometry with sensor measurements updates, we have limelights or photvision to detect targets.  ML technologies exist for detecting various field objects.\n\nI suppose what I’m looking for is what the limelight did years ago for vision targets.  Before the limelight existed, we all setup a camera, with a green ring light, wrote your own vision processing code, and hoped that it worked at the event.  Then the limelight came out, and we had a reasonably priced, drop in solution that basically gave you exactly what you needed to reliably detect a vision target. How many people still run reflective vision pipelines on their RIO now that limelight exist?\n\nI feel accurate localisation that updates as the game progresses is at the same point now, we need a product that you can drop on the robot, plug in as many cameras as you want, go through some camera alignment setup process, plug in ultrasonic or laser distance measuring devices, give it an IP address so that it can talk to network tables, and put a some lines of code in your drive subsystem that dump your swerve module state info onto network tables so the black box can consume it.\n\nThen have this magic black box, consume all this data, does its target detection, April tag detection, field element detection from Machine learning and give back perfect localisation values so that products like Pathplanner can accurately following paths at any points in the match.\n\nMaybe even a system where the on robot video footage and associated odometry values from of hundreds of robots playing in early season matches could be uploaded to some server somewhere in the cloud and some magic Machine learning engine could continuously be updating to give better results. Then before you compete you download the latest ML engine to the black box.\n\nIsn’t this what Tesla does with its self driving stuff. Footage from cars all over the world is constantly being supplied back to Tesla so that the image recognition of signs, roadside feature etc is being continuously improved.\n\nSome sort of system where, the video footage with odometry values could be post processed on some cloud server. A system where, based on the embedded odometry values and say having a camera placed in the centre of the robot at 45 degrees to left with height of 1 metre, the image in the camera should be ABC.  Then train the engine to give back these coordinate when this image is seen.  You could only use early match footage before odometry errors grew, but I feel if a system where people contributed there on robot footage for even just the first 15 seconds, a ML could be developed that related every possible pose on the field to an expected image that you would see from a camera at that location.\n\nSurely there is a PHD in this for some university student out there that is a coding mentor for an FRC team.\n\nI wish I was 40 years younger and had the mental capacity to develop such a solution.  I know I’m not the person to develop this but I’m sure there is a person/team out there that is capable of building such a black box.  I’m sure it could be very profitable as well.",

Given the high likelihood that there will be multiple Apriltags on the field, and that they will be located in “useful” places; I suggest that a “black box” system which fuses IMU, and possibly odometry, with known position reset based on vision targets is the next logical step forward.  Such things are happening at the highest levels of FRC, appliance-ing them would be a huge leap forward for a great many teams.  the potential to “zero” your pose errors 2 or more times per cycle would be incredible.\n\nthen, depending on the game, the ability to detect and auto acquire game pieces (think balls randomly located on the floor of the field) would, I think, be more valuable than incremental improvements in positioning accuracy by ML (until the game arrives that needs sub-centimeter positioning accuracy, anyway!).\n\nCombine those with the already demonstrated (by a few teams) ability to “shoot on the move” and you are very close to robots that can play autonomously for the entire match.   And from there, probably not that far from robots that can autonomously beat human driven robots.",

                    "cooked": "Ignoring the constant overpromising from a self aggrandizing hype man… The problems facing Tesla for FSD are drastically different than the problems facing you for localization in FRC .\n\nThe first big difference is in precision - Tesla really doesn’t have to be that precise. Side to side a Tesla Model 3 is ~6’ wide and lanes in the US are between 9 and 15 feet wide. If they are off by a few inches it doesn’t matter. (Model X is still just about 6\" wider than the 3…)  Compare this to FRC where a few inches is the difference between hitting your target and hitting a wall.\n\nThe second is the type of environment they operate in - Tesla has to build a map and localize at the same time, in FRC you don’t need to do this. If you are localizing off of landmarks (be they known features on the field or april tags) they are within some tolerance of accurate. It’s a simpler problem.\n\ngerthworm:\n\nIdentifying where you are at relative to the apriltag is an order of magnitude harder.\n\nEh, maybe. But it is largely a solved problem. The real trick is in compensating for the noise in all systems and getting more accurate predictions.\n\ngerthworm:\n\nThe ML infrastructure describe is several orders of magnitude harder.\n\nEh, transfer learning into YoloV8 or YoloNAS isn’t too hard these days, you can do it in Collab pretty reasonably. Deploying ML models is a bit harder but PyTorch has a post about how to get 30FPS performance on a stock rpi 4.\n\nnstrike:\n\nWhat you’re describing is eerily similar to a Zed + a jetson but it is so cost prohibitive it has almost no team support.\n\nhttps://www.stereolabs.com/zed-2/\n\nMarshall can correct me - but there’s some issues with getting reasonable performance out of the Zed.\n\nPersonally I’ve had decent luck with the Luxonis OAK-D cameras. In my simulations using one I can get passable precision on pose estimation but the reality is that the locations of the tags is bad for localization purposes. If I was trying to localize on the 2023 FRC field I’d likely want my ML system to also spit out a few landmarks aside from the April Tags. Either that or I need multiple cameras and my simulation tools can’t currently support that (it’s on my todo list)\n\nMoving out of sim into the real world is on my todo list, I’m also experimenting with quality of results I can get out of monocular cameras as that’s far easier to use for most people (and markedly cheaper)\n\nLocalization is a hard problem. If HQ wants to see us do it we need either tags everywhere or visually distinct landmarks at the very least. They also need to make it worthwhile. Right now most teams don’t need it - they can use wheel odom and it’s fine.\n\nHaving improved simulation capabilities would also be great - bonus if they can output video streams and whatever vision tools can operate on them. This was actually a space I was working on but I haven’t been able to get adequate performance even on my fairly beefy computer. (Strong hunch it’s something I’m doing) and I also just feel really unenthusiastic about writing against the WPILib socket interface given the documentation for it seems to be increasingly harder to find and idk the level of support for it. (Also, bluntly, the lack of ROI on building this stuff out…) I think building out simulation and test infrastructure is beyond most teams.\n\n(Note, without the secondary camera feed I can get comfortable real time performance even with more complex models)",

The real trick is in compensating for the noise in all systems and getting more accurate predictions.\n\nAgree “a solution exists”, but it requires thinking about roughly 10x the things you have to for a naive “turn toward reflective tape”.\n\nAndrew_Schreiber:\n\nEh, transfer learning into YoloV8 or YoloNAS isn’t too hard these days, you can do it in Collab pretty reasonably.\n\nTrue, but I’m referring to the solution OP indicated, where there was also automated collection/training of data observed on the field.\n\nTo be clear: My thesis is not that “There’s no way to do what OP describes” - there is, absolutely. Where I’m coming from is I don’t see this as a great startup opportunity - the technical cost to deploy and maintain the solution as described will outpace what teams are willing to pay for the solution.\n\nThe best path to execution is likely with limelight, and to build upon the ML platform they started but haven’t fully fleshed out yet. Otherwise, you’re rebuilding large chunks of their hardware infrastructure from scratch.",

You do need NVIDIA hardware though.\n\nIt’s not great in low light. Not an issue with most FRC , but it cannot handle low light at all. Dark colors and reflective/transparent surfaces like the side walls of the field will also be hard to find. This is an issue of all vision based localization unless it’s aided by additional distance measuring as well. Smartphones even use this to help auto detect focus distance and better control your regular camera.\n\nIt will not run without a Nvidia CUDA gpu. Even the cheapest Jetson has this, but it’s about all 1 Jetson nano can handle on it’s own with a desktop OS running as well. The zed software is a processing/ram hog and when you have 2 or 4gb you’re really limited. Again in FRC not so bad, you don’t really need to run much more on it.\n\nIn ROS there are nodes for localization from laser, vision, Imu and Encoder feedback. All methods are fused together to get a combined Odom in the world space. That can then be used in the Navigation stack to drive the robot autonomously or give you an accurate position during teleop. Marshall and Zebracorns probably can speak to this better but that is a digital black box… Once it’s configured properly. Configuring ROS, teaching students how to use Ubuntu and it’s build tools is the difficult part",

With a handful of labelled data augmenting it should be fairly automatable though. There’s also some efforts that can be made in simulation here. It ain’t easy though.\n\ngerthworm:\n\nTo be clear: My thesis is not that “There’s no way to do what OP describes” - there is, absolutely. Where I’m coming from is I don’t see this as a great startup opportunity - the technical cost to deploy and maintain the solution as described will outpace what teams are willing to pay for the solution.\n\nI’m not as certain. While Nvidia + Zedd may be a solution it certainly isn’t the only one. The primary constraint that has existed the last few years has been the chip shortage - it is difficult to design and produce a product if you can’t find reliable sources of chips. Or even build an open source solution if you can’t expect users to reliably source hardware.\n\ngerthworm:\n\nThe best path to execution is likely with limelight, and to build upon the ML platform they started but haven’t fully fleshed out yet. Otherwise, you’re rebuilding large chunks of their hardware infrastructure from scratch.\n\nI mean, why should external parties support LL efforts? They are a closed source privately owned solution. I have no beef with them but I learned long ago don’t work for free and strongly encourage people not to as well.",

I had to go ask where the docs were, but the protocol spec is here:\n\nallwpilib/simulation/halsim_ws_core/doc/hardware_ws_api.md at main · wpilibsuite/allwpilib · GitHub\n\nYeah, there was until about 2 years ago, a link to those in some of the simulation documentation. Since it had disappeared I got real nervous about building against a spec that may be being deprecated.\n\ncalcmogul:\n\nAt this point, all the user has to do is map the measurement sources and voltage sinks to a physics model (the framework side can’t know their robot design). One way we could make it easier is adding physics sim to all our examples, so users can modify a working setup.\n\nSo, I did a lot of digging into wpilib sim over the summer and found it to be somewhat challenging when I put on my “I’ve a basic understanding of physics and math” hat (which, ok isn’t hard given my long history of being publicly bad at math). Examples would certainly help.\n\nWarning, this is going to get WAY outside the topic at hand but simulation is somewhat linked soooo.\n\nConstructing it, fairly simple, I found most of it to be fairly straightforward. I probably would have found a builder pattern to be somewhat more intuitive rather than remembering argument order, but with decent IDE support in a well typed language this isn’t a huge issue and it does keep errors from not initializing things happening at compile time which is a real nice thing.\n\nThis is where I start to have issues. The function signature for setState is completely opaque and requires an understanding state space which I know a lot of students don’t have.\n\nIf you wanted me to propose a solution to make this more clear - build a simple wrapper as a static method on simulation class. SingleJointedArmSim.buildInitialState(double initAngle, double initVel) which reduces having to remember what the state vector looks like.\n\nBut the big piece I find missing in simulation isn’t just the mechanism and physics side, it’s the visual side. It’s hard for me to output an mjpg stream of what a camera located at some point on the robot would see. In part because specifying the transform chain gets real hard. ROS has a lot of tooling built around this, and I’m very sad that the FRC Gazebo efforts seem to have gone nowhere.",

Since it had disappeared I got real nervous about building against a spec that may be being deprecated.\n\nIt’s stable and we have no plans to deprecate it, although we’ve switched the XRP to use a UDP protocol instead due to the processing constraints there.  I’m not sure why the link disappeared from the simulation docs, it’s definitely still our recommended approach for connecting outside applications into HAL simulation.\n\nAndrew_Schreiber:\n\nI’m very sad that the FRC Gazebo efforts seem to have gone nowhere.\n\nThe biggest issue with Gazebo is that they’ve promised Windows support for a decade and it’s never materialized.
