Any tips on charging, labeling, or organizing them so it’s not a mess and conduct with them during completion? Also any advice on wire management?",

As for crimping we started going with minimum length wires(6gauge)  this year instead of stock lengths or extra lengths. We have a hydraulic crimper four the terminals and Anderson connector. As far as before loading them into the bot or unload there are lots of other posts on battery etiquette, generally you want to grab by the edges or the grooved lip on top. We may be switching to a new pit box for battery’s that cad lead designed but unsure as of now. not sure if you’ll be the battery person in pits (depends on coaches choice).\n\nAs for general wiring we’ll go over that in person with pre season stuff, look into higher level teams wiring systems look as new motors and old ones, ask coach to buy the specific torque wrenches ctre sells for krakens or learn how to use our current one.  We won’t likely be using and rev motors or controllers however we will use there PDH because of programming reliability and such. Look at the difference in twisted wiring and learn what ohm difference is for twisted and non twisted 22gauge, learn what’s best. We always twist CAN and usually use 22gauge green and yellow I believe. Look into all sorts of CAN termination and 120ohm resistors for termination if we ever decide to use them. I would say look at high teams electronics placement and learn what the programmers would want for the limelight mounting and positioning (more cad side but still learn it) learn the pneumatics hub and how it works as well as the VRMs docs.\n\n(Yes I know we’re both part of 3218 and yes I purposely didn’t use names)",

I’ve been an EE for too many decades already and I just don’t get a device that tells me that every battery I take off the charger has a 130% state of charge. Some people swear by the thing.

That is\n\nSlow (think 60-90 minutes), and\n\nOf debatable relevance when they’ll see 150+ amp peak draws on the field.  (Put another way, you don’t practice like you play.)\n\n1293 got one back in 2022 and we tested religiously for years, but we haven’t set up our CBA in the new shop yet.  If you do test with a CBA, I recommend writing the resulting capacity and date right on the side of the battery with a Sharpie.  That way you have all the records right in the relevant spot.\n\nAs for other battery markings, we do two:\n\nA year code on the bottom side (we use 2025A, 2025B, 2025C, etc to tell multiple batteries apart)\n\nA name on the top.  You assemble it, you get to name it.  We’ve had everything from Turbo to Minecraft Tutorial Video Circa 2013 to The Snack Zone.  We usually put the battery name on the match schedule so there’s no uncertainty over “Did we switch the battery?”.",

I have been asked to check on teams where their robot was cutting out on the field at competitions. I discovered their battery was down to around 11V. The last time they had charged their battery was at their school.\n\nSomething  not obvious is to check forwearon the contacts in the SB connector on the robot before your competitions. The contacts in the connectors on the batteries should be checked once a year.\n\nThe contacts will have to be popped out using a small screwdriver. If there is any copper visible, the contacts should be replaced. The area that gets worn is not visible while it is installed in the plastic shell. The worn contacts have a higher contact resistance than ones in good condition and can make it more likely that your robot will brown out.\n\nThe contacts in the SB connector in the robot will get more wear than the contacts in the connectors installed on the batteries.",

                    "cooked": "Some tips:\n\nAssign one person to be in charge of battery shepherding. If you get multiple people trying to manage the batteries, you are likely to get some fumbles. Give this role a cool title (Battery Czar, Power Keeper, Amp-man, etc.).\n\nWhen the robot returns from a match, the used battery needs to be recharged but depending on how many batteries you have vs chargers, there may not be an open charging slot immediately available. Therefore, you will probably have a quarantine area for batteries that need charging. If the team reports that the battery performance was poor during the match, consider removing that battery from the rotation until it can be tested.\n\nWhen using a beak, you need to let the batteries cool down after charging before testing to get an accurate test result. This means you need a cool down quarantine area for batteries that are done being charged but have not been tested yet.\n\nWhen you test your batteries, write down the result in a tracking spreadsheet. It can be hand written, or on a computer. Make sure that the test result (in terms of state of charge and internal resistance) is consistent with the previous tests for that battery. If the battery charge or health deviates from the previous readings, consider removing that battery from the match rotation until you have a chance to diagnose the problem (note that the problem could be due to user error when it was plugged in for charging, or potentially that the battery was not fully charged when it was removed from the charger and you may be able to return the battery to the rotation after some additional charging).\n\nAfter the batteries have been tested, if they are deemed to be fully charged and fully healthy, they are ready for a match. So you may want an area to keep these match-ready batteries so that the drive team can grab and go if they are in a scramble to get in queue for a match.\n\nYou will likely have some “practice batteries” that are a few years old and not as healthy as your newer batteries (in terms of internal resistance, etc.) but are fine for practice. Since the team will want to go to the practice field often to fix all the stuff that isn’t working, you will probably want to have another area for practice batteries.\n\nMake sure your charger is visible from outside the pit area and has some sort of indicator (light) on it to indicate that the power to the chargers is on. That way you can quickly glance at it to make sure that no one has accidentally unplugged the charger (or forgotten to plug it in in the first place). Make sure that the indicator is large enough and bright enough that even the mentors can see it from outside the pit area.\n\nAssuming that the power in the pits is switched off at night, take the batteries back to the hotel with you after the end of each day. It is nice to have a portable charging station that can be easily rolled out of the pits and fits nicely in the car and is able to carry at least a few batteries. Charge enough batteries over night to be ready for your early matches the next day. You don’t need to charge all your batteries, but you want to have a few that are ready to go. Make sure that you remember to plug the charging station in when you get back to the pits the next morning (see point #7 ).\n\nSince you will have so many designated areas where batteries might be located in your pit, see point #1 .\n\nMake sure that your battery shepherd gets acknowledged for a job well done when celebrating your competition result as a team. This is an extremely important job that rarely gets the recognition it deserves. And if the shepherd doesn’t feel appreciated, then the work will likely suffer. But, on the other hand, if it is treated as the valuable job that it actually is, then the person doing it will likely do an excellent job.",

For us, the math is we need 8 batteries to get through a worst-case playoff bracket with 6 amp chargers.\n\nAdd an extra battery as your emergency battery. This should get labelled, bright color tape over the connector (or other system so it cannot be inadvertently used), charged fully at start of quals/playoffs and lives in the cart. The ONLY purpose is for an unplanned battery change fieldside, when you or an alliance partner have a bad or unknown battery. Ideally, it should not be used at all.\n\nEspecially at 4-team competitions, your alliance partners and their batteries are a resource too. If you’re the captain, manage that as well as needed. Having a quality 3rd pick who can simply take that off your shoulders is a great way to load shed, especially if they are not playing as much.",

They also have good prices on SB-50 housings (remember they’re color-coded so you want red), wire , Powerpole connectors if that’s your jam, SB-120 products if you’re going for fat wire (we haven’t yet, but valid!), and so on. AndyMark also has a heap of the same , if that’s easier to buy from.  I forget if we’re using their lug connectors or another supplier’s; they’re all awful similar.\n\nAndyMark also has a heap of the same , if that’s easier to buy from.

                    "cooked": "i dunno.  if your match score is power- or energy-limited, I can see this being an impactful thing, but most teams are limited by other factors.  the limiting factors do depend a lot on the game design – 2025 was a low-energy, high-precision game, so batteries weren’t that big a deal, but 2023 and 2024 were high-energy games where battery limitations were the frontier for many teams.\n\nnote: nothing magic happens at the spec temperature: if you’re willing to risk venting and degrade battery longevity, you can raise the temperature beyond the maximum, and get even more output.  it’s just chemistry.  so if you need the extra, there’s definitely an incentive to “make a mistake” with your battery heaters.\n\nwe’ve ruminated on battery-heating setups for the pit, and decided it wasn’t worth the trouble. to get the inside of the (big heavy metal) battery to the target temperature, without raising the outside beyond that temperature, would take a really long soak with a low-temperature heater (think: regulated hospital heating pad), so you’d need to do it for days in advance, and in the hotel at night.  but I dunno, if 2026 is a high-energy game, maybe we’ll do it.",

Given the price point, Harbor Freight’s (oft-unjustified) reputation for quality, and the fact that we chopped off the alligator clips to put on an SB-50 ourselves, I would test a new-to-me battery tester on a few different batteries of known condition and see what that one reads.  Might be 10V, might be something else.\n\n(We did have a few batteries that would test right on 10V before a match.  We usually kept those in reserve and would try another battery, though with hindsight the power move would’ve been to use them in midday matches to leave the hot sauce for the end of the day.  If the difference even mattered that much for us.)",
