I imagine even with a super pit, there would have to be a overflow set of tools that stay home? what then do you tell the students, start with the competition pit box and then move on to overflow if you don’t find it/it is being used?\n\nThanks!",

Organize both sets of tools so they can easily be used in their own environment. At the build space you need a giant wrench drawer with dividers for 10 of each of common sizes and odd sizes stored separately and out of the way. Figure out your common tools and make them very easy to find and put away. A 10-32 needs a bright green wrench from the bright green box in the top drawer of the big tool chest etc. We tried multiple small duplicate tool boxes so we wouldn’t get traffic jams at the big tool chest. Don’t do it. You end up having to mark every tool with its box, and sorting tools back to the correct boxes takes a bunch of extra time. If you assign a tool box to an area or group of students, you end up with one box not being used while some other group has run out of a size of wrenches and 4 people are watching 1 guy use the 3/8”. If you don’t assign tool boxes, you just end up with multiple places to look for a single tool.\n\nFor most teams, what you do in the pit and what you do at the buildspace are different activities requiring different tools and different parts. In the pit we often need 3 sets of a couple sizes of wrenches and rarely do much of any fabrication. The pit tool box is tailored to this and is very rigidly organized so we know exactly where everything is. If we tried to duplicate the pit tool box at home we would need 3 or 4 tool boxes to hold all the common wrench sizes but that would only be enough to hold 1/3 of our tape measures, we’d only have enough 1/4” and #7 drill bits for one box but most of our other bits wouldn’t fit in the toolboxes, the squares, pry bars, hand saws, and router bits wouldn’t have anywhere to go, only the most common sizes of hex key would have a place for the T-handles (we rely on L keys for anything but 10-32 or 1/4-20 in the pit), and most tools would not fit in their cutouts because they are random brands and the pit has cutouts shaped to one specific tool.\n\nKeep the pit separate so you can keep it organized and stocked. If it’s in general use at the buildspace people will put its tools in the buildspace tool boxes, and use its nuts and bolts when they someone else has the main box of that fastener. Then when you need to pack for a competition you have to restock everything. If the pit is not to be used during at build space you only have restock the couple parts that get used at competition.",

It ensures all students know exactly where everything is no matter where they are. It holds a lot of stuff we probably wouldn’t take to competition if we had to pack several smaller toolboxes.\n\npaulonis:\n\nUse/create more than one of whatever you take to competitions.\n\nI agree with this for your large team. To help keep things in the appropriate “pit”, you could try to color code each set with colored tape or some kind of easy to see label. The last thing you want is for all your 3/8\" sockets to end up all in 1 pit. (Because, of course you would bring the other pit to the event and not have any)\n\nYou could make a “red pit” and a “blue pit”. Split your tools into 2 sets and color accordingly. When you put your tools away, you’ll know which pit to put them in. If you see a wrench colored red in a drawer of the “blue pit” you will know to go put it in the other pit.",

We specifically keep our pit tools separate from the rest of our tools so we don’t go to a competition without something we need.  The only items that are used at home that travel are things like our Milwaukee tools (drills, riveter, vibe saw, vacuum, etc.), powerpole crimper, and tap and die sets.  For everything else we try to keep duplicates to use at home so we aren’t pillaging the pit tool box or supplies very often.\n\nWe will sometimes work out of the pit in our shop for a few days before a competition to get used to where things are and will be so workflow makes the transition from one workspace to another smoothly. But you really have to police things going back where they belong.",
