Was this stiffening, and in the ways you did so, a “given” from the start of the design process?\n\nAdditionally, why was the elevator stiffened in the way that it was? I see plates with bent flanges, tie rods, cross braces, and maybe more… Is this all drawing from a team/public best practices document? Other robots you’ve seen? Other?\n\n971 continues to be one of the few teams that you can reliably count on making a unique robot and executing with it at the very highest levels. Huge props on the continued success.

                    "cooked": "Here are some of my thoughts on your questions, though there might be some parts I don’t know perfectly. Suction: We experimented with end effector designs for a really long time at the beginning of the season, and then had a group evaluate the designs. At the beginning of the season we were still very committed to the idea of a human player intake. Our proposed method at the time for human intake with suction (which wasnt really the best) was to add a roll joint and to roll the coral down horizontally onto two suction cups. We didn’t really like the idea of a horizonal rolldown intake and were trying to minimize DOFs and not use a roll joint. The funnel design we picked originally didn’t need a wrist, which is why we preferred it over suction. It was also very reliable for algae, and had a partial ground intake capability. We then realized that it would be better to have a wrist after all but didn’t revisit the idea of suction.\n\nElevator: After kickoff we originally designed the robot with a stock greyt elevator. At that point we only had two small stiffening rods that extended to midway up the base tube, along with the gusset plates at the bottom. After some driving, we realized it should be stiffer, so we made stiffening rods longer, partially inspired by orbit. For champs, we rebuilt the elevator, originally focusing on a lightweight design. However, after building that elevator we realized that it was flimsy to a degree that it was unusable. At that point, we did everything we could to make it stiffer, since champs was coming up. We just added whatever we could come up with in order to solve the problem. We made the top of the elevator base thicker and bulkier, and reduced some of the lightening on the verticals. We added those U shaped constraining plates (Chad support in CAD), and made a few other changes as well. We were just trying everything we could So, it was a bit of a rocky road and a compilation of pretty much everything that came to mind in order to make the elevator stiffer. Overall, it was simply really hard to design a good elevator since the arm assembly weighed a lot.",

However, we had issues with sticking the aluminum tread part to the carbon tube. Carbon was also harder to machine. We made a set of carbon tubes, but as our robot sits right now, we only have aluminum ones on because the carbon ones just fell out of commission, especially as we made changes to our elevator stiffening architecture. It wasn’t really a major decision to use/not use carbon tubes.",

                    "cooked": "Hi! I do the PCBs for our team, and I might be giving a Spartan Series talk soon on our PCB design process. But in case that doesn’t happen, here’s a quick rundown of how we approach it.\n\nWe use KiCad for all our projects. The first step is defining what the board needs to do and how big it can be. If the board needs to interface with another PCB, like the Spartan Board does with the roboRIO, that helps determine the size and shape early on.\n\nNext is the schematic. This is usually where the most time goes, especially when working with complex power systems or integrated circuits. We spend a lot of time making sure the design works under edge cases like reverse voltage, input ranges from 6 to 18 volts, ESD events, and current spikes. We usually organize our schematics using a hierarchical structure to keep things clean.\n\nWhen assigning components, we look for ones with more robust specs than we strictly need. Sometimes we’ll choose a part that’s slightly worse in performance if it has native KiCad footprints and 3D models, since importing or creating those can be a hassle.\n\nFor PCB layout, we usually start with the board outline, place connectors, and then move on to other components. We reference datasheets for layout recommendations, especially for power supply routing, but we also double-check them since they sometimes contain errors. We focus on keeping power traces as short and direct as possible and use copper pours for ground and sometimes for power. For sensitive signals, we pay close attention to impedance control and length matching.\n\nOnce layout is complete, we send the board out to JLCPCB or PCBWay for fabrication. Components are usually sourced from Digi-Key or Mouser. When the boards arrive, we pick and place the components ourselves and reflow them.\n\nMost boards work on the first try with only minor issues, which we fix in future revisions by following the same process.\n\nIf you’re interested, the Spartan Board V2.0 design files are open-source and available on our GitHub. Let me know if you have more specific questions. I’m happy to help.",

Thought it was like 1323’s with a stop, but then when watching a match video I saw it went though! That is absolutely genius! You already have the centering from the claw design so why not use it! Such a cool concept! How did you end up at this solution? What prototypes and other ideas did you explore?",

                    "cooked": "The end effector design was chosen pre-ventura, and we thought we could get a good bit of ground intaking functionality out of it. We added a lexan spike as well in between the end effector wheels as well so the coral had something to sit on. The reality was that it could only really ground intake coral in one specific orientation(when coral was perpendicular to the bumper). If the coral was too angled or off to the side the end effector wheels would just spin/knock it away.\n\nWe started working on adding a seperate ground intake pre-CVR. During this time we also modified a couple subsystems with improvements to L4 scoring position, shifting the  closer to pivot point, and lightening a ton to give us the weight budget to fit a ground intake(Although we did end up overlightening). We built a entirely new second robot with these modificatons and landed with a ~8 pound weight budget for the ground intake if I remember correctly.\n\nWhen we decided to pursue a ground intake, we knew we didn’t have the time or resources to prototype a full ground intake like those that OP, Orbit, and Citrus had. The idea was that all we needed was a roller with spiked wheels on top of the end effector when it went into ground intaking position to prevent the coral from being spun out/knocked away by the end effector wheels. However this top roller did not lift the coral enough for the end effector spike to catch it, and we ended up not adding the ground intake on for CVR as it wasn’t in a good enough state.\n\nA group of student stayed behind from CVR to continue working on the ground intake and landed on a two roller solution. They developed this prototype on our V1 robot that we built for Ventura and it worked well. However, when transferring it over to the new robot that we had built for CVR the same design that had worked in the prototype wasn’t really working as well(wasn’t ever a definitive answer as to why from what I remember). They were quite a few issues : dead spots within the intake, the coral getting jammed on the lexan plate that we were using as a ramp into the end effector, getting jammed in the rollers etc. At this point, we were throwing everything we could at the ground intake to get it working. 2 nights or so before champs during a very late night at the lab we decided to throw on the spiked roller again paired with a bottom roller and while it was still kinda jank it worked better than any prototype we had earlier. Took it to drive practice the day after for a couple hours and then the robot was put on the truck to Houston.\n\nIt took us pretty much most of quals at Champs to get the ground intake working consistently, although it worked pretty well during Champs elims(just wouldn’t work if coral entered through the far sides and occasionally got jammed).\n\nTLDR we attempted an organized effort an adding a ground intake with the weight budget we had, ended up resorting to throwing ideas around until one of them worked very very late into the season. In retrospect, we probably would have started prototyping a citrus/orbit style intake from the get go.\n\nI’ll try and find some prototyping videos and add them to this thread, might also be some pictures on our webiste",
