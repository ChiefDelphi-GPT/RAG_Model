We are looking to move to using everything Versa since our program currently doesn’t have precision machining tools (and I’m not entirely sure when we’ll be able to get them yet) and having a pre-drilled system seems to be the best way to go for us currently. Thank you in advance for your responses!",

(Hypothetical because we don’t know next year’s kit.)  Sometimes 4\" wheels are a bit on the small side for field elements, you’ll still need to shell out for a gearbox, etc etc etc.\n\nI also don’t think I’d lock myself into the VEX ecosystem right now.  They have some great things, AndyMark has some great things (I prefer their gussets), REV has some great things (MAX Planetary is a delight), Thrifty Bot has some great things (the Megaplate offers stuff even the gearbox vendors aren’t selling), and that’s just what’s out now.\n\nAndyMark sent an email blast today saying they’ll be showing off new and in-development products at their Championship booth, REV was on Facebook teasing an April reveal (and really, when else in April would you choose?), CTRE showed off a prototype of the Talon FX controller the year before the Falcon 500 came out, so on so forth.  And between AM/REV/VEX, all of them can be useful in a build technique where you match-drill with a hand drill.  We did most of our Championship rebuild that way.\n\nIf you have money that must be spent before the end of the fiscal year, that’s one thing–but I’d still wait for May to make an informed decision.\n\nFull disclosure: I used to work for AndyMark, and The Thrifty Bot has sponsored parts for my team this year.",

Especially if you plan to have one in the next year or so, as the transition is fairly easy from that to a traditional WCD.\n\nIIRC the Vex drive in a day chassis gives you…ballshifters (which take about 10 minutes with a cordless drill to make function in the AM kit chassis). And they’re frankly obsolete, as well as that entire chassis.\n\nThere isn’t really a “being locked into one ecosystem” in FRC , at least at the moment. Everything runs on 1.125\" hex bearings, 0.5\" hex, two 6 hole patterns, and CIM , 550, and 775 series motor mounting holes. I’d advise against standardizing on one manufacturer’s system, though the desire is understandable, especially given the annoyances of your location.",

We debated many options including manually milling the rails, shopping it out to local machine shops, doing a laser cut delrin parallel plate drive, and finally settled on just buying and overnighting 3x of the Drive in a Day to cut our losses. We avoided the AM kit chassis because we felt the design of the Drive in a Day allowed us to more closely replicate our then current WCD as well as offer more standardized mounting patterns. We did do things a bit differently and use the DIAD rails to build a pseudo-WCD, and used custom delrin and Markforged flipped gearboxes. All together we went from no drivetrains and a broken router to 3 finished drivetrains in about 3 or 4 days. If it suited our needs, we would not hesitate to do this again.\n\nimage 3024×4032 2.56 MB\n\nimage 3024×4032 2.56 MB\n\nimage 3024×4032 2.56 MB",

The latter has 10 holes every inch (closer on the ends), 1/4” holes every two inches on the inside plate, and plenty of configurations for drivetrain itself.\n\nI’d ask the same question if the Drive in a Day was in the kit and the AM14U wasn’t—the thrust is that I don’t get the appeal of flipping from the KoP drive base kit to another drive base kit that doesn’t bring a massive obvious benefit on the field. Doubly so for a team with limited fabrication ability.",

It is tempting, but 4 inch wheels are a bit small.\n\nWe used 5\" wheels this year, I’m not sure 6\" would fit in our specific implementation, but I could be wrong.\n\nBillfred:\n\nI’d ask the same question if the Drive in a Day was in the kit and the AM14U wasn’t—the thrust is that I don’t get the appeal of flipping from the KoP drive base kit to another drive base kit that doesn’t bring a massive obvious benefit on the field. Doubly so for a team with limited fabrication ability.\n\nWe felt that by building the DiaD in a non-standard psuedo-WCD configuration, it suited our needs well. I have nothing against the AM14U and think its a great starting point. This just fit our needs a little more closely and also at the time we ordered, we had the ability to get VP orders processed faster than AM order due to the school purchasing system. We also liked that we could tap many of the holes in the DiaD to 10-32 or drill out to .201 to have a clearance fit. In the end it was a spur of the moment decision, driven by unforeseen router breakdown, but it did work out quite well for us. I don’t think the DiaD is a no-brainer answer for teams with limited manufacturing capability as we still had to cut a lot of custom parts to interface with it, including custom gearboxes.\n\nNick.kremer:\n\nWe used it in 2018 and I wasn’t impressed. We had to make custom billet extension pieces to get the chassis length we needed and mounting things generally to the chassis was a pain. I’m fully willing to admit that was because we had 0 experience mounting anything to a not 2x1 tube chassis, but the experience left a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nWe chose the DiaD because we knew it was large enough to accommodate everything we needed. In fact at 27\" long its 3\" longer than what we were originally planning for. I’m still sad we didn’t fully realize the tiny 24\" x 24\" robot we were originally planning for. I fully agree that if you need something longer, it’s not a good option and should be passed over.",
