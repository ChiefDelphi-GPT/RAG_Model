Sometimes though the code takes a long time to run and your code may run once every 0.04 seconds or longer depending on the code that is running . What this error tells you is that each periodic cycle takes more than 0.02 seconds.\n\nThere are 2 main causes for this.\n\nYou are running a lot of code. In this case you just have a lot of things for the Rio to process and it is not able to keep up at a speed of 0.02 seconds. As long as this isn’t too drastic (for example if it takes 0.2 seconds per code cycle that is a problem) this should not be to big of a problem, other than maybe the robot feeling a tiny bit sluggish in its actions.\n\nYou are running a lot of code.

For example one function taking 0.3 seconds will cause problems because the code will wait for it to finish and not continue running while the function is running. There are many reasons this can happen. One example is that applying configurations to ctre motors now waits for a response from the motor. The time it takes for the motor to respond can be long and will stop your code.\n\nThere is one part of your code that is taking a really long time.

The time it takes for the motor to respond can be long and will stop your code.\n\nSo how do we determine which option this is? The main thing we want to look for is whether there are specific functions that take an unreasonable amount of time and how long each code cycle is. To do this try the link @nstrike sent. It will show you how long each function takes. Try to look for one that take significantly longer than the rest. If you find one try to find out why it takes so long and change it so that it will be shorter. If you do not find one check how long each code cycle takes. If it is consistently a relatively small number (say less than 0.05) this should be fine. If not you may want t find ways to make your code more efficient.\n\nHope this helps, and can help more if you need it.",

If one of these functions is too slow, it will simply delay everything else.\n\nTo expand on my earlier message, it’s fairly common to see a couple of these messages when the robot first starts running or changes mode because you often have one-off setup work to do like loading autos and generating paths.  If they continue, then you will get control lag, whereby your commands aren’t being run often enough.\n\nWe can tell a lot more if you post your DS logs and share your code.",
