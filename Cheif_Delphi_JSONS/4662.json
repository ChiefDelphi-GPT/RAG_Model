                    "cooked": "Last year, my team used a custom swerve drive approach that allowed us to use motion magic on the drive motors. This allowed us to minimize the jerk of the robot and allowed it to come to a controlled stop as frequently the robot would become unsteady and lift up slightly from the back when rapidly decelerating because of the arm’s position.\n\nThis year, my team is using the new phoenix6 swerve drive api as this is the first year it is supported in python. We were looking through the documentation and could only find motion magic control for the steering motors, but not the drive motors. Would it be possible to do motion magic on the drive motors with the phoenix6 swerve drive api or would another approach be needed like changing the pid profile on the fly to minimize jerk?\n\nAlso, when performing some preliminary testing using the example template from phoenix6, we found that the drive motors were unable to hold their velocity set point. The steering motors were able to resist external forces and hold their set point, but the drive motors could easily be moved from moving the wheels even though the velocity set point was 0. When increasing the p gain significantly, up to 0.4, the drive motors started to try to hold their set point, but it would result in large amounts of oscillation. Could there be something wrong in the code or would this require better tuning of the pid gains?",

From what I have read, I understand that using position control might be faster as it is unprofiled but it could result in overshooting if not tuned accurately. Using motion magic expo would help prevent overshooting but might not be as fast as position control.\n\nThe reverse is actually often true, Motion Magic® Expo is faster at reaching the setpoint. However, there are some situations where Position control behaves better.\n\nMotion Magic® Expo behaves better in situations such as switching from driving straight forward to straight to the right. The profile is the fastest possible motion to get to the new angle.\n\nOn the other hand, Position behaves better in situations where the module target angle is constantly changing, such as driving straight while rotating in FieldCentric control. In that case, the steer motors need to maintain a roughly constant velocity along with the changing setpoint, which Position can account for but Motion Magic® Expo cannot.\n\nBecause the case of driving while rotating in FieldCentric control is so common, and poor tracking in that case results in a little bit of translational drift, we decided to default to Position control. But you can switch it if you prefer the tracking of Motion Magic® Expo, which behaves better in most other cases.\n\njayticku:\n\nAlso, when looking at closed loop output types for the steering and driving motors, would you recommend voltage or torque current foc control?\n\nTorqueCurrentFOC (requires Phoenix Pro) can make tuning easier, especially for velocity control with drive motors. We have an explanation of some of the advantages here: Closed-Loop Overview .",

Commutation runs much much faster than anything in user control, so that does not impact the performance of closed-loop with TorqueCurrentFOC.\n\njayticku:\n\nit is recommend by some people to use TorqueCurrentFOC on things like elevators if you want constant force as it allows you to prevent damage from when a motor moves to a hard stop.\n\nThis is resolved by a stator current limit in general, but since TorqueCurrentFOC controls torque directly, you can set the peak forward/reverse torque current to a lower value to prevent damage. The other advantage is that the units are a bit cleaner, as amperes are always directly proportional to Newton-meters (torque).\n\njayticku:\n\nDo you know if there has been any tests done comparing voltage to torque control and if one performs better than the other in position or velocity control?\n\nTheoretically, Voltage with FOC enabled and TorqueCurrentFOC have very similar control response, with the one big difference being that TorqueCurrentFOC eliminates the back EMF term. That back EMF term implicitly behaves as a (continuous-time) kD term in position PID , or kP in velocity PID . That is also why you need a kV in voltage control, and it’s why things like voltage kA need to be discretized and can be difficult to determine manually.\n\nThere are a few super lightweight mechanisms, particularly with slower PID controllers, where the optimal velocity kP is practically 0. In those cases, voltage control may behave better. However, for most other mechanisms TorqueCurrentFOC should behave just as well if not better.\n\nThere are a lot of factors that can impact back EMF, which TorqueCurrentFOC automatically handles for you. Acceleration being constant for a constant torque current output makes the math overall cleaner. And removing the implicit back EMF terms from position kD and velocity kP can give you greater control over the system, although it does mean that kD is mandatory in PositionTorqueCurrentFOC (which is also the case with optimal voltage gains).",

TorqueCurrentFOC and voltage with FOC enabled, which is what we have currently and what is enabled by default, should behave similarly with some edge cases such as mechanisms with p values near 0 behaving better with voltage control. However, based off of the testing we have already done, this is not the case for our robot. TorqueCurrentFOC should behave similarly or better than voltage with FOC control for position and velocity control with the added advantage being that tuning the gains will be a bit easier as certain gains such as kV are not needed anymore.",
