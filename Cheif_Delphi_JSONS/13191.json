Constant force springs have various benefits: no reliance on battery performance (excluding release mechanisms), small size, and repeatable/consistent motion.\n\nRegarding the point above (conforce springs’ use with cables), this can cause issues when the extended spring is able to twist.  This is more likely when the extended spring is poorly supported or when there is significant friction in the system.  Including a backer to the extended spring (or running it in a track) is great when possible.\n\nI’m not very familiar with conventions for FIRST robot design, but I’m happy to answer any technical questions about conforce springs!\n\nHave a good day!",

With this game and the solution concept being explored in this thread, the spring would be used to power one direction of linear motion on a rotating arm, meaning the force on the mechanism the spring is pulling on due to gravity will be changing, as will the weight of the mechanism itself as it picks up and puts down game pieces.\n\nI think it could be implemented to work, but a motor powered solution in this particular case might be a little more reliable given the dynamic situation.\n\nAlex_Y:\n\nConstant force springs provide much less power for extending the arm.\n\nDepends on the motor and its gearing, and the CF spring chosen.  These springs can be quite strong if needed - but in most FRC use cases, we use them as counterbalance or for extension where a motor needs to power retraction, so the motor needs to be more powerful.",

I have just two ideas to offer:\n\nA varying load shouldn’t be a concern for the spring in and of itself, as long as the loading remains below the spring force.  It’s worth considering inertia here also (over and above the nominal weights involved).  To your point, a motor-driven mechanism could yield more consistent motion depending on the application.\n\nThis may already be standard practice in FIRST, but it’s worth noting that conforce springs can be interwound to multiply force.  In interwinding, multiple identical springs are layered together and mounted on the same drum.  A quantity of (3) springs with 5 lbf force each will exert ~15 lbf when combined in this way.  (Be careful with this operation!  Ensure you’re protected against cuts and flying springs!)  Interwinding can be finicky, so be sure to test well!\n\nThanks again for the insights!  Best of luck with the competition!",
