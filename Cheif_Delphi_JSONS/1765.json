                    "cooked": "An FRC robot isn’t a mechanical assembly. It’s not electronics or code.\n\nIt’s not drivers, scouters, or strategy.\n\nAn FRC robot is in the combination of all those things. They are inseparable. For an example: you can walk in the pits, look at a robot, and have a pretty good idea of how that team was thinking about game strategy just by the design.\n\nAs such, I’ve lately found it useful to think in terms of “Robot Essence”.\n\nGame-sense Game-sense is the way you imagine the game, and the robots on the field. Game sense is the rules in the manual and the CAN list. It is the tangible feel of the game. That game piece in your hands. Past experience. How robots drive around in space, bounce off one another. Put one way, it’s the collision between physical reality and the rules in your mind.\n\nGame-sense Game-sense is the way you imagine the game, and the robots on the field.

Put one way, it’s the collision between physical reality and the rules in your mind.\n\nStrategy How do you win a match with your alliance? What strategies are there? What is within your means? What can a third robot do? What can a drive base do? This is a well-trodden path in FRC . In particular, it is very hard to stay off of Karthik’s turf, but I try to take a different angle where I can.\n\nStrategy How do you win a match with your alliance? What strategies are there? What is within your means? What can a third robot do? What can a drive base do? This is a well-trodden path in FRC . In particular, it is very hard to stay off of Karthik’s turf, but I try to take a different angle where I can.\n\nDesign I am talking about more than just mechanical design here. I emphasize that entering the season with a controllable drivebase and a practiced driver means that you are already a player in this game. Then I briefly introduce what I refer to as the four main FRC mechanisms.  Talk about integrating them as black boxes, and then ways to iterate more effectively.\n\nDesign I am talking about more than just mechanical design here.

This is about prototypes, rapid robots (alpha-bots). Ways to support your own personal ideation process, and work with ideas as a team. The final section is titled “Where Words End”, trying to hit as close as I can to the nexus of idea generation.\n\nIdeation Ideation interacts with every single one of the previous categories—again these are all inseperable from one another. This is about prototypes, rapid robots (alpha-bots). Ways to support your own personal ideation process, and work with ideas as a team. The final section is titled “Where Words End”, trying to hit as close as I can to the nexus of idea generation.\n\nWith this presentation, I hope to establish a big picture view of designing a robot to play a game. And, if I’m lucky, capture some things that are known, but difficult to put into language.\n\nSEE THE PRESENTATION NOTES\n\nLinks Found on the Slide they are Used\n\n…\n\nKarthik, Effective FIRST strategies\n\nJonathan Norris, “Cycling Optimization”\n\n610 2013 Einstein Cycling\n\nWildstang 2025 Build Blog, Controls\n\n1678 2016, FRC Dark Secrets\n\nRobonauts “getting away with it”\n\nMarie Curie on the Beauty of Science\n\nAlbert Einstein on Imagination\n\nThe Beatles, Yellow Submarine Iterations\n\nJohn Lennon, “All You Need Is Love”\n\nRichard Feynman Interview\n\nGeorge Gershwin Prelude Analysis\n\n“How To Defend A Salad”\n\n321 2024 Einstein Defense\n\n2073 2019 Curie Defense\n\n125, 2017 Feeder\n\n1114 Simbot Sideswipe Intake Day 3 Prototype\n\n1986 2017 Shooter\n\n254 2018 Elevator\n\n254 2025 Alphabot\n\n1241 Week 1 Wooden Robot\n\n971 2023 ARM\n\n254 2019 Robot Image, Sketch\n\n1983 2015 Robot Sketch\n\n973 (RAMP) 2011 Double Joint Robot Concept\n\nGrant Sanderson Reading Interview (3Blue1Brown)\n\n4481 2025 Build Blog Tele-op Cycling Analysis\n\n3100 2025 “The Algae Bot”\n\n2363, 2024 Amp Specialist\n\nJohn Cage on Silence\n\n2024 Game Reveal Video\n\nCrayon CAD\n\nNo clue.\n\nThis presentation is new to me, so I want to see if it survives scrutiny. I also want to give it before humans before putting anything online. I will do the trial run with the team in early December.\n\nSo: Not anytime soon, likely after the season. If I do, I want to make a series of small videos rather than one long presentation.\n\nSort of. I’m the same person covering a lot of similar material so there’s a relation to “The Fake Book” . And it is convenient that they are in different forms. But, by and large I personally prefer the way this presentation moves.\n\nI have been involved with FRC for loosely ~14 years. I got my start in fifth grade following my oldest sibling around—just observing, hunting down tools, being a wrench monkey. I am not a trained engineer, but have mentored team 3926 beginning with the 2024 Crescendo season (favorite game of all time btw)\n\nEDIT: Forget to mention, I am looking for more robot napkin sketches to include in addition to my own. If you have any or can point me towards some I would appreciate it.",
