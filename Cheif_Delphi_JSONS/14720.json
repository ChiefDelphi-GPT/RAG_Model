Intake actuation falls into the sweet spot for pneumatic cylinders.\n\nIt has just two positions.\n\nFast motion between two hardstops.\n\nCushioned compliance, so when the intake is smashed into a wall at full speed, the intake can collapse without breaking anything.\n\nBut, as a thought experiment, let’s consider a simple alternative.  One concept which might work and retain some of the desirable properties of a pneumatically actuated intake would be to use a very stiff spring to hold the intake out against a mechanical hardstop.  That retains the spring cushioned compliance.  Something like a gas spring strut would probably work great for this. Then, when you want to retract, pull it back in with a fast rope winch.  Maybe with a limit switch to kill the power when it’s retracted.  Depending on how fast you want to deploy, you could just run the winch in reverse.  Or if you wanted super fast deployment, use the winch to pull the intake back into a latch.  Unspool the winch during a few spare seconds of time, then release the latch when you want the intake to deploy.\n\nSeems simpler to just use pneumatics, though.",

You would also design this much like a pneumatic cylinder aswell.\n\nAnother option is a motor with a high reduction to actuate it up and down for this you get a highly variable and repeatable motion with the only downside being that it takes up a PDP slot. For examples of these I would look at the 2016 game as there were a lot of short small intake like arms to cover the various defenses that needed to be traversed.",

This would be true if you had a single arm intake (see 118, 148, 179, 1690) or a 4-bar linkage type mechanism (see 125, 1678,  3476, 3940). The movement of this arm can be accomplished with a motor instead of pneumatics (I believe most, if not all of the examples I cited above use pneumatics but the key takeaway is that the system operates by rotating an arm through a small angle).\n\nHere are some tips:\n\nYou will want to have a decent gear reduction from your motor to your gearbox output shaft to create enough torque to move that arm while at the same time slowing down the rotation of the motor enough to have a controllable (but not too slow) arm movement.\n\nUsing either a large gear or a large sprocket attached to the arm allow you to transfer a large amount of torque to the arm with a large bolt circle attaching the gear or sprocket to the arm so that you don’t have excessive loads at any one bolt (you can see examples of a chain and sprocket driven arm actuation on some of the roto-climbers).\n\nDesign the system with a hard stop so that you are not holding the intake at a high back-load position by stalling the motor unless you are very comfortable that you are not going to release the magic smoke.\n\nMake sure that you remove power from the motor when the intake is at the stop to also avoid another possible cause of magic smoke escape.",

This year, we added a home-made friction clutch to it (sprocket with a 13.75mm bore squeezed between two shaft collars, using an acetal spacer as a “spring” with a bolt in the end that could be tightened or loosened).  The clutch does a couple things:\n\nIt makes the PID loop easier (using a REV Through-bore encoder on the intake shaft, not the built in encoder on the motor), as we can manage the friction so the intake would droop down if it was raised too far.\n\nIt allows for some flexibility in the intake, so the ball can push the intake up a bit as it comes in over the frame\n\nIt lets the intake push in without damage when we run into a wall, and “spring” right back out thanks to the PID loop.\n\nWith a speed of ~24RPM, and a necessary rotation of less than 30 degrees to get to our setpoint, it means we can get there in half a second or less.",

Picture below probably doesn’t help much, but it’s the only one I have showing it (and I won’t be back in the shop until Monday - spring break).\n\nimage 828×400 68.9 KB\n\nimage 828×400 68.9 KB\n\nimage 828×400 68.9 KB\n\nThe stack-up looks like this:\n\nBosch seat motor on the inside of our 1/2\" polycarb side\n\nAndyMark hex shaft adapter , with the retaining screw in the back – Added groove for an e-clip, located just on the inside of the polycarb (so the retaining screw/washer isn’t taking the force of the friction) – turned down to 13.75 mm (aka thunderhex) outside diameter\n\ntwo bearings, one pressed in from each side of the polycarb (we may have an appropriately sized spacer in here for added structure, I can’t remember)\n\nthin spacer to ensure we’re rubbing on the inner race only\n\nmetal shaft collar (not tightened)\n\nsprocket, with the inside bored out to 13.75-ish mm (aiming for a slip fit without slop… more of a feel thing with the shaft than an actual measurement)\n\nanother metal shaft collar (not tightened)\n\nAcetal spacer to get us a little past the end of the shaft\n\nBolt and washer, with loctite\n\nTypically this sort of thing would have a spring in it, but we didn’t have any on hand and found that by adjusting the tightness of the bolt we could make an adjustment to how strong the clutch was.  We tightened it up to the point where it would slip down to where we wanted it and called it good.  So the spacer provides the “spring”, and the two metal shaft collars provide the friction (aluminum on aluminum).  The force of everything is going against the two bearings, so we don’t worry about stripping out or damaging the motor.",

We also increased to a ~60:1 reduction in the ultraplanetary stack, with an additional 1.25:1 reduction using larger pulleys after the gearbox.\n\nAs pictured, I believe our reduction was ~30:1 in the UP stack and 1:1 pulley to pulley. It worked to get the intake in and out, but definitely had some hesitation while retracting. I can snag a better picture of the updated mechanism at our meeting tomorrow if wanted.",

Never found the added complexity worth it.\n\nFor actuating an intake with a motor -\n\ndesign it to be able to be folded into the robot if it’s smashed against a wall\n\ncareful using worm gear motors (seat, window, etc) because you can break the worm gear if the intake moves during an impact\n\nyou don’t really need PID if it’s just 2 positions. Use a timed action to Move at 1 speed for x seconds and then at 0.1 speed for the rest of the time between 2 hard stops. The 0.1 holds it in place either in or out of the robot. Use a motor that can take being stalled at low power for the whole match. We usually use bag motors on a 100:1 VP for this, but other motors will work, too. (see the locked rotor testing on vexpro’s website. Don’t use a 775 pro.)\n\nyou can use belts, chain, or linkages to transfer rotation. linkages are easiest to deal with if you have access to fairly accurate machining capabilities",
