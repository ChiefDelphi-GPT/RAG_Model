                    "cooked": "So, this is a long love-hate story with limelight. since we grew up, my team and I have been trying to use spotlights, and we developed several codes for it. After our Crescendo regional season, I created an auto-aiming code on the speaker in our robot, using TX reading and alignment with PID controllers. After a while, we disassembled the season’s robot and had assembled a new Swerve base. After trying to implement that code I had made months ago, nothing worked. I had to redo it from scratch, and my simple logic from before seemed to no longer work. After a few days, I managed to create another code and everything worked. When I arrived at Reescape, my team didn’t finish the robot with a deadline to test the code extensively. However, I installed LL and tried using the code I had remade, and nothing worked. After the tournaments, I redid the alignment code again based on Kully’s, and again it worked. Now, after building a test robot for a team challenge, my programming honestly doesn’t work. I’m tired of everything that made this happen and I would like to know if this is normal or not? In general, the only thing I change in these codes is the YAGSL swerve configuration and things like changing the library year, but even so, the camera never works like before!",

Today the robot simply didn’t respond to commands, even though I was following the dashboard and seeing that the reading was correct. It only worked when I went back to the robot code we developed (I had downloaded the old code and changed the Swerve configuration), and pasted the alignment code exactly the same as it was not working in my git. When testing last year after trying to reuse the same code with the same Swerve with the same settings, the robot didn’t respect the PID , and it only worked when creating other controllers to replace the ones I used (the values ​​were the same). So my problem doesn’t seem to be with the code writing and it’s not that big, but it worries me a lot that things don’t work as they should just because Limelight was removed for a while or similar things.",
