                    "cooked": "Hello, so my team is using two CAN Spark Max for our elevator, a primary and a secondary, the secondarty is set to follow the primary so we just control the primary, we use the built-in PID Controller (ClosedLoop) to control our elevator, it had been working just fine the whole year but it started not working and showing a weird behaviour.\n\nSo the elevator reaches the set point the first time but then immediatly it “shuts down” and the elevator starts going down because the PID is not getting “powerd on” in some way like it used to, and if I try to do the same action again, the PID Controler seems to reset because the set point changes and each time its lower and lower until the point the elevator starts going against the chassis.\n\nI tried a quick solution in inverting the primary and secondary and for some reason this work, it might probably be an issue with the controller itself but I can’t seem to find any other releate issues yet and I would like to see if I can save this controller or I need to change it completly.",

                    "cooked": "I don’t have time at the moment to dive very deep in the code, but at quick glance, it looks like you’re running the elevator with just a P controller (I/D set to zero), and no feed-forward component.  If this is accurate, I’d be surprised if this worked fine since February, unless something about the code changed recently.\n\nEssentially, when the elevator moves up, it fights gravity, so maintaining a position requires a non-zero amount of motor power.  With a simple proportional controller, the motor output will decrease proportionally to the distance from your desired position, eventually reaching a point where it doesn’t have enough power to go up anymore, but has yet to reach the goal.  This is generally called “steady-state error”.\n\nA common approach is to just increase P until it gets to your target, but that still won’t work right.  Remember, it’s proportional, so reaching your goal should mean zero motor output.  Also, if you happen to overpower the motor (P too high), you could overshoot your target, and cause it to start driving the motor downward, and with the help of gravity it can be be rather aggressive.\n\nYou may consider adding an I (integral) term, which acts on the buildup of error over time, and you may even get it to work well.  The downside of this is something called “integral windup”, and it can be VERY aggressive and unsafe if not handled carefully.\n\nA better approach is to add a FF (feed forward) term.  This is just a constant extra bit added to the end of the PID calculation, meaning the motor is always outputting something even when error is zero. Sounds familiar, right?  If done correctly, FF alone should be able to get the elevator to have “neutral buoyancy”, meaning wherever you move it to, it stays.  Then the P controller only needs to act on the change from its current position and can effectively ignore gravity.\n\nApologies, that was a bit longer than intended, especially if my initial assumptions about the cause are incorrect.  Hopefully it’s useful to someone though.",

Althought the main issue I see here is that I know and understand how it seems that it should not work, but the reality is that it worked and at least was working for all this time until yesterday when I am doing some PID alignment test and trying to move the elevator when I discovered this issue, I did some more testing, even re wired the whole CAN in case mis communication could be the issue but the issue persists.\n\nWhat I notice is that when I active the PID it reaches the setpoint without issue and stays in place for like 1-2 seconds and then starts falling, after inspecting the controllers they look like they are trying to move because the LED showcase its moving and then another issue I see is that the SPARK Resets or something because if I ress the same button the set point changes.\n\nAlso thanks very much for the explanation on the PID it will be very helpful for future PID tuning.",
