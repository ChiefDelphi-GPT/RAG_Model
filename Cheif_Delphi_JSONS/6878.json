                    "cooked": "There was an interesting thread about whether Mechanical Design can be learned.  I think good design can be learned, but learning good design is often as a result of experiencing the consequences of bad design decisions.  Another interesting way to ask the same question is “Can Mechanical Design be taught?”.  Good mechanical design is a lot like Wisdom.  It’s possible to learn Wisdom and Mechanical Design.  It’s much harder to teach Wisdom and Mechanical Design.  Both are the result of hard won lessons learned, and both can be taught by telling stories of the painful experiences that resulted in the aphorisms that are “Wisdom” and “rules for Good Design”.  (If you ever want to start up a lively conversation, ask a room full of senior mechanical engineers, “Which are better, Helicoils or Keenserts, and why?” )\n\nOne of the earliest lessons I learned the hard way back when I was starting my career was to never use set screws to transmit power.  They ALWAYS eventually back out and the joint slips.  Especially if the torque across the joint is reversing.  Set screws are fine for attaching knobs to potentiometers in near zero torque applications, but in high torque applications, you should find another way.  Let me tell you a story of yet another painful failure that reinforces this design principle.\n\nIn our last match at CHS DCMP we lost a swerve drive module with about 1:30 left in the match.  At the time we were a good bit ahead in the score.  At that point we were crippled, though we managed to limp back to a chain and hang for 3 points.  Our teammates managed to keep the other alliance from pulling ahead until under 15 seconds were left in the match, but ultimately we lost and were eliminated.\n\nWhen we returned to the pit, we found that one swerve module was jammed in the steering direction.  One of the toothed clips that holds the driving motor pinion was on top of the steering pulley, and the drive motor pinion had slid down to interfere with a drive motor gear.  Here is what a good module looks like, with the drive pinion and clip circled. image 1218×775 88.9 KB\n\nimage 1218×775 88.9 KB\n\nimage 1218×775 88.9 KB\n\nWe had never seen one of these toothed clips come off a motor shaft even though we’ve been using them for over a decade in various gearboxes.  This was the first mechanical failure we’ve had in one of our SDS swerve modules in the 3 years we’ve been using them.  We were at a loss how the clip could possibly come off the motor shaft to allow the pinion to fall.  Last night at our first meeting since returning from DCMP , we pulled out the swerve module to try to figure out what went wrong.  As often is the case with mechanical failures, the root cause wasn’t immediately obvious.  The first thing we observed was that the pinion hadn’t slipped off the motor shaft.  The motor shaft itself had slipped down into the driver gear.  The spinning gear stripped the clip off the motor shaft and let the pinion fall. image 1192×797 90.7 KB\n\nimage 1192×797 90.7 KB\n\nimage 1192×797 90.7 KB\n\nThis begged the question: How was the motor shaft able to slide down like that, right out of the motor?  Wasn’t the motor shaft securely attached to the brushless motor bell?  We popped the outer cover off the motor and found the culpret to be… setscrews.  Here is how the bell is attached to the shaft on a “good” motor. image 1492×781 73.8 KB\n\nimage 1492×781 73.8 KB\n\nimage 1492×781 73.8 KB\n\nIn each of the two slots there is a setscrew screwed in flush with the side of the pocket which is pressed against flats in the motor shaft. image 491×543 49.9 KB On our damaged motor, both setscrews had clearly backed out  2 or 3 turns so the top of the screw was proud of the slot. image 756×837 88.9 KB image 1076×625 28.5 KB This allowed the bell to come loose from the shaft, and with repeated slamming back and forth, eventually the tips of the setscrews came off.  We were only able to remove one of the setscrews for inspection of the tip.  The cup point is gone. image 831×685 32.7 KB Here is the other screw, sheared off and still in the bell. image 756×798 71.7 KB\n\nimage 491×543 49.9 KB\n\nimage 491×543 49.9 KB\n\nimage 756×837 88.9 KB\n\nimage 756×837 88.9 KB\n\nimage 1076×625 28.5 KB\n\nimage 1076×625 28.5 KB\n\nimage 831×685 32.7 KB\n\nimage 831×685 32.7 KB\n\nimage 756×798 71.7 KB\n\nimage 756×798 71.7 KB\n\nOnce the shaft came loose from the bell, it worked its way down towards the steering pulley until first the toothed retainer was stripped off, then the motor pinion was jammed by the drive gear mounted to the steering pulley.  That jamming force, combined with the long moment arm from the extended motor shaft snapped the mount for the stator coils. image 855×675 41.6 KB\n\nimage 855×675 41.6 KB\n\nimage 855×675 41.6 KB\n\nThus endith yet another story illustrating how setscrews suck.  Don’t use them to transmit power.\n\nAnd, if you are using NEO brushless motors in a reversing torque application, image 698×685 45.1 KB\n\nimage 698×685 45.1 KB\n\nimage 698×685 45.1 KB\n\ndo yourself a favor and inspect the connection between the bell and the motor shaft.\n\nYou can do this by removing the top cover with a Torx T8 driver. image 1154×751 47.3 KB\n\nimage 1154×751 47.3 KB\n\nimage 1154×751 47.3 KB\n\nVisually inspect to be sure the setscrews are flush with the sides of the slots.  If you can, check that there is no play in the joint, retighten the setscrews if they are loose and lock them and the bell/shaft joint with green loctite retaining compound.  Learn from our experience and don’t let this happen to you.\n\nAnd, always remember: setscrews are the devil.",

Both are the result of hard won lessons learned, and both can be taught by telling stories\n\nThis is slightly beside the point, but I just have to thank you for this analogy. It’s spot on and I’m gonna use it every time someone asks me that question. I’ve been looking for a way to explain it for way too long.\n\nAs to the motor failure, can’t say I’m too surprised. Although it’s sad to see the failure on a 1.1, because those have generally been the least risky option in the REV ecosystem.\n\nFine if you keep an eye on it, but not ideal.",
