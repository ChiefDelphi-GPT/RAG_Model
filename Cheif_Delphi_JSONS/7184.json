Compared to previous endgames, where you can reserve space (2022) (2019), cheesecake it onto a different mechanism (2018), or literally drive onto a platform. (2023), the trap requires you to design your entire robot for an RP and a few extra points around this objective. A single mechanism needs to perform 2+ functions, and the height limit, extension limit, and height of the chain make the design process incredibly difficult if you don’t plan for it ahead of time. The geometry is stupidly hard, but it looks easy. Try designing/planning for it, and it’s so much harder than it looks.\n\nThe hang is a bit difficult (not insanely), too, like the basic one. It’s so low to the ground that your bumpers can touch the floor on accident if you don’t plan for it.\n\nThat means less resources for the rest of the mechanisms, less drive practice, and significantly more complexity. You are effectively adding 500 percent more complexity and difficulty for your robot for 5 points. Drive practice + better mechanisms will give you so many more points. You’ll finish earlier, and your build season becomes much more comfortable.\n\n“ RP is important!” Winning gives you 2 RP , and RP doesn’t matter in elims. In a regional format, you need to win your event to get to worlds, and in a district format, making elims consistently, then making elims at DCMP makes you worlds. Getting an extra 1 RP but being bad at scoring doesn’t do that. Scoring really really really well does that.\n\nUnless you are good enough to be ranked 1 in your event or at worlds in previous years, and you are already a team that can design in a way to be good at scoring anyway, the trap is a trap. Getting picked early gives you the same DP as the captain. The first pick goes to worlds, too. If you’re scoring 2x more than everyone else who’s doing trap, you’ll obviously get picked over them.\n\nBuild fast, build reliably, get drive practice, and do well. I don’t want many teams to suffer just because they wanted to do a trap mechanism.",

Conversely, if you are the only top robot at the event that can score in the trap, and you are reasonably competent at the game’s other tasks, you’re pretty likely to earn the 1 seed.\n\nI agree wholeheartedly that the trap is only useful for teams that expect to be fighting for the ideal alliance captain position.

As a guess only, about 24 teams will go to Champs based on pure District Points.",

                    "cooked": "I agree that the trap is exceedingly difficult compared to recent years, but I believe you can design a robot capable of doing the trap without making too many sacrifices in the rest of your design, so mid-tier and higher teams will definitely work on designs for it. If done right, a trap mechanism that doesn’t work shouldn’t cause issues for the rest of your robot.\n\nUnfortunately, at least at the extremely competitive regionals in California, you won’t seed anywhere near the top unless you get 4RP almost every match. Back in 2022 we went undefeated through an entire competition but were being bumped between the top few seeds due 2 matches where we only received 3RP (we ended up solidly in 1st seed only after beating the other top contenders in matches late in quals).\n\nTo get 4RP this year, you only have a few choices:\n\nall 3 robots climbing, two of which being on the same chain (2 climbing robots in an alliance is fairly common, but all 3 isn’t sometimes)\n\n2 robots climbing, on the same chain, while also being spotlit (requires a really good human player)\n\nsome combination of climbing and trap scoring\n\nBeing able to consistently do the trap is one of the most surefire ways to ensure you can get that extra ranking point IMO.",
