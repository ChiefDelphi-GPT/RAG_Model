Hi, all, and happy holidays. I bring you tidings of a new telescoping arm robot.\n\nSome of you may remember that back in the summer of 2019, I threw together my very first telescoping arm design and posted it here. In the meantime, I’ve played around with new designs , and I figured that it was time to design a complete robot to show off what’s new. I’ve also used this as a chance to get familiar with the new REV control system, which is the main reason it took me so long to upload this in the first place (I was waiting the whole time for REV to drop their CAD models…).\n\nDrivetrain\n\ndrivetrain with electronics back 1920×1080 194 KB\n\ndrivetrain with electronics back 1920×1080 194 KB\n\ndrivetrain with electronics back 1920×1080 194 KB\n\nI heard the cool kids these days were all doing single speed, single reduction gearboxes with their shiny new Falcon motors, so I joined them. It’s very convenient as a design structure and I’ll probably do it again on future designs. I also tried out the “corner horn” approach to supporting the bumpers, which at the cost of increased manufacturing effort (welding!) gives you an extra ~1.5\" of wheelbase.\n\nManipulation\n\npickup back 1920×1080 1.4 MB intake back 1920×1080 487 KB manipulator back 1920×1080 835 KB\n\npickup back 1920×1080 1.4 MB\n\npickup back 1920×1080 1.4 MB\n\nintake back 1920×1080 487 KB\n\nintake back 1920×1080 487 KB\n\nmanipulator back 1920×1080 835 KB\n\nmanipulator back 1920×1080 835 KB\n\nOne of the key things that I really didn’t like about my first design was that the manipulator was ridiculously large and heavy, and for all of that weight, I didn’t even get much width to pick up balls. To solve this, the top roller has moved from the manipulator to its own, separate system, which allows it to be wider without having to figure out how to control a 30 pound manipulator. I also got aroud to adding some fancy sensors - a reflection sensor for balls and a limit switch for hatch panels. Otherwise, it’s a pretty standard 1684-esque manipulator - the arms close together to grab hatch panels from the center.\n\nArm\n\nball scoring back 1920×1080 1.26 MB arm stowed back 1920×1080 959 KB arm extended back 1920×1080 85.3 KB arm bearing detail back 1920×1080 785 KB arm hub exploded back 1920×1080 980 KB\n\nball scoring back 1920×1080 1.26 MB\n\nball scoring back 1920×1080 1.26 MB\n\narm stowed back 1920×1080 959 KB\n\narm stowed back 1920×1080 959 KB\n\narm extended back 1920×1080 85.3 KB\n\narm extended back 1920×1080 85.3 KB\n\narm bearing detail back 1920×1080 785 KB\n\narm bearing detail back 1920×1080 785 KB\n\narm hub exploded back 1920×1080 980 KB\n\narm hub exploded back 1920×1080 980 KB\n\nThe arm is a total redesign from all of the previous telescoping arms I’ve done, with an emphasis on ease of manufacturing and assembly. This time, there’s only one unique billet part (as opposed to the 12 or so on my first telescoping arm), the arm hub. I’ve included detail views on the bearings and arm hub to show off some clever design tricks there. The bearing replaces the old billet base block with a 3D printed setup, but uses the same extended inner ring bearings as before. The pulley uses a much beefier body and mounting setup than my last few designs, and pivots around a thicker shoulder screw. On the hub, the sprocket is mounted using a set of shoulder screws to take up the side loads from pivoting, while we use the same clamping-block style as before.\n\nClimber\n\nclimbing back 1920×1080 2.24 MB climber back 1920×1080 333 KB\n\nclimbing back 1920×1080 2.24 MB\n\nclimbing back 1920×1080 2.24 MB\n\nclimber back 1920×1080 333 KB\n\nclimber back 1920×1080 333 KB\n\nI didn’t like that my first telescoping arm robot didn’t have a climber, so I’m here to correct that issue. The intake arm doubles as a climbing arm, and in the back, we have a set of legs which extend down. There’s not much else to this design (it wasn’t very original anyway) but it was a neat addition and it fit well with the rest of the robot.\n\nI’m glad I managed to get this uploaded before Kickoff - that way, if any of you all feel like making a telescoping arm this January, you can feel free to use this design as much as you like. Thanks for reading this all the way through. If you didn’t read this all the way through, what are you doing? Go back and look at my pretty pictures. Feel free to check out the CAD here - same link as on the top of the post.\n\nAs always, questions and comments are much appreciated!",

                    "cooked": "Thanks for the questions!\n\nGeeTwo:\n\nI don’t understand the extension at all. I’m guessing that the gearbox shown at top right of “arm stowed back” powers it, but I don’t see how it controls the first stage, much less the second. At first I thought the cylinder in the foreground of that gearbox was a pair of motors facing each other, but now it looks more like a drum, and the motor might be just above that cylinder.\n\nIs/are there some cable/cord/chain/belt/rack I’m missing? If so, please show it/them.\n\nWhere is/are the motor[s] or other actuators for extension?\n\nDoes the extension work equally in each stage, or does one stage extend first, and if so which one extends first and why?\n\nThere are in fact 2 cables in extension - the first stage extension rope is visible as a gray cylinder on the very top extending out from the drum, while the second stage rope can just barely be seen on the bottom of the middle stage.\n\nExtension is powered by a single Falcon motor, which you can barely see behind the spool (which you correctly identified).\n\nThe arm is cascade-rigged, so for every inch the middle stage moves the end stage will move 2 inches. I’ve included a detail view below, which may elucidate things:\n\ntelescope section info detail 2334×889 369 KB\n\ntelescope section info detail 2334×889 369 KB\n\ntelescope section info detail 2334×889 369 KB\n\nRealistically, what I call a “rope” in this picture is really two separate ropes on the same route, one for pulling up and one for pulling down, but I never actually got around to making them not a complete loop. The S1 rope is tied to the spool and to the S2 moving bearing, which has the effect of pulling the middle stage up as the spool is wound. Meanwhile, the cascade rope is tied to the S1 fixed bearing and the S3 moving bearing, which causes it to pull the 3rd stage up along with the 2nd stage at double the velocity.\n\nGeeTwo:\n\nThe arm extension bearings are a similar source of mystery.\n\nWhy are there [external] bearings only on one face for each stage, and the bearings for the stages opposite each other?\n\nAs the arm swings both ways, the rack forces should apply each direction at various times - how do these one sided bearings deal with this?\n\nAre there similar bearings inside the arm for each stage? If so, are they on the same or opposite side, and mounted on the inner or outer stage?\n\nI think what you call external bearings are actually the rope redirect pulleys. The bearings are actually sandwiched between the aluminum plate and the nylon block. For each fixed bearing block, there’s also a matching bearing block with outward-facing bearings on the stage above it. I’ve included an exploded view here, which shows how the outward-facing bearings work:\n\ns2 bottom bearing detail back 1920×1080 532 KB\n\ns2 bottom bearing detail back 1920×1080 532 KB\n\ns2 bottom bearing detail back 1920×1080 532 KB\n\nAccordingly, the racking issues mostly come into play when near the maximum extension. However, given the skinny shape of the arm and the high overlap at max extension, I wasn’t very concerned about racking. The only note I would make for someone trying to fabricate this in person is that extrusions are rarely exactly dead-nuts on with their sizing, so the bearings will have to be resized to fit whatever tolerance error there is on your stock.\n\nGeeTwo:\n\nWould you please show some detail on the “wrist”? That is, the hinge between the end of the arm and the roller claw. It seems to have at least 150 degrees of motion, but I can’t make out anything on it.\n\nOf course! The wrist is a NEO 550 driving a 49:1 versaplanetary, with an 18:64 reduction after that.\n\nimage 1981×1478 209 KB\n\nimage 1981×1478 209 KB\n\nimage 1981×1478 209 KB\n\nGeeTwo:\n\nI count 2 degrees of freedom for the drivetrain, 1 for the climber legs, 2 for the intake, 3 for the pink arm (shoulder, extend, wrist), and 2 for the roller claw, making 10. Did I miss any?\n\nThat’s correct, unless you count the pneumatic cylinder on the manipulator as an extra degree of freedom.\n\nGeeTwo:\n\nhe intake appears to have six vectored (mecanum) wheels and one omni.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nMost vectored intake bars have solid or compliant wheels in the middle. Why omni?\n\nYes. As far as why-omni, it’s because 100 actually used the same setup (albeit with 4\" wheels) in 2019 to great success, and I saw no reason to change it.\n\nGeeTwo:\n\nAm I understanding correctly that the energy chain travels inside the arm, and the yellow bracket is basically a casette for the excess when the arm is down?\n\nYes.\n\nGeeTwo:\n\nWhy do all of the render titles end in “back”? They appear to be from a variety of angles.\n\nThe “back” marker is for me - when I make renders, the render that gets saved is a transparent PNG. I keep that transparent image around in case I need to touch it up, but I upload the images with a solid-colored background so that they show up well on all kinds of backgrounds. The versions with backgrounds get the word “back” put on them.",

I intentionally made it so that the mounting holes for the bearings at the bottom of each stage can be accessed through the pocketing holes of the stage surrounding them. The net effect should be that you can assemble the whole thing by shoving the bearing assembly inside of the tube, tying the ropes and rigging on, and then inserting the inside tube and attaching it to the bearing. If this doesn’t make sense, let me know and I will add some pictures\n\nYou will need a solution for tensioning the ropes. I would recommend using a turnbuckle on the first stage (and if you can fit it, also the second stage). I would absolutely put a tension spring in both stages to pick up changes - you want it to be ~0.25-0.3\" in diameter and as long as you can get it.\n\nI’m not 100% happy with the design of the pulleys on the cascade stages. I suggest you experiment a little and figure out if you want to swap them out for some other approach.",

The belt here is nearly flush with the inside tube, so a single clamp plate on the inner stage would be enough to retain it. On the outside, you can add a tensioner pulley (using whatever your favorite tensioner stackup is).",

There are many solutions out there for clamping a belt, but the easiest approach is to 3D print the negative of the belt tooth pattern and screw it into a backing plate (in fact, you can find exactly that in the climber assembly of the same robot).\n\nThis results in four tie-down points: two in the second moving stage and two in the fixed stage (one each for the pull-up and pull-down belts). To tension it, you can use a screw to move two of the tie-down points closer to each other. In my opinion, the easy spot to put a tensioner would be to mount it to the fixed bearing assembly on the fixed stage.\n\nTo tension the first moving stage’s belt, I would simply use an idle roller, as you would need one anyway to interface with the driver pulley.",
