It is the thing with the globe on it.\n\nDouble click on the newly created global variable.  This should open the new global variable VI.\n\nAdd the new “indicator” (or “control”) and save this VI file to the name and directory of your choosing.\n\nBack in the original VI use the drop down to pick the specific global variable in this new VI.\n\nAfter that, I think the easiest way to create new variable instances from new global variable VI is to drag the global variable VI onto the block diagram of a normal VI.  (There are other ways.)\n\nI have to stress with students (usually multiple times once they find that global variables are easy) that global variables are NEVER a replacement for wiring – when wiring can be done.   They are only for wrapping with read and write VI (in other words each global variable should only be used twice – once in the read VI and once in the write VI) so that they can be used to 1) communicate with VI in other systems, or 2) communicate with VI that aren’t subordinate (subroutines), 3) communicate with VI in different loops.",

There wasn’t much other choice…\n\nIn C, C++, (and LabVIEW) one has to be really careful about data synchronization issues.  For robot use, we use global variables in situations where it is okay to use only the last written value.  (Left wheel speed, Left wheel speed setpoint, gyro angle, etc.)\n\nAlso, for global variables, since the value is volatile, the compiler can’t perform some optimizations on the code using the global variable.   ( I don’t know anything about the “allocating additional memory” thing.)\n\nFor object oriented languages (C++, Java, and LabVIEW classes) it always seems better to me to use the things available there, like “getter” and “setter” methods to set the value stored inside an object instantiated from a particular class. (personal preference).\n\nI don’t show LabVIEW classes (I don’t know a lot about them other than they exist), so the global variable method described in my original post sort of imitates this for a one instance pseudo class ( drive system for example ).  Easier to show and implement.",

Is that true?\n\nThat’s still definitely true.  It’s less about memory or loop speed and more about access.\n\nIf you live alone and your favorite snack is disappearing from your fridge, you know exactly who to blame.\n\nIf you live with several roomies all having access to the fridge, who did it?\n\nYou’re more likely to get yourself into trouble by letting everyone have access to your favorite snacks similar as you will if all of your app can touch the variables.  Instead, you generally want to focus on the communication between things and let one thing own the data.\n\nThe Command and Control Will mentioned lets you do things like open up all of your drive train motors in a drive subsystem and only control those motors there.  Anywhere else can ask the drive controller to make the robot move but none can actually control the motors themselves, for example.",

                    "cooked": "JSIMPSO:\n\nOne of the primary principles of hard real-time programming is the code needs to be deterministic.\n\nYou’re communicating via WiFi.  There are zero true deterministic robots here.\n\nJSIMPSO:\n\nLimiting or eliminating dynamic things is one of the ways this is achieved.\n\nIt’s no more dynamic than what you mentioned.  It’s dividing a robot into systems and having a set of routines for each.  It just uses encapsulation versus global variables (a better programming practice for teaching the students).\n\nJSIMPSO:\n\nDynamic code execution (and dynamic memory allocation) can cause unexpected results\n\nTrue.  But, neither exist in command and control.  However, using global variables often causes unexpected results.  The shift to CnC here resolves a problem you’re creating with your architecture that you claim to worry about.\n\nJSIMPSO:\n\nI’d rather show students concepts that they can take with them and use again later.\n\nIf you’re showing them globals, you’re not doing this.  CnC is very similar to: Model–view–controller - Wikipedia This is something they can absolutely take with them.\n\nJSIMPSO:\n\nI’d rather teach them how to build a finite state machine, or use sequential digital logic, or traditional analog control concepts.\n\nNothing in what you suggested using a FSM.  You’re breaking about every driving idea behind a FSM.\n\nJSIMPSO:\n\nCreate a separate global variables VI for each system. This makes the code better separated (isolated), easier to port, debug, maintain, use.\n\nYou’re doing the opposite of “isolating” code by creating access globally.\n\nJSIMPSO:\n\nThese concepts will carry over to a computer science education or to industrial control systems. (The overall control concept of acquire, decide, execute seems simpler to me.)\n\nComputer science will want to avoid pretty much all of the advice you gave above in favor of abstraction and encapsulation.\n\nJSIMPSO:\n\nOn a personal note, I like simple. The command and control system seems to add unneeded extra complexity.\n\nI can understand this.  Simple is often easier to digest and can be easier to explain/teach to others.  It meets far fewer of the goals you listed prior, though.  It’s also a bit strange to me to list simplicity and then post what you had above.  You create global variables and then build getters and setters around global variables (they don’t need these.  Getters and setters are made such that you can access data you don’t otherwise have access to.  If you already have access, the getters/setters are redundant and add complexity without any value, for example).\n\nJSIMPSO:\n\nI don’t show LabVIEW classes (I don’t know a lot about them other than they exist), so the global variable method described in my original post sort of imitates this for a one instance pseudo class ( drive system for example ).\n\nI’m personally not a fan of these in the RT space.  Others would disagree.\n\nJSIMPSO:\n\nI have to stress with students (usually multiple times once they find that global variables are easy) that global variables are NEVER a replacement for wiring – when wiring can be done. They are only for wrapping with read and write VI (in other words each global variable should only be used twice – once in the read VI and once in the write VI)\n\nI’d agree with the first bit.  The second seems strange.  Again, it’s a redundant functionality and eliminates the ability for you to right-click and find the global variable instances quickly.\n\nTom_Line:\n\nOut of curiosity, how do you create additional robot global data vis for other systems? That’s something we’ve never done.\n\nGlobal variables are going to be accessible by the other systems.  I can think of a couple of ways to create specific sets of globally accessible variables for a specific system.  But, it’s an absurd amount of complexity with no real gain.",

This will happen no faster than 50 Hz, and any dropped packets will make it slower still.\n\nDoing any sensor-based control loops inside the separate Periodic Tasks vi will allow them to happen at their own rate (which can often be much faster) that is asynchronous from the DS packets. The fact that it becomes asynchronous does potentially introduce extra latency to joystick values actually reaching the motors, but that effect is marginal compared to what it does for your closed loops (especially if you’re updating the motor values at least twice as fast as Teleop runs, which is generally not too difficult to achieve in my experience).\n\nThis is why Will said teleop should only have joystick mapping; it’s the only data that’s hard-constrained by DS packet delivery anyway.",
