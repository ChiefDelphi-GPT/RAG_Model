However, if there’s sufficient demand, we’re open to making BumbleBoard cross-platform and open-source in the future. In fact, we’re already planning improvements, and a new release is expected next month.\n\nComparison with Elastic: We began developing BumbleBoard before Elastic was released, and when it was, Elastic didn’t meet our specific requirements. BumbleBoard was designed to include unique features that Elastic currently lacks. For examle: Support for multiple entries in the same graph and Text indicators for displaying values like enums, states, or other text-based data.\n\nElastic certainly has its strengths. However, BumbleBoard is designed to meet more requirements, and we believe it offers unique benefits for teams looking for specific functionality.\n\nWe’d love to hear your feedback after you will try BumbleBoard",

The modern WPILib ecosystem distinguishes between “driver” dashboards (auton selector, camera streams, indicator lights) and “programmer” dashboards (post-match analysis and debugging tools). Elastic is a driver dashboard, so it omits diagnostic features that would distract drivers mid-match (the driver’s role is to drive, not troubleshoot). One could argue Elastic shouldn’t have a plot widget at all.\n\nThe other concern with serving both purposes in one tool is maintenance burden; that’s how WPILib’s SmartDashboard, SFX, and Shuffleboard dashboards died. Saying no to some features can help projects stay maintainable in the long-term.",

After extensive testing during the 2024 season, we’re confident it can enhance your team’s experience both on and off the field.\n\nAmit627:\n\nCreate a dashboard that works for your team with a highly flexible and easy-to-use interface.\n\nAmit627:\n\nWe’d love to hear your thoughts and feedback!

Releasing open-source code can be intimidating, especially for a new programmer. Students are excited about the projects they work on, I’d be disheartened if as a high schooler I shared what I built and it was met with nothing but critique.",

We thought it would be good to have a single dashboard to be used while practicing at home, debugging the software, calibrating systems, working in the pit and serving the drive team during the game, mainly because it will be in constant use and thus will become more powerful and stable with time. I agree that it has pros and cons, but this was the approach we chose. It made us work harder on the architecture and the variaty and customization of widgets, as well as on the performance needed for debugging which are more challenging than drive team requirements. We ended up with a result, the students were vey proud of (as well as myself), and we thought other teams that like our approach may benefit from it. In the spirit of FIRST we hope other teams will enjoy our work, and if not, this is OK as well … We would appreciate any constructive criticism that will contribute to making BumbleBoard better.",
