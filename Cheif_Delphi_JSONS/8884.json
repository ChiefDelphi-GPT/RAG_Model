                    "cooked": "All devices on a CAN bus are always in parallel. Yes, even if you daisy chain your motor controllers together, they are still wired in parallel, just with tiny branches of near zero length. But the problem with daisy chaining your can bus is that a single failure takes down every motor.\n\nSwitching to parallel wiring, if done correctly, can increase your sanity. I’m a bit sick of the kinds of messages in So many dead robots in Playoffs that claim that parallel can is impossible, too hard to do, or impossible over CAN FD.\n\nHere’s how 4096 Ctrl-Z has wired their drivetrain can bus for the past 2 years with great success. Our drivetrain for '22 and '23 has been 4 WCP SwerveX modules with Falcon500’s and a CANcoder on each. We also have a Pigeon 2 imu. They are on a Canivore CAN FD bus. We run a main CAN trunk around the drivetrain and make a branch for each device. The branches for the cancoders and pigeon are 10-12 inches long. The branches for the falcons are ~20 inches long (we didn’t want to snip off the second set of can wires off each motor since they aren’t user replaceable, so we just bundle them up).\n\nWe call this “parallel can with branches”. Mike Copioli called it “parallel pigtails”, which I think sounds more fun.\n\nimage 2000×1060 466 KB\n\nimage 2000×1060 466 KB\n\nimage 2000×1060 466 KB\n\nNow, we have had can failures. In the past two years, we’ve had a motor disconnect due to another robot reaching in yanking out exposed can wires. We’ve had a motor disconnect just due to poor wiring. In both cases, just the one motor dropped off the can bus. The rest of the drivetrain worked perfectly fine. And, in the DS console, we get error messages for exactly 1 can device, not for 13! How useful.\n\nFor connectors, the only 2 connectors we use for CAN are weidmuller (without ferrules) and lever nut. We moved away from all crimps (pwm and ferrule) as they were too error prone for us.",

                    "cooked": "When I hear people mentioning CAN Star layout, usually it involves having a branch of 3+ feet or so, usually running up the robot far away from the drivetrain. When the CAN spec says branches of 12in are fine, the margin of error is high enough that 20 inches is likely fine as well. I’m all for pigtailing off your subsystems like this, pretty much everyone agrees its either within CAN spec, or barely off in the case of the 20 inch branch. It doesn’t solve the problem where there are still multiple single points of failure across the bus. Its just that a single device can be lost without causing the rest to go down.",

It’s a can hub plus a 12V extender for cancoder power. In the future we’ll stop using the 12V rail and just use it for CAN. It would also be nice to redesign it to have levers instead of weidmuller as I personally like lever nuts more. Think mini PDH but with green and yellow instead of red and black.",

The Rio bus we do daisy chain as it only has 6 devices on it and runs up our arm. So if it gets cut, it would be the trunk being cut anyway so there’s not as large of a benefit going parallel.\n\nFor the drivetrain, the terminating resistor goes at the end of the trunk. The diagram is a slight simplification. We plug the terminating resistor into the second set of can leads in the last falcon. But really, it’s the same as putting it at the end of the trunk.",

This standard is artificial but significantly reduces the possibility of CAN reflection where the same motor shows up on the bus twice which leads to some pretty funky behavior.\n\n100% recommend the switch, it is valid asf and means if one motor dies, we are still trapping on the field",
