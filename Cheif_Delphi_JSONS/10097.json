                    "cooked": "Hello! I’m working on a project utilizing LQR to achieve accurate positions for Swerve Module azimuths. as a proof of concept that it could possibly be a better approach in season as opposed to my team’s tradition approach of PID control (Which cost us a lot of time this season). I’ve built my Module class around a pre-defined Linear System Loop . However, my error originates in constants, where each module is defined when the Modules are created.\n\nHere’s what the Constants file which defines the Module(s) and where the error originates from looks like:\n\nFor some additional context, I’m also trying to utilize Advantage Kit for the replay and logging features it has, but I can’t get much use out of it so far considering nothing can be logged if it crashed prior to logging starting.\n\nThis is what the console looks like:\n\nMy initial solution was to remove all references to special values such as Double.NaN and Infinity as per this: drake Namespace Reference , and Github Issue .\n\nAt some point during my debugging session, I was able to yield a different (Much more revealing) error, (With a stacktrace!):\n\nUnfortunately, I have since gone back to the original error message, which isn’t very helpful for debugging my system. Looking at those two issues since then again, I tried removing any references to negative Qelms and Relms, but I don’t actually have any when defining LinearSystemLoop or in my Constants (Where the modules are defined) as a whole. The only place they could appear is getting simulated encoder Absolute values, or From Joystick Inputs (Which wouldn’t make sense because the Joystick isn’t reference yet or even plugged in for that matter).\n\nTherefore, as my last option and not making any progress for the last 3 hours, I have posted here. Anybody have any suggestions? Is this just limited to Simulated code because of something to do with the JNI?",

The main reason to use LQR is for conceptual clarity and to keep your code in more interpretable units, rather than for performance.  I don’t mean to discourage you from pursuing LQR; I just want to make sure you have realistic expectations about how it’s likely to function.\n\nThe LinearSystemLoop abstraction is, in my opinion, a little bit overwrought and I think you might have better luck using the Kalman filter and LQR objects directly with your own plumbing.",

The encoder getters can return negative values, which would throw the second exception you saw.\n\nThe first one is from Q not being symmetric. It should be symmetric by construction though with the LQR overload you used.\n\nBy the way, we rewrote our DARE solver for 2024, and it will have better error messages than Drake’s (we call the C++ solver in JNI, which forwards the exception messages to Java).\n\n// Require Q be symmetric\n\nif ((Q - Q.transpose()).norm() > 1e-10) {\n\nstd::string msg = fmt::format(\"Q isn't symmetric!\\n\\nQ =\\n{}\\n\", Q);\n\nthrow std::invalid_argument(msg);\n\n}\n\n// Require Q be positive semidefinite\n\n//\n\n// If Q is a symmetric matrix with a decomposition LDLᵀ, the number of\n\n// positive, negative, and zero diagonal entries in D equals the number of\n\n// positive, negative, and zero eigenvalues respectively in Q (see\n\n// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvester's_law_of_inertia).\n\n//\n\n// Therefore, D having no negative diagonal entries is sufficient to prove Q\n\n// is positive semidefinite.\n\nauto Q_ldlt = Q.ldlt();\n\nif (Q_ldlt.info() != Eigen::Success ||\n\n(Q_ldlt.vectorD().array() < 0.0).any()) {\n\nstd::string msg =\n\nfmt::format(\"Q isn't positive semidefinite!\\n\\nQ =\\n{}\\n\", Q);\n\nyotam201410:\n\nIn addition, keep in mind that robot Rio is very limited and has a hard time processing a lot of LQR loops and with it being a loop per module it can really take a lot of memory and processing power from the rest of the robot\n\nI disagree with this. There’s construction cost from solving the DARE, but that should only happen at boot. After, that, it’s just a few floating point multiplies and adds in calculate() called every loop. Granted, EJML adds some intermediate matrix object allocations in there too, because Java doesn’t let us have nice things; C++ doesn’t have this overhead.\n\npublic Matrix<Inputs, N1> calculate(Matrix<States, N1> x) {\n\nm_u = m_K.times(m_r.minus(x));\n\nreturn m_u;\n\n}\n\nTo make snippets of code like that more performant, we could rewrite it to use free functions on double[] instances (would be way less readable), or make the Java classes JNI wrappers around the C++ versions (would be a lot more boilerplate in the backend).\n\nIn any case, the first rule of performance is to measure. Once someone demonstrates it’s a performance bottleneck in a benchmark, we’ ll optimize it. Rotation3d.rotateBy() was a recent instance of this; it was being called hundreds of times per loop, and we sped it up by 100x by replacing EJML vector operations in the underlying quaternion object with raw doubles.",
