I find that for a lot of FRC , the engineering has already been done by teams and mentors in the past, and creating new mechanisms relies heavily on drawing from what’s worked in the past rather than modifying and understanding concepts. For example, any design student I talk to can model an intake or elevator by referencing something from another team or a site like FRCDesign.org , tweaking a few dimensions or resketching a little to fit the game piece or packaging requirements. I feel like this doesn’t teach them enough about how the math and physics behind these mechanisms work, and makes it difficult to apply their skills to personal projects in other ecosystems.\n\nNot sure if other teams even see what I’m describing as an issue, but I’d like to set up our students with a good foundation for working on projects outside of FIRST alongside having competitive technical teams when the season hits. For context, we’re also running without any technical mentors, which has made it difficult to get a lot of training up and running.\n\nOf course, re-engineering every mechanism from scratch each season isn’t practical. But how do your teams make sure students understand how their designs work in principle? How do you incorporate general engineering concepts (like you’d learn in an intro high school or college class) into your training or project workflow?\n\nThanks in advance.",

You can’t avoid drive bases being standardized, that’s probably a good thing.  But how you’d do odd things with manipulators makes their brains work.  Balloons come to mind.  Get them off the floor and into a tall wastebasket.  Grab strings from helium versions near the ceiling and get them into a laundry basket under a table.  With of course the usual perimeter and height restrictions.  Or pick something else.  Just make sure the collective FRC hive mind has nothing anywhere close.  Because I’m just a bit mean I’d add a couple of fans blowing cross currents intermittently…",

                    "cooked": "For me it comes back to the Engineering Design Process. Make sure team members document how they completed each step of the process.\n\nIf you Google “Engineering Design Process,” you’ll get dozens of options. Most of them are from academic institutions who can build prototypes, but rarely build final deliverable solutions. The process I use with teams is the same one used on government contracts:\n\nIdentify\n\nDesign\n\nBuild\n\nIterate\n\nCommunicate\n\nImplied in starting with existing designs from the past or from other teams is that you aren’t studying the problem. What separates the Identify step from the Problem step is Problem versus Solution. Too many teams, and too many engineers, skip understanding the Problem and start with trying to come up with a solution. Defining the Problem is a lot harder than it looks.\n\nThe difference between the Design step and the Build step is working on paper or working with materials. Before you start cutting metal or mounting motors or typing code, you need to have a plan. The Design step is about building the plan.\n\nThe Design step runs in two phases. First you try to come up with as many possible solutions as you can. This is more of a brainstorming step in that you don’t eliminate any options. You look as every idea, even the crazy ones. The second phase is evaluating all the options and narrowing it down to a few for prototypes or one as the baseline ready to build. Never start narrowing down the selection before there are at least three options to evaluate.\n\nThe evaluation process needs to have criteria against which you can determine if one option is better than another. These criteria come from the Problem definition. If you haven’t defined the Problem, then there is no way to determine which possible solution will work better or worse.\n\nAll options are documented. All evaluations and final scores are documented. Reasoning used for how you selected one option over another is documented. All of this is called an Engineering Trade Study. About halfway through the Build step, someone will have a great idea on a change. It will actually be one of the options you already evaluated. When they propose making the change, you’ll need to have the Trade Study to review why the team decided not to go that direction in the first place.\n\nEvery Trade Study should include criteria for Time, Money, and Expertise. If you have a great option that no one knows how to build, then it probably isn’t right for your team.\n\nThe Iterate step starts with testing. Make a plan for your testing and then collect data on how well your robot (I.e., Solution) does in the test. Try your best to test under conditions as close to competition as possible. Again, test to the Problem, not to the Solution.\n\nMost Hardware Engineering fails because the Problem is not well understood and something was built that doesn’t actually play the game well. Most Software Engineering fails because the Software Design was rushed and programmers started building code before they had a plan for the code. This leads to lots of extra time trying to maintain or rebuild the code in the Iterate step.\n\nThe reason most teams give me for not doing Identify well and not doing Design well is that there is no time in the season. Use the Off Season on smaller projects, like one mechanism, to be deliverable with these steps. The more you practice good Identify practices and good Design practices, the easier and faster these steps can be done following Kickoff.",

It is always eye opening to see the world through someone else’s eyes. Doing your own game development will help you see things in the new Game Manual at Kickoff, and this will help in the Identify step.\n\nIt can be very expensive and time consuming to build a full FRC or FTC robot during the Off Season. Consider developing a game and then building to it for the eXperiential Robotics Platform (XRP, https://experientialrobotics.org/ ).\n\nThe game can be played on a 4’x8’ FLL Competition Table or on a pool table. You might not get experience with Swerve Modules, but you can practice the full Engineering Design Process. This can also set you up for hosting a summer camp as a fundraiser next year or run a local competition as an outreach event in the community.",
