The system works by generating a unique QR code on the admin’s screen that resets every 11 seconds. Students simply scan the QR code using their smartphones, instantly marking their attendance.\n\nNow after completing 100 user Alpha testing. Beta Version is ready for all teams to try. Please keep in mind Beta version might have unknown/unforseen bugs. Works with both IOS and Android based devices.\n\nFast & Contactless: No need for manual check-ins; just scan and go.\n\nQR Code Generation: A dynamic QR code appears on the team admin’s screen, which students scan to record their attendance.\n\nInstant Record Keeping: Attendance data is automatically logged and stored for easy access.\n\nTeam Management: Helps mentors keep track of team participation and engagement.\n\nFree\n\nCSV User Import: Import without actually uploading the file. Just select the file and system will scan it for you.\n\nWhat do you need to use it?\n\nStudents: A phone, tablet, or computer with a camera capable of scanning a QR code and a stable internet connection.\n\nMentors/Coaches: A phone, tablet, or computer to display the QR code for students, along with a stable internet connection.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nStudent:\n\nAndroid: IN ACTION IOS: IPAD\n\nTeam Admin:\n\ndispplayqr add_std\n\nTo comply with age restrictions and Data Protection Laws, children under 13 and California teams are not allowed to register. Only team admins can import student data via a CSV file. A default password chosen by the team admin will be assigned to all students which they will be forced to change on their first login.\n\nSelf-registration is not allowed for mentors, coaches, or students. If your team wants to use the system, a mentor should DM me to receive their team admin credentials. Team admins are allowed to reset their own passwords. Student password can be reset by the team admin.(See upcoming feature list below.) Students can change their password from their profile page if they remember their current password .\n\nTwo-Factor Authentication (2FA) is highly recommended for both mentors and students.\n\nUser Group Permissions Team Admins Display QR codes, edit student and teacher information, add/remove attendance manually. Students View their own attendance records and scan QR codes.\n\nTeam Admin Dashboard:\n\nimage 1919×871 37.1 KB image 1918×876 62.2 KB image 1919×872 21.6 KB image 1918×884 56 KB image 1919×878 85.9 KB image 1919×876 42.3 KB\n\nimage 1919×871 37.1 KB\n\nimage 1919×871 37.1 KB\n\nimage 1918×876 62.2 KB\n\nimage 1918×876 62.2 KB\n\nimage 1919×872 21.6 KB\n\nimage 1919×872 21.6 KB\n\nimage 1918×884 56 KB\n\nimage 1918×884 56 KB\n\nimage 1919×878 85.9 KB\n\nimage 1919×878 85.9 KB\n\nimage 1919×876 42.3 KB\n\nimage 1919×876 42.3 KB\n\nStudent Dashboard:\n\nimage 1919×885 55.7 KB image 1919×868 159 KB image 1915×864 66.5 KB image 1916×870 105 KB\n\nimage 1919×885 55.7 KB\n\nimage 1919×885 55.7 KB\n\nimage 1919×868 159 KB\n\nimage 1919×868 159 KB\n\nimage 1915×864 66.5 KB\n\nimage 1915×864 66.5 KB\n\nimage 1916×870 105 KB\n\nimage 1916×870 105 KB\n\nKnown bugs:\n\nIf QR is scanned as soon it gets generated and server is behind the clock, it might send out a warning saying invalid QR. Incase this happens, please re-scan the QR.\n\nPassword reset has a hourly limit. If the quota is exceeded, reset mails won’t be sent. You can retry the next hour. Fix is pending until we find a hosting with higher limit. (Patch applied for team admins)\n\nOnly one team admin can display QR code. (Already solved and patch will be applied next version.)\n\nUpcoming Features:\n\n“Limited team admin” group that can only generate QR and add manual attendance.\n\n“Parent” user group.\n\n“School” user group to see all attendance of teams affiliated with them.\n\nTC Kimlik based self registration for Turk users.\n\nFull Turkish translation.\n\nUI rework.\n\nOption to assign one team admin to multiple teams.\n\nRegion based datacenters to for faster access. (Currently Dallas,TX,USA)\n\nStudent self password reset (This depends on 2. bug in the list above.)\n\nNote:\n\nWe tried to make it run with as low data as possible. We only store E-mail adress, name, surname and username, password (encrypted),cookies and IP Adress(only for security reasons), team name|number. No analytics or ads.\n\nRegion selector does not currently work until feature 8 is introduced. You may select whichever one you want until then.\n\nFor all support requests please reach us at : support@quickattendance.com\n\nYes, we know UI is not our thing. 3 Backend devs and AI made the Frontend. We will remake the UI.",
