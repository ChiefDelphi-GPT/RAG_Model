My FRC team is planning to integrate photoVision into our robot to track its position in the arena, as well as detect robots along their trajectories in our autonomous system, implementing “reactive autonomous” or “intelligent autonomous.” Based on this, I want to ask:\n\n1: What were the main challenges in the process? 2: What were the main tools (libraries, resources) used? 3: How did you implement photovision? Using Orange PI 5?\n\nThank you in advance for your help!",

                    "cooked": "Take a look at the Quick Start page of PV ’s docs. It goes through the entire process of setting up the system and calibrating your cameras (which is necessary for 3D stuff, such as detecting AprilTags’ transformation from the camera).\n\nAfter you’ve read through the Quick Start, I’d really recommend looking through the entire docs for PhotonVision. Every single article on the site will give you more information in some way and will better prepare you for using PV quickly on a real robot.\n\nmurilo404:\n\n1: What were the main challenges in the process?\n\nTo be honest, if you follow along with the documentation, you can get PhotonVision going pretty easily. We didn’t really have any integration issues, and as we increased the code’s complexity, we didn’t see any issues from PV ’s end.\n\nWith that being said, it’s important to make sure that you keep the processor cool. We manufactured a 3D printed case for the Orange Pi that included a small fan to keep it cool. IIRC we saw temperatures approaching 85C before this but now it’s closer to 50-60 degrees Celsius.\n\nmurilo404:\n\n2: What were the main tools (libraries, resources) used?\n\nPretty much just PhotonLib (PhotonVision’s library in code) is necessary to setup PV .\n\nmurilo404:\n\n3: How did you implement photovision? Using Orange PI 5?\n\nAssuming you’re talking about hardware, we ran an Orange Pi 5 and we saw good success. The only downside is that it only has one USB3.0 slot, which limited our resolutions seeing as we ran four cameras off a dongle connected to that slot.\n\nWe used ArduCam OV9281s for our cameras, which worked well. Make sure to read the docs about the ArduCam-specific configuration however if you choose to go this way. There’s great support built into PV for ArduCams and they’re easy to configure. We’ve had few issues with them, and their performance is great. We had four ArduCams connected to one Orange Pi 5 and each was running 320x240 at nearly 120 FPS… Definitely not a performance concern - the limiting factor against upping the resolution was the fact that we were maxing out USB speeds.\n\nmurilo404:\n\ndetect robots along their trajectories in our autonomous system\n\nWhat do you mean by this? If you mean tracking and identifying other robots, that’s not a feature of PV .",

It can’t tell you where other robots are on the field, or whether a game piece is still in the same place. You have to do the processing on the results PV gives you to figure that out for yourself.\n\nIf you have any further questions, I’d encourage you to join the PV discord where there are people who would be more than happy to help you with getting PV set up.
