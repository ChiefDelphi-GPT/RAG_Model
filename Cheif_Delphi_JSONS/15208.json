I was hoping to be able to deploy and run the intake before retracting then continuing to run the motors for about a second after the deploy command is called. I initially thought to do this via a Thread.sleep() call but was told this would lock the robot code(even though I’m pretty sure each command call can get threaded) my idea is as follows\n\nIn Intake subsystem:\n\nThen schedule it as so:\n\nWould this only cause a sleep to occur for the current command or would this hold up the entire scheduler, including stuff like driving.\n\nAnother way which I was sort of able to get working but ran into the issue that while it would delay as intended it wouldn’t allow the command to be rescheduled until the delay was finished(basically the delay command couldn’t be interupted)\n\nFloorIntake :\n\nscheduled as so:",
