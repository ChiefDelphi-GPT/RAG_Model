Instead of needing to manually face a direction, you could just hold down a button and the robot would turn for you while moving back from the other side of the field. We also had a button to switch between field centric and robot centric field view, which was helpful when lining up at the stage to climb. I’d love other similar ideas on what we could add to our swerve drivebase to help our drivers out for next season.",

We also didn’t toggle the intake in or out, the driver had to hold the trigger down for the intake to deploy. It would override the trigger once a game piece was picked up.  We instituted a pulse on the intake rollers to somewhat auto center the game piece in our intake. Also when climbing the operator had to hold down the button to extend the elevator and once the button was let go of the robot would climb. Like I said pretty simple stuff but it did make a difference for us.",

If a note was completely out of the driver’s view (i.e., pressed against the alliance wall), the operator could press a button, and it would automatically drive to and intake the note using a custom vision model running on a LL3 with a coral.  Later in the season, we added a button that rotates to the note and intakes it, but doesn’t drive, allowing for the same aim assist capability, without ever having to take control of the drivetrain away from the driver.",

This guy is an absolute GOAT.\n\nWe didn’t want to pay for a ChArUco calibration board, but, had an old iPad Pro lying around. So, we made a calibrating tool that’s web based that can be used on the device resulting in a mean error of less than 0.3px!! image 2160×1620 63.4 KB\n\nimage 2160×1620 63.4 KB\n\nimage 2160×1620 63.4 KB\n\nMade a camera intrinsics calibration tool that can be used against a phone camera\n\nWe wanted a fast and accurate way of checking the field AprilTag positions against what was provided in the manual without having the robot present. We came up with a solution that uses a phone with a really good camera (an iPhone, any modern day phone camera should do).\n\nimage 1073×1085 115 KB\n\nimage 1073×1085 115 KB\n\nimage 1073×1085 115 KB\n\nA video would be recorded for post-processing that would include the speaker AprilTags in view. We’d “pin” one of the speaker AprilTags and use that as a reference to then calculate the relative position to all of the other tags in view. Multiple videos can be stitched together, eventually resulting in an updated field map that could be dumped into PhotonVision (we had one for Limelight, but, switched to PV mid-season)\n\nHere’s our open sourced projects for the stuff referenced above:\n\nContribute to TheHolyCows/cowlibration-board development by creating an account on GitHub.\n\nhttps://theholycows.github.io/cowlibration-board/application/\n\nContribute to TheHolyCows/cowlibration-camera development by creating an account on GitHub.\n\nContribute to TheHolyCows/cowlibration-field development by creating an account on GitHub.\n\n(edit, @'d the guy)",

In previous years, our drivers had to mainly do everything on their own (including extension, lineup, pickup, etc.), but switching to all NEO’s (for the encoders), allowed us to automate most of the driver’s tasks.\n\nWe made it so that when our driver presses and holds down a button, our robot will automatically approach, lineup, extend and score and retract without our driver having to do anything. We felt that we had to do it because of some of the bad sightlines on the field from things like the stage and speaker.\n\nWe tried to fully automate the intaking process as well (near source), but without a beam-break sensor, trying to detect when a note was inserted was tricky, however making the lining up process automatic was better than having our drivers do it by hand.",

In this case, the source tags were further outside of the field than expected. This difference could lead to inconsistent behavior where shots are less accurate when certain tags are in view of the camera, but by calibrating the tag positions on the field we can account for this.",

You’ve got it set up as basically a Structure from Motion problem, right?\n\nCurrently it’s setup as a pose graph optimization problem that works off the relative 3D poses computed from OpenCV’s solvePnP(), so in a sense it’s “unaware” of the pose ambiguity problem. It might be better to setup the solver to minimize reprojection error instead, and have it work off each tag’s 2D image points.\n\nEmilTheMeal:\n\nWhat solver is this?

The factor graph stuff I’m playing with uses them, and it’s kind of awesome how at least for localization it handles changing trust with range and ambiguity for free as part of the model. I’m using gtsam, but at the end of the day it’s just a LM solver in a trench coat, so doing the same thing in ceres should be possible. Curious to hear how this changes results if you do decide trying the pixel coordinate observation formulation instead!",
