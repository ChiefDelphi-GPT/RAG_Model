                    "cooked": "There are a few things to unpack here, but in general it is definitely possible for a RIO 1 to run moderately complex projects like this. I know of several teams running variations of this example project on the RIO 1 without issue.\n\ncatrix:\n\nduring the first 10 seconds after the robot boots, the program is very laggy\n\nThis is to be expected with almost any Java robot project, since the JVM needs to warm up. How long the loop times take to settle down depends on the project and the GC settings you use, but anywhere from 10 to 30 seconds (as well as shortly after the first enable) is typical.\n\ncatrix:\n\neven the closed loops for swerve steers will shake\n\nAs a slight tangent, the AdvantageKit project is set up to run PID controllers on the RIO rather than the motor controllers. This is absolutely a viable control scheme (we ran it with no issues on our 2023 competition robot ), but running control loops on the motor controller can improve stability in case of loop overruns. The AdvantageKit project is only intended to be used as a starting point, and there are many examples of teams running on-controller PID with AdvantageKit.\n\nIf you’re only seeing this issue while the JVM is still warming up, I wouldn’t worry about it much though.\n\ncatrix:\n\nBut the CPU time still goes to above 20 milli-seconds sometimes\n\nOccasional loop overruns in the ~20-40ms range generally aren’t an issue. When analyzing loop overruns, I find it particularly helpful to use AdvantageScope’s statistics tab . For example, here are the loop cycle times (the “full” loop cycle) during one of our 2024 Einstein matches:\n\nScreenshot 2024-07-26 at 12.54.53 PM 1894×528 38.7 KB\n\nScreenshot 2024-07-26 at 12.54.53 PM 1894×528 38.7 KB\n\nThe vast majority of loop cycles are in the 8ms to 13ms range, and the 99% percentile is 12.4ms. However, we have regular spikes above 20ms without issue:\n\nScreenshot 2024-07-26 at 12.55.59 PM 2290×1000 187 KB\n\nScreenshot 2024-07-26 at 12.55.59 PM 2290×1000 187 KB\n\nGenerally loop overruns are only an issue if they are very large or occurring on a significant portion of cycles. Ultimately, it depends whether they actually affect the robot’s functionality (as I said before, running on-RIO PID makes the code a bit more sensitive). If you aren’t seeing issues as a result of the occasional ~30ms overrun, there’s no reason to be concerned about it; this is usually the stance we take with our competition code.\n\ncatrix:\n\nmy terminal just keeps telling me look time over-run\n\nThe current system that WPILib uses to report loop overruns unfortunately lacks subtly in conveying which overruns are critical or not. Flooding the console with every overrun is not particularly helpful to the user, since most of these warnings can be safely ignored (for the reasons I just described). We are working on alternatives that will improve this experience in future years.",
