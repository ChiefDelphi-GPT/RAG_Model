                    "cooked": "Hello, we are trying to aim our robot to an angle based on the apriltag number. The issue we are having is that sometimes (more like occasionally) it works fine but other times when it goes to zero it actually goes to 180. This is the code we have so far.  From the print values, The target angle and current angle are both correct. It just goes to 180 instead of 0 degrees. I suspect its some problem with the continuous output but I can not put my finger on what. We have tried using FieldCentricFacingAngle swerve control instead but we can not make it rotate while stationary. If someone knows how to do that instead that would also be helpful.

Since some of those issues may affect other parts of your code, I’ve listed all the ones I see below.\n\nYou are constructing a PIDController every loop, which is bad because it resets state information. You instead want to construct a PIDController once at the start of the command and reuse it across loops.\n\ngetRotation3d() will not reflect the actual heading of the robot according to odometry, as that is the raw Rotation3d from the Pigeon 2. Instead, the heading can be found as part of the pose: getState().Pose.getRotation() .\n\nYou are also constructing a new SwerveRequest every loop, which can lead to GC pressure and loop overruns. We recommend caching and reusing those objects (same with regular motor control requests).\n\nUsing a FieldCentricFacingAngle request is very similar to the regular FieldCentic . The only differences are you need to set the PID constants on construction, and you provide the target heading instead of rotational rate. A simple command-based example is shown below.\n\nThat command can then easily be scheduled in RobotContainer:\n\nNote that if your target april tag is not constant, you will want aprilTurn to take a Supplier<...> instead.\n\nWe have tried using FieldCentricFacingAngle swerve control instead but we can not make it rotate while stationary.\n\nWhat exactly was the issue you were seeing? All you have to do to rotate in place is leave the X and Y velocities 0 and set the target heading.",

All you have to do to rotate in place is leave the X and Y velocities 0 and set the target heading.\n\nIt just was not rotating at all. We also did not try setting the PID values with the withPID function so I guess that might be the issue. I guess we just assumed there would be default ones and we assumed you needed the robot to move to actually get it to rotate since we were not successful in doing so. We will try that tomorrow.\n\nThank you for the other suggestions for the different issues you observed. We will implement them tomorrow as well.
