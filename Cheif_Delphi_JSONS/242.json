I’m a programmer on a relatively new FRC team, and this offseason, we want to implement Flutter to create a framework that communicates directly with our robot. So, I have a few questions:\n\n1: Was it worth it? 2: What were the challenges? 3: How did you manage the communication between Flutter and the robot?\n\nCurrently, our understanding of Flutter is very basic, as we’re just starting out, so we only know a few things about Dart. I’d like to ask for the opinions of programmers who have already implemented Flutter at FRC . I’ll leave the base code for anyone interested to take a look. Thank you all in advance!\n\nGitHub - muriloMiranda404/flutter-test Contribute to muriloMiranda404/flutter-test development by creating an account on GitHub.\n\nContribute to muriloMiranda404/flutter-test development by creating an account on GitHub.",

The ability to develop “almost native” apps for multiple platforms is very useful when you have a small team.\n\nmurilo404:\n\nWhat were the challenges?\n\nMy team all know Java and Python so developing in Flutter was very easy. We did have a few problems around the project structure, but than can be resolved with better planning.\n\nmurilo404:\n\nHow did you manage the communication between Flutter and the robot?\n\nI believe that use can use nt4 library .

Was definitely worth it for us because its easier for us to change a ui than rebuild a physical button board.\n\n2). I have experience with flutter but our students didn’t, so it was a little more difficult to work on than if it was html based. Also for some reason our auto selector would work in the sim but not on the actual robot and we never got around to debugging it. I would also say that you should definitely get a grasp of the Stream Class due to how network tables are integrated.\n\n3). We were using the nt4 extension and it was pretty easy. It worked well for us. we had a helper class to reference the network table items on our robot code.\n\nto add another option, you can do all of this with the frc web components as well, and they have support for web frameworks. Not to steer away from flutter, as I personally enjoy working with it, but there are def other options if there’s an issue with familiarity. I have not used it at all, so I can’t personally comment on working with it.",
