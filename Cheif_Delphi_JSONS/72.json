                    "cooked": "I've seen a lot of people discussing **CAN** wiring. While many suggest the trunk-and-branch approach, it’s not ideal. With the upcoming release of a new control system, I wonder if they plan to use **CAN** FD. If they do, the trunk-and-branch method might face more issues.  \n\nAs a mentor, I’d like to promote a plug-and-play design philosophy for systems. I have some ideas for mechanical and programming solutions, which I may share in the future. For wiring, I’ve had an idea for some time but am unsure if it’s practical.\n\nMy idea involves creating a **CAN** hub, similar to a power distribution system. This hub would include a 120-ohm resistor and act as the terminator. It would connect to the Roborio controller and offer connection points for each device. Each connection would require four conductors (two sets of twisted pairs—one for incoming and one for outgoing signals). This setup would allow for a longer **CAN** loop while maintaining the daisy-chain functionality, avoiding issues typically seen with lengths over 40 meters.\n\nThis concept combines a star-like structure with a true daisy-chain bus. While this might simplify wiring, it retains the significant flaw of a single point of failure. My idea aims to address this by having the **CAN** hub perform a continuity check upon connection. If the loop detects a break, it would automatically disconnect the affected device until continuity is restored.\n\nAs a non-electrical engineer, I’m particularly concerned about two issues:  \n1. Can a continuity check be performed without disrupting the **CAN** signal?  \n2. Would replacing a failed device with a MOSFET affect the **CAN** signal integrity?\n\nI have tentative solutions for both, though neither is as seamless as adding a dedicated continuity check circuit. Adding extra wires for this purpose would mean more components and potential complications. For example, if a single **CAN** wire fails (not the continuity wire), the system could become inoperable. Additionally, using too many relays would make the hub bulky and heavy.\n\nI’m also considering using Ethernet connectors like the SWYFT, which could provide redundancy by monitoring continuity across all four wires. However, standard Ethernet cables aren’t ideal due to their lack of motion rating, though redundancy could mitigate this issue. My preferred solution is using 4-conductor cable with twisted pairs, terminated with crimped ferrules, and connected to the **CAN** hub via PCB-mounted WAGO connectors.\n\nA more advanced implementation could have the hub communicate as a **CAN** device, alerting the controller to disconnections. This would allow programmers to implement fail-safes for non-responsive devices.\n\nFeedback would be appreciated, especially if others find this idea feasible and worthwhile. If so, I’d welcome assistance in bringing it to fruition.  \n\nThank you,  \nBryant",

First, I’d look around to see if someone has implemented this feature set and what form it takes. Is it in one of the CAN (or similar bus) standards? In the datasheets of COTS CAN transceiver integrated circuits?\n\nI suspect that the switchable circuit would ideally have to be designed to look transparent to a signal passing through it (i.e., characteristic impedance matched) and non-reflective to a signal dead-ending at it (i.e., terminated). I’m not sure what that circuit would look like with a MOSFET inline, in addition to the mismatch between the 100 Ω characteristic impedance of the twisted pair network cable (e.g., category 5) and its RJ-style terminations, and the 120 Ω CAN transceivers.

                    "cooked": "Continuity detection versus signal integrity are critical considerations when monitoring CAN bus lines. To maintain accurate signals without loading the bus, high-impedance dividers or buffers paired with small bias networks can be used to check the differential voltage (around 2.5 V) between CAN_H and CAN_L. This setup helps identify breaks in the bus communication. Additionally, the sensing network must have significantly higher impedance than the 60 Ω termination to prevent timing skew or idle level shifts.\n\nWhen selecting switching elements, MOSFETs often have minimal on-resistance (around 5 mΩ), making them suitable for low-impedance applications. However, their parasitic capacitances can cause signal reflections, particularly at higher data rates in CAN FD up to 8 Mbit/s. For better performance, analog switches or relay drivers with lower capacitance are recommended.\n\nThe choice of bus topology should be carefully considered. A star configuration with controlled bypasses works well if only one node is inserted between hubs at a time. If a hub fails, redundancy measures like having two hubs or a watchdog circuit are necessary to maintain connectivity. Commercial CAN bus couplers and isolators, such as the NXP TJA1441 or Microchip MCP2562, provide effective solutions for isolating faulty segments and maintaining bus integrity.\n\nWhen choosing connectors, Ethernet (RJ45) offers cost-effectiveness but lacks durability and vibration resistance, whereas M8/M12 connectors are ideal for industrial environments due to their screw-locking, vibration-proof design. Using a fifth pin for a spare pair ensures reliable continuity monitoring if a CAN wire breaks, allowing for additional features like low-current power or LED indicators.\n\nTo implement the system, consider using two 120 Ω terminators controlled by analog switches. A microcontroller, such as a small ARM Cortex-M device, can monitor CAN signals, control the switches, and report diagnostics. Firmware logic should include testing upon insertion, detecting signal drops during communication, and sending alerts through RoboRIO via CAN. Mechanically, the design should feature a robust PCB in a durable enclosure with WAGO or screw-terminal headers, and optionally use stranded wire with ferrules for improved durability.\n\nNext steps involve reviewing electrical specifications, prototyping a two-port CAN hub using off-the-shelf transceivers and analog muxes, and testing signal quality with an oscilloscope at different speeds to ensure reliability. Your approach is feasible and aligns with modern robotics competition needs, offering a scalable and reliable solution.",

The bypass detection circuit checks the CAN signals on each side of the loop. If one side is dominant and the other recessive for at least 1 bit time (>1 microsecond), the detector triggers. You might lose one CAN message when this happens, but it will automatically retry, making it survivable. Then, a relay or analog switch would disconnect the loop and bypass it. This requires six total switches—two for opening CANH and CANL on each side, plus two for bypassing. This can be achieved using one multipole relay per loop or with analog switches. Once disconnected or bypassed, a reset method would be needed, which could be manual or controlled by software. For N loops, you would need N detectors and bypass switches. Essentially, each detector would consist of two CAN transceivers in receive-only mode, along with simple comparison logic and a latch circuit to control the bypass switch.",

A single device malfunction would risk taking down everything downstream, making it essential to establish a priority order for the system. However, the main drawback is that you’d have to create a **CAN** (Controller Area Network) interface to integrate with the RoboRio, which involves additional learning and troubleshooting. While a simple device that manually checks signals and toggles relays or analog switches might seem easier now, setting up communication between the CANHUB and RoboRio could offer more flexibility in the future.",

                    "cooked": "Having ChatGPT join the conversation again, I plugged in Edward's response... It's an interesting challenge but solvable. The key requirement is that the hub must bypass a loop if it isn't passing CAN messages through it. The bypass detection circuit checks the CAN signals on each side of the loop. If one side sends a dominant signal while the other remains recessive for more than one bit-time (greater than 1 microsecond) at a rate of 1 Mbit/s, the detector triggers. This may cause the loss of one CAN message, but the system will automatically retry, making it survivable. To implement this, you would need six switches in total—one pair to open the CANH and another pair to open the CANL signals on each side of the loop, plus two more to enable the bypass. This can be achieved using either a multipole relay or analog switches, each requiring a compact design with fast operating times. Once the loop is bypassed, a reset mechanism is necessary. This could be implemented manually or via software. For multiple loops, you would need N detectors and corresponding bypass switches. Each detector would consist of two CAN transceivers in receive-only mode, along with simple logic to compare the received signals and a latching circuit to control the bypass switch.  \n\nFault detection works by monitoring the CAN bus on both sides of each stub using two receive-only CAN transceivers. If one side sends a dominant signal while the other remains recessive for longer than a bit-time (greater than 1 µs at 1 Mbit/s), the loop is considered faulty. This approach uses inherent CAN signal levels (dominant = 0, recessive = 1) without additional sense wires, preventing false trips due to spurious edges. However, synchronization of the detector clock to the CAN baud rate is crucial to ensure accurate detection within a safe bit-time window. At higher data rates, such as 8 Mbit/s, the 1 µs threshold may span multiple data-phase bits, so care must be taken to maintain reliable fault detection.  \n\nFor isolation and bypass switching, six throws are required per loop—two for opening the CANH and CANL signals on each side, plus two for enabling the bypass. Implementation options include using multipole relays, which provide galvanic isolation but may be slower, or high-speed analog switches with sub-50 ns settling times and low resistance, such as the ADG5412. Signal integrity must also be considered to avoid reflections or interference at the target data rate.  \n\nA latching circuit ensures the loop remains open once a fault is detected. This can be implemented using an SR latch or microcontroller GPIO. Reset strategies include a manual option with a field-serviceable button or a software-driven approach where a \"clear faults\" CAN frame instructs each hub to re-test and re-close healthy loops. Additionally, hubs can report faults or status updates, such as \"Loop #3 open\" or \"stuck fault,\" via CAN messages.  \n\nScaling to N ports involves replicating the detector and switch modules N times while managing MCU pin-count constraints through techniques like I²C GPIO expansion or daisy-chaining detector ASICs. Early selection of switch technology, simulation of detection logic on a CAN bus, prototyping one port with a combination of CAN transceivers, analog switches, and a small MCU, and developing a firmware API for fault clearing are recommended next steps.",
