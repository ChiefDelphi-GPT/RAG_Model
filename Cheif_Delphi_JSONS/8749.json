                    "cooked": "Allow me to introduce myself.\n\nI have been doing FIRST robotics since 1995.\n\nI am currently a mentor on Team 88, TJ-squared.\n\nI am also an engineer at Formlabs, a 3D printing company.\n\nI love all three. I wish that there was more overlap between these things I love.\n\nI am trying to fix that.\n\nI formed a group at my work called FormFRC to design parts that are (A) useful to FIRST FRC teams and (B) print super well on Formlabs Printers and/or in our materials.\n\nThis is the 1st post of what I plan to be many more (I have half dozen in the can and will post them as soon as I am able).\n\nPrint in Place Mini Omni and Vector wheels (1 3/8\" Diameter)\n\nYoutube videos (me yapping about the wheels)\n\nYoutube video of the wheels interacting with a Note\n\nGrabCAD with all the files (STEPs and STLs)\n\nSpace is always tight on a FIRST FRC robot. You need to move a Note or Cone or Cube or some such around you just can’t get it to center correctly.\n\nOmni Wheels and Vector Wheels are often your friend in such cases.\n\nBut you can’t get them because they are out of stock (too often) or even if they are in stock you just can’t fit those giant things you can buy.\n\nHow about let’s print some. 1 3/8\" OD rollers that you can batch process and get have as many as you’d want overnight?\n\nIt’s possible.  I was able to start a batch of 192 mini wheels printing last night and the were ready to roll on a robot (well, if TJ2 had a robot ready – we are still prototyping) by mid morning.\n\nThese wheels are not very grippy because they are hard Nylon12 plastic but the surface of the notes are grippy enough to allow them to function tolerably well.\n\nThe Omni Wheel is a 3 Roller with a 1/2\" hex drive, you can phase them to get effectively 6 rollers. 3WheelOmin 528×532 82.6 KB 3WheelOmniStackOfFive 773×579 164 KB\n\n3WheelOmin 528×532 82.6 KB\n\n3WheelOmin 528×532 82.6 KB\n\n3WheelOmniStackOfFive 773×579 164 KB\n\n3WheelOmniStackOfFive 773×579 164 KB\n\nThe Vector wheels come in 2 Basic Flavors. 6 Roller and 5 Roller. It is hard to judge a difference between their performance. I think the both run about the same.\n\nOne difference between them is that the 5 roller version only needs a Right and a Left because you can vary the phasing between adjacent wheels in 12 deg increments (360/5 - 360/60) by just putting the wheel on the shaft at a different spot on the hex shaft.\n\nBUT… that doesn’t work for a 6 roller version. If you rotate the wheel on the hex shaft you get the same phasing, so you can’t make the nice “chevron” shape that seems to work best. If you want that you have to have multiple versions of the Right and Left hand vector wheels. I have made 2 flavors of each hand so that there are 4 versions of the 6 roller vector wheel.\n\nNote that we initially had the notes being driven from only one roller (pushing them along the table top) and that worked a lot less well at centering the note.\n\n192VectorWheelsReadyToRoll ABABABABABAB 1920×3413 679 KB 192VectorWheels      BeingSifted 1920×1080 302 KB 192VectorWheels     AboutToBeBlasted1 1920×3413 476 KB 192VectorWheels   AboutToBeBlasted2 1920×1080 261 KB 192VectorWheels  BeingBlasted 1920×1080 215 KB 192VectorWheelsReadyToRoll AAAA BBBB BBBB AAAA 1920×3413 677 KB\n\n192VectorWheelsReadyToRoll ABABABABABAB 1920×3413 679 KB\n\n192VectorWheelsReadyToRoll ABABABABABAB 1920×3413 679 KB\n\n192VectorWheels      BeingSifted 1920×1080 302 KB\n\n192VectorWheels      BeingSifted 1920×1080 302 KB\n\n192VectorWheels     AboutToBeBlasted1 1920×3413 476 KB\n\n192VectorWheels     AboutToBeBlasted1 1920×3413 476 KB\n\n192VectorWheels   AboutToBeBlasted2 1920×1080 261 KB\n\n192VectorWheels   AboutToBeBlasted2 1920×1080 261 KB\n\n192VectorWheels  BeingBlasted 1920×1080 215 KB\n\n192VectorWheels  BeingBlasted 1920×1080 215 KB\n\n192VectorWheelsReadyToRoll AAAA BBBB BBBB AAAA 1920×3413 677 KB\n\n192VectorWheelsReadyToRoll AAAA BBBB BBBB AAAA 1920×3413 677 KB\n\nIf you want to dig into the CAD the Onshape files are public: PrintInPlaceMiniOmni PrintInPlaceVectorRoller (5 wheel flavor is on a different branch – check the versions, you’ll find it)\n\nI hope people find this interesting and useful.\n\nCheers, Dr. Joe J.",

I had some problems with printing similar projects/wheels in PA11 due to the thermal characteristics of melting/sintering the material but I was using SAF technology. Curious is the problem translates over to the more conventional SLS technology as well.\n\nI believe that powder-based processes are best suited to the FRC environment (compared to material extrusion & vat photopolymerization) and I’d love to see a more economical way of introducing these parts to teams. Are you aware of any service bureaus currently operating the Fuse1?",

                    "cooked": "I have indeed tried Nylon11 but it was Nylon11 CF (Carbon Fiber). They worked great but I think the better surface quality of on CF parts allow the rollers to spin with a little less friction (it is hard to tell by my hand but I THINK that the Nylon12 versions roll a little easier). I have not tried unfilled Nylon11 but I expect that it would be quite similar to Nylon12.\n\nAs to SLS for FIRST teams, it is a game changer. We basically never buy pulleys any more, preferring to print whatever we need, almost certainly printing it attached to whatever it is driving rather than having the torque transfer to a shaft and then back to whatever the next stage.\n\nAs I have said before Formlabs employees have “infinite prints” as a perk of employment. I almost never print in anything other than SLS since the Fuse1 has been available.\n\nCheers, Dr. Joe J.",

The surface finish and accuracy is significantly better compared to FDM and as long as it is used for a low-torque application we haven’t had any issues. Our alphabot is using 3D printed 24t pulleys for driving our flywheels 1:1 off of 2 Neo Vortex’s without issue. While we’re using ST45 from BASF, I’d imagine Tough 2000 from Formlabs would work just as well.\n\nFor FTC we use resin parts as competition parts, for FRC we tend to keep them to our prototypes and alphabots as we’re not as confident they’ll survive a hard hit, compared to the same components out of metal. We didn’t have much of a chance to do testing on our resin materials before the season started.\n\nIMG_0831 1920×1440 358 KB\n\nIMG_0831 1920×1440 358 KB\n\nIMG_0831 1920×1440 358 KB",
