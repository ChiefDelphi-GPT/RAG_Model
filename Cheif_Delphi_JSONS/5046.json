I haven’t found one, and if anyone else wants to use this thread to post their own assorted parts, very last minute, feel free)\n\nI’m an alum of 948, but I’ve been doing design work over the past couple of months on my own. The chances of this getting used in-season are low, but just in case, here’s all of the stuff I’d like to share for R303 reasons.\n\nKeep in mind I’ve built exactly none of these, so I have no idea what real-world constraints exist on these. That said, feel free to ask questions or give comments or feedback.\n\nBased off of TTB and FRCDesign’s 2 stage cascade , this one aims to be a little more compact (and cheaper). The continuous designs were going to be some sort of cable-driven system, but I never finished it.\n\nFeatures:\n\nConfigurable width, height, stage count, rigging type, and more\n\nUses REV’s new End Mount Bearing Blocks ( SDS bearing blocks work too)\n\nUses TTB ’s chain mount blocks and dyneema pulleys\n\nRatchet-based cable tensioning system\n\nimage 521×784 76.9 KB\n\nimage 521×784 76.9 KB\n\nimage 521×784 76.9 KB\n\nNRG will be using something similar to this in 2025, game pending. This version is very based on 3847’s 2024 CAD (as in, nearly every major dimension is from their endcaps). Plenty of other configurable rollers exist at this point, I just like having my own, and I do think there are a few advantages.\n\nFeatures/Major differences from 3847:\n\nThe same endcap is compatible with both 3847-style and stub hex\n\nConfigurable to pulleys, 2 (ish) different gear types, polycord, and nothing\n\nConfigurable length, endcaps, and more\n\nimage 1288×126 36.4 KB\n\nimage 1288×126 36.4 KB\n\nimage 1288×126 36.4 KB\n\nNot much to say here. Generally things to make my life easier, and not have to fiddle with so many knobs and dials when importing pulleys and gears. Also, a fair number of COTS items with minor changes. image 791×561 60.4 KB image 718×517 51.9 KB\n\nimage 791×561 60.4 KB\n\nimage 791×561 60.4 KB\n\nimage 718×517 51.9 KB\n\nimage 718×517 51.9 KB\n\nA parts-studio based drivebase (and bumper, and layout sketch) generator. This is useful because it allows for bellypan or tube modifications, additional crossbars, or anything else. The downside is it adds a lot of redundant entries to Onshape’s BOM, but I thin that’s a reasonable tradeoff. It only supports Mk4is, with a hole-filled bellypan, though it’s not impossible to add others.\n\nFeatures:\n\nConfigurable dimensions, tube types, and bellypan options\n\nSmall, built-in origin cube (shoutout to the FRCDesign people for the featurescript )\n\nimage 1168×699 77.1 KB\n\nimage 1168×699 77.1 KB\n\nimage 1168×699 77.1 KB\n\nI hope this is helpful to someone. If not, thanks for reading to the end!",

The pulley is just TTB ’s ELEV-PULLEY-002 (currently out of stock), for whatever it’s worth. The block for that is custom.\n\nTeam6928:\n\nhow can I use these files in my own designs?\n\nThe most straightforward way, if you’re not looking to make changes, is to use the “Insert” menu in Assemblies, then click “Other Documents”, and you should be able to find this doc under your Recently Opened. From there, you can insert the 0. Elevator assembly with whatever settings you want (note it may take a moment to load in). image 1670×986 186 KB\n\nimage 1670×986 186 KB\n\nimage 1670×986 186 KB\n\nAll that said, I wouldn’t base your season around this. Besides cost, and a minor space saving, there isn’t a huge benefit to this over TTB ’s. The thing I am most worried about is these custom pulley blocks - the easiest way to make them is 3d printing them, but I have no idea how they’ll hold, even if made of something like Nylon-CF. If they were Aluminum, I wouldn’t worry, given it’s very similar to TTB ’s. image 924×604 57.6 KB\n\nimage 924×604 57.6 KB\n\nimage 924×604 57.6 KB",
