Driving works fine, however using odometry isn’t.\n\nHere is a log explaining the title: (Ignore the large distance values, drive encoders not calibrated) image 724×102 1.5 KB\n\nimage 724×102 1.5 KB\n\nimage 724×102 1.5 KB\n\nSome of the wheels’ angles can be reversed, often 1 or more. When there are two swerve modules that have a reversed angle from the others, calling the update method on odometry doesn’t work properly. Not optimizing the swerve angle helps this problem since all modules will move to the same angle but the problem is still bound to arise.\n\nI’d expect the pose X value to be around 76000, but since the back_left motor is rotated by pi, the odometry calculation seems to think it’s driving in the opposite direction.\n\nIn order to prove this theory I set all Rotation2d’s to 0deg including gyro angle. I drove forward 1 meter and the angle of 2 modules was 0 while the others were pi. This meant the Pose2d of the robot was calculated as 0. When I manually turned the 2 modules, the odometry calculation seemed to work fine.\n\nHere’s the result of that test:\n\nIf I manually rotated the front_right and back_right modules then the x position would be correct.\n\nHas anyone else ran into this problem? I’ve looked at many swerve implementations. The one I’m using is based off the max swerve example (Python) My own implementation as well as this one have the same problem, the only difference is the robot has Falcon (TalonFX) motors rather than Neos.",

Optimize doesn’t have anything to do with odometry itself, it just changes wheel positions which would in turn affect the odometry position. The rotation encoders are fine and they return the expected angles perfectly on [0,2pi]. Module heading offsets should be ok since driving works fine, however when I used the same offsets as the example I had to subtract pi from the front left and back right modules as well as change the order that SwerveDrive4Kinematics.toSwerveModuleStates returns the modules. Maybe that’s an issue… I’ll investigate it but it doesn’t make sense to me how that would cause an issue if I’m able to drive just fine.\n\nDo you think using 2022 SwerveDriveOdometry would help my case if I could use it?",

That function only exists in SwerveModuleState, and SwerveDriveOdometry doesn’t use SwerveModuleState.\n\nSylent:\n\nModule heading offsets should be ok since driving works fine, however when I used the same offsets as the example I had to subtract pi from the front left and back right modules as well as change the order that SwerveDrive4Kinematics.toSwerveModuleStates returns the modules.\n\nYea, make sure the module order stays consistent.\n\nSylent:\n\nDo you think using 2022 SwerveDriveOdometry would help my case if I could use it?\n\nI doubt it.",
