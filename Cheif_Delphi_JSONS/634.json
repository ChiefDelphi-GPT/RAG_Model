                    "cooked": "To celebrate the start of summer Dephi, I’d like to complain about every major CAD software developer not porting their old software into the internet age.\n\nHere’s my argument: Established CAD programs like SolidWorks, Inventor and Creo lack basic cloud features, but those are the only major downsides to those programs. The “innovative” new CAD programs from the developers of each of those old CAD programs (Onshape, Fusion and 3DExperience) , solve the collaboration and cloud storage issues (to varying degrees) but also overhaul aspects of the CAD process that were never broken. The lack of cloud features in old CAD drives people to the new programs, but the those new programs are more limited in capability and needlessly reorganized.\n\nSo what are the old programs missing that I think is driving to shift to Onshape? (I don’t think the others are really gaining much traction) File sharing, easy cross-platform file viewing, and browser based editing.\n\nFile sharing: Simple to use cloud file storage and systems to avoid the overwriting of work. There are 3rd party solutions each with their own flaws and the CAD developers have their own systems, but there is nothing simple and built in, so at best it is a second program to install on each computer and manage. As a professional Solidworks user by far the best user experience was with Solidworks PDM, it is well integrated into both Solidworks and windows explorer. After setup you don’t notice it except for when people forget to check in files, and it works flawlessly. But setting it up requires you to have your own server and every CAD computer has to have SQL client, making it prohibitively difficult and expensive for any organization without an IT department to setup and maintain the server, and help CAD users setup their clients. The free third party options are buggy and have limited or no integration with either Windows Explorer or Solidworks, so they add extra steps to upload and download files from a separate program. As far as I’m aware the situation is pretty much the same for Inventor and probably Creo. My design engineering company has been contracted by clients just to setup PDM for customers whose IT departments couldn’t figure it out.\n\nCross-platform file viewing: Robotics teams want everyone to be able to easily look at CAD on whatever devices they have as hand, and without ever creating drawing packages. This is increasingly common in the professional world too, though most companies still rely on 2D drawings for standard parts or products. For the moment I’m just talking about viewing, and I think that you should be able to share a link to share to let anyone access CAD in a browser of phone app. This seems like it should be pretty easy to implement.\n\nBrowser based editing: I think this is the least important of the 3 basic cloud features, but it is a huge asset in education where people are likely using computers that were not purchased with CAD in mind.\n\nNow why don’t I like the new cloud native CAD offerings? The short answer is they are trying to make some new platform and rethink how CAD is done when CAD was never broken. Not all of my critiques apply to every newer CAD program, but many apply across several.\n\nUI: The UIs try to be sleek so they don’t use labels or tool ribbon tabs. But this just means that tools are harder to identify, icons are smaller so you can fit more into the single ribbon, and more drop down menus are needed for basic features because there isn’t enough room in one ribbon.\n\nLimited feature set: The tool sets are just a little more limited in some areas like reference geometry, surface modeling, assembly mates and other odd ball stuff. Not enough to cause big problems designing parts but enough to miss them if you’re used to having them. Not having reference planes in Onshape assemblies is particularly frustrating.\n\nUnderlying math is obscured: Features are less connected with the basic math underlying the models. Dimensions cannot contain equations directly. The mates are based on types of joint instead of geometric conditions. Features hide their underlying shapes instead of generating editable sketches and dimensions. Using more mathematical language makes the behavior of features less ambiguous, because the math is more rigorous than engineering terms.\n\nScope creep: Newer CAD programs try to integrate more features than just CAD. I’m not just talking about CAM or FEA, I’m talking about task boards, messaging, and PLM. Don’t force users into your ecosystem, let them choose their own communications platform, task board, CAM, FEA, etc. It’s fine to have some of these features as long as they are easily ignored or preferably, easily disabled. I’ve worked for managers who like to use email, slack, and half a dozen “productivity” apps and you end up spending all your time checking for messages or assignments across all the platforms. Let the users use CAD without navigating through other stuff.\n\nFile structures: Most of all, there was nothing wrong with having discrete files with different file types for each part, assembly, drawing and reference file. When you’re designing a part you don’t need to do it in the context of the assembly. Often times parts are shared between totally different products, or need to be sent to vendors who should not have access to the entire design. Having a single document type with tabs for part design, assembly, and drawings is just and extra layer of complexity for no reason. What CAD designer thought: “you know what really ticks me off? Having an assembly file that is focused on assembly tools and a part file that is focused on modeling tools.” ? It’s not like you can’t edit parts from the assembly, or draw multiple bodies in a single part file when you have a need.\n\nWhat I want is a simple cloud file storage system built into Solidworks (or inventor) with a browser and phone viewer app. If Dassault made that, it would fill the needs of most of the companies and many of the teams that I have seen switch from Solidworks to Onshape. I they made a true browser based Solidworks with the same features and same file types as regular Solidworks, I think it would outcompete Onshape and every other cloud native CAD on the market. I haven’t met a single engineer who prefers modeling in Onshape or 3DExperience or Fusion to their older counterparts, only people who prefer convenient cloud storage and browser based functionality.",

There are far too many examples of a browser based shell of the software that has the same name but no where near a comparable level of functionality.\n\nI also always think about the comparison between Microsoft Word as desktop native and Google Docs as cloud native. Word still remains more powerful with regard to pure word processing, but when they tried to give it cloud features it made the word we have today: clunky collaboration, comments that add weird spaces in the text, unreliable onedrive integration. While it cannot be known for sure, I suspect that some of these problems (especially the comments) are a result of retrofitting a software to do things it was not designed to do in the first place and therefore not having the optimal infrastructure.",

Also, because it compresses the SolidWorks files like crazy it makes it pretty easy to share the eDrawing files to others, and it also has some nice features for those interested, like making so that the people viewing the file woulden’t be able to measure things or importing parts from the file as STL. And for the experience itself, it’s really similar to the SolidWorks interface ( in terms of measuring and more). The desktop app is for free but the iPhone version costs like 5 dollars, not something that’ll stop you from purchasing it if you like it. Anyways, sorry for being a little off the topic with this, but I just think that if anyone hasn’t checked it out already, it’ll might be worth a try.",

Also, the market is really hard for new entrants, both because CAD programs are difficult to write, so you need a lot of experts, and because the minimum viable product is very large because most of the money is in commercial users already using an existing program.\n\nIt’s actually pretty surprising to me that onshape was successful.",

If their FEA tools can’t do all of 2D elements, hexehedral elements, give you appropriate mesh control, run basic non-linear analysis, and run transient analysis, its useless as an FEA package as its missing some of the most essential features and my answer would be “Go learn ansys or some other dedicated FEA package where you actually do the things you want to do”. To my knowledge, Solidworks has unusuably bad mesh controls while Onshape is missing 2d analysis, non-linear analysis, and multiple mesh controls.",
