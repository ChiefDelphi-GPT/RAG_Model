                    "cooked": "Hello everyone!\n\nTeam 1678 Citrus Circuits is excited to announce that we are partnering with First Updates Now to host a CADathon using the Game Design Challenge-winning game Storm Surge! The event will start at 6 p.m. on Friday, September 24, and end at 9 p.m. Sunday, October 3rd (Note that all times listed in this post are in EST). DO NOT START until the start date! Crucial judging criteria that will fundamentally determine the design of your robot will not be released before then.\n\nThe Storm Surge CADathon is sponsored by West Coast Products . They will be providing prizes for the top 3 winners!\n\nThe live show will feature a panel of judges from Team 1678. Follow First Updates Now (FUN) on Twitch to make sure you don’t miss any live streams.\n\nExplanation:\n\nA CADathon is similar to a Hackathon but involves designing robots online (CAD-ing robots). Participants are given a short period of time to CAD a robot and a panel of judges selects a winner based on predetermined judging criteria. For more information on how CADathons typically look, see F4 CADathons.\n\nTeam information:\n\nThe duration of the CADathon is nine (9) days (Friday to Sunday).\n\nThere will be no limit to CADathon team size IF everyone on the CADathon team is a member of the same FIRST (FRC, etc.) team.\n\nFor CADathon teams with members of different FIRST teams, we will keep the usual rule of “up to 3 members” (this is to prevent the 10 best CADathon participants from 10 different teams from teaming up and creating an unfair competition).\n\nIf you are competing solo, but would like to be assigned up to 2 random partners, you can sign up as a “random” in the signup form and we will do our best to match you with a partner that uses the same software and is in a similar time zone.\n\nSubmission requirements:\n\nAn exported STEP or Parasolid file, or Onshape link, native CAD files, and any renders they choose to create to a grabCAD workbench.\n\nA Written Submission to explain their design to the judging panel.\n\nAll files and Written Submission must be submitted by October 3rd at 9 p.m. EST. Note that all files will be inspected to ensure adherence to game rules.\n\nJudging Process:\n\nAll submissions will be split into groups and each judge will judge a portion of the submissions. Each judge will then submit their top five (5) or so teams, and the other judges will go back and judge those entries. This way the top teams will have feedback from all of the judges, and all teams will have detailed feedback from at least one (1) judge.\n\nPrerequisites:\n\nThe only prerequisites to join are that you are willing to spend time designing and that you have access to CAD software. Participants of all ages are welcome (this is not limited to students) and we encourage everyone from rookies to the most advanced CADers to put their skills to the test. If you are new to CAD and would like to be on a larger team to help yourself learn, please contact us using the discord below.\n\nRegistration:\n\nThe deadline for registration is September 24th at 12 p.m. EST. Late registration is allowed, but please sign up as soon as possible.\n\nRegardless of the type of team you are (solo, 3-person, FIRST team, etc.), only ONE (1) member of each team should complete [the registration form].( https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1OMC4c4OvnrqWueWa9W_XV37CM_0LCkn0WRhtXG_e9tM/edit?usp=sharing ).\n\nDiscord:\n\nBe sure to join our Discord server to stay up to date with Q&A and interact with other CADathon participants! If you have any questions, contact us in the Discord server or at strategy@citruscircuits.org .\n\nWe can’t wait to start the CADathon!",

The LigerBots 2877’s Storm Surge robot is named Atelís (greek for “incomplete”).\n\nimage 907×786 110 KB\n\nimage 907×786 110 KB\n\nimage 907×786 110 KB\n\nEarly in our design process we decided to forget about shooting into the high goal. We would get 42 points for scoring four times on the cache and once in the low goal, while the same routine with a high goal would get us 48 points. We decided that being able to efficiently score on the cache and low goal would make up for the small loss in points for skipping the high goal.\n\nIn order to reduce cycle times, we made the following design choices:\n\nLightweight, low center of mass robot that can go under the uplink\n\nDouble jointed arm that reaches the low goal, cache, and feeder intake on either side\n\nSpring powered roller claw that can pick up donuts that aren’t centered on the robot\n\nElectromagnet on the intake to pull down the chain\n\nChain in tube West Coast Drive for weight and feasibility\n\nimage 1448×729 221 KB\n\nimage 1448×729 221 KB\n\nimage 1448×729 221 KB\n\nWe wanted to have a climber on this robot, but we ran out of time. Although a suction climber was tempting, we knew from 2019 that it would be challenging to pull off and would impact our feasibility score. We opted for a similar arm curl concept, except using a  ratcheting latch for leverage. There would have been two latches on either side of the arm. This screenshot has a poorly placed pivot point but it’s possible to design it such that the robot can drive underneath the uplink while the climber is stowed.\n\nHow the robot would climb image 1055×690 81.8 KB\n\nimage 1055×690 81.8 KB\n\nimage 1055×690 81.8 KB\n\nHow the latch would close\n\nOnshape workflow with master sketches in a main document and importing versions of mechanisms from other documents works quite well (the whole robot renders in < 0.5s)\n\nWe should have started drivetrain CAD right away\n\nThe intake and arm probably should have been simplified to score on the same side which would allow us to couple the climber\n\nWe should have prioritized CADing the climber quickly\n\nNext time we will try to engage more rookies in the design process\n\nCAD electronics sooner",
