                    "cooked": "I noticed quite a few teams recently are running into an issue that I’m all too familiar with and I promised a few folks I would post this.  I suspect this post will unintentionally ruffle someones feathers for some reason but I hope it doesn’t.  I hope teams are able to read it and figure out some of the issues they have been having.\n\nThe problem: So, you’re connecting your RoboRIO to your OpenMesh OM5P and you have a LimeLight or LemonLumen or PhotonCam or Jetson or Pi or whatever and you are connecting it to the second port when…\n\nSometimes, you boot up your 'bot and your co-processor just doesn’t connect.  You check the radio and it’s up.  You check the RoboRIO and it’s working.  You then try running a ping command to your visionWidget and it doesn’t work.  You verify it is powered but it just isn’t connected.  Your next step is probably rebooting the robot, or unplugging a cable and replugging it, maybe replacing a cable.  Sometimes that works… in fact, you probably blame the cable or blame a bad radio after you swap it to a new one.\n\n2 or 3 matches later, it comes back.  You dismiss it as gremlins and then swap another cable or something else and you keep scratching your head to the point of trepanning.\n\nNote that some of these sections are “hidden” and you need to click the twisty to display them.\n\nIntermittently, something plugged into the second port on the OpenMesh OM5P radio just can’t be reached from the RoboRIO.  Rebooting the robot might fix it but it eventually comes back.  It’s not predictable, it’s intermittent.  It only happens when you seem to be putting blue bumpers on your robot or when the safety captain programs the radios.  It’s intermittent.  You’ve probably correlated it to something because that’s what humans do.\n\nWell, it did.  My first encounter with this bug was back in 2017.  In fact, there was a Team Update in 2017 around Week 1 or Week 2 of competition season that enabled teams to use a switch connected to one port with the RoboRIO plugged into the switch instead of directly into the radio.  Ever since then, I’ve been aware of it and I’ve tried to keep up with patches for it.  As far as I know, all of the patches are in the current radio firmware we are using but it still seems to happen.\n\nMy best guess is that some update to your visionWidget is likely causing the timings to be different on the bringup of the ports and negotiation of the link speed and it is more common and more frequent suddenly.  Like a creepy clown hiding in a sewer, it’s been there since the beginning.\n\nExecutive Summary: The Qualcomm QCA955x (QCA9557 and QCA9558) chipset that exists within both the OM5P-AN and OM5P-AC Radios sometimes has a bug where the chipset and the ethernet interface do not come up as expected.  It results from a link state change (is a device connected or not) or from a link speed change (ethernet supported speed auto-negotiation).  No one seems to know what causes this and there are quite a few patches to the OpenWRT project ( https://openwrt.org ), the Gluon project ( Welcome to Gluon — Gluon 2023.1.1 documentation ), and a few others to try and resolve it.\n\nThis is going to get ugly and a bit hand-wavey for some folks.  The QCA955x is a System on Chip (SoC) from Qualcomm.  It does not include any method to connect to wireless systems or anything to allow it to directly connect to ethernet ports.  For those we need a wireless chipset as well as physical ethernet interface chipsets.  These physical ethernet chipsets are sometimes called PHYs and they come in quite a few “media independent” flavors: Media-independent interface - Wikipedia\n\nSo now we get to the good part and I’m just going to quote from some development mailing list sources here:\n\nThis commit adds a workaround for the loss of the SGMII link observed on the QCA955x generation of SoCs. The workaround originates part from the U-Boot source code, part from the implementation from AVM found in the GPL tarball for the AVM FRITZ!WLAN Repeater 450E.\n\nThe bug results in a stuck SGMII link between the PHY device and the SoC side. This has only been observed with the Atheros AR8033 PHY and most likely all devices using such combination are affected.\n\nIt is worked around by reading a hidden SGMII status register and issuing a SGMII PHY reset until the link becomes useable again.\n\n[OpenWrt-Devel,2/4] ath79: add QCA955x SGMII link loss workaround - Patchwork\n\nand another:\n\nThe SGMII link of the QCA955x seems to be unstable when the PHY changes the link speed. Reseting the SGMII and the PHY management control seems to resolve this problem. This was observed with an AR8033 and QCA9558\n\n[OpenWrt-Devel,RFC] ar71xx: Reset QCA955x SGMII link on speed change - Patchwork\n\nand another:\n\nThe QCA955X is affected by a hardware bug which causes link-loss of the SGMII link between SoC and PHY. This happens on change of link-state or speed.\n\nIt is not really known what causes this bug. It definitely occurs when using a AR8033 Gigabit Ethernet PHY.\n\n[OpenWrt-Devel] [PATCH 1/2] ar71xx: fix QCA955X SGMII link loss\n\nAnd there are similar devices on the market with similar issues because they are using the same chipsets:\n\nar71xx: enable QCA955x SGMII fixup on Rambutan\n\nfixes intermittent loss of connectivity on 1Gbit port\n\ngit.openwrt.org Git - openwrt/openwrt.git/commit\n\nBasically, it’s a bug with the link negotation of the second port.  I can’t explain why it happens any better than any of the developers on these mailing lists can.  It’s intermittent and results in loss of the link state - so that’s why your visionWidget sometimes doesn’t connect.\n\nThe reccomended fix: Don’t use the second port on the OM5P Radios.  Use an ethernet switch and plug the switch into the primary port.  Plug everything else on your robot into the switch.\n\nYes.  See this paper: ZebraSwitch - Reliable Robot Ethernet that won't break your BOM\n\nYeah, I’d probably stick to using static IP addresses on the field and not rely on mDNS/Avahi/Zeroconf or DHCP.  Entirely up to you though.  Also, we continue to recommend this white paper on our “ZebraSwitch” methodology for how to make a reliable robot ethernet switch for an FRC robot.  It’s proven to be stable for many teams, including us.  You can also choose your own path to making a reliable ethernet switch but the important thing is, you might want to use a switch.",

I’ve been told more times than I can count during inspection that the switch is an added failure point and that we should only be using our radio if we can (normally only have the Rio and Limelight, so it’s easy enough for them to say we don’t need a switch cause we only have two devices).",

That’s awesome.  It probably means you’ll drive.\n\nSome teams don’t take power regulation seriously for things like ethernet switches and co-processors but others do.\n\nSadly, many FTAs are swamped at events and don’t have the time to dig into a robot and figure out exactly what is broken and they are looking for a tactical solution to get a team running.  This is a good tactical solution.\n\nUnfortunately, it’s not a good strategic solution.\n\nAnd per the blue box in R703, the switch is legal.

In our case:\n\nThe Rio is connected to the “First” (left) radio port\n\nThe switch is connected to the “Second” (right) radio port\n\nThe Limelight is connected to the switch.\n\nif the Rio doesn’t get a target from the Limelight, the shooter defaults to a Fender shot.\n\nSo in this architecture, a failure of the Radio Port 2 causes us to have to make Fender shots, but otherwise we can keep playing .    But if we were to reorganize the radio to feed through the switch, we introduce a couple of new failure modes (the switch, a second wire, and two connections) between the Rio and the Radio.   If any of those fail, we can’t play at all.    With that in mind, I’m tempted to take our chances with the switch on the 2nd radio port.",

On Saturday we powered up our robot during practice one time and the Limelight didn’t connect or show up in the dashboard.  Powering off the limelight at the MPM fuse and also restarting the dashboard at the same time fixed it (not sure which one it was).  It certainly sounds like this problem.  I think we had this in competition in 2020 with our Raspberry PI too, and we installed a switch, but never got to compete again.  Thanks for reminding us of ZebraSwitch.\n\nWe have two of the SW-005’s… we will try installing one of those if we get time before the next competition.\n\nIt would be nice if there was an update to the FTAs about this.",

Nothing at home, nothing at competition.\n\nThroughout build season I get lots of questions from within the team:\n\n“why can’t we just use the second port on the radio”\n\n“why do we need a switch”\n\n“why do you want to spend extra money on a switch and increase wiring”\n\n“why do you need the voltage step up/down converter?”\n\n“why do you want me to design a 3D printed case for it, we can just velcro it?”\n\nLong story short: You’ll probably come up with many excuses why not to do this, and as tho it might seem like a big effort: you’ll 1000% thank 900 for their efforts into making a robust solution that JUST WORKS.\n\nWe have a spare 3D printed box with switch and voltage regulator; we’re bringing it to Houston plus our practice robot set. If we end up playing play-offs I’ll highly recommend a team that’s not using a switch to take our spares. Our alliance partner 1884 had network radio issues in the semi finals this year and I’ve heard many other teams talking about/shouting through a match: “WE LOST OUR LIMELIGHT, WE’RE GOING TO PLAY DEFENSE”\n\nA simple and robust solution will save you lots of headache at competition. It’s just one thing less to worry about on your robot!\n\nimage (25) 1120×771 140 KB If you want to adopt our design here are our CAD files; 4481 ZebraSwitch CAD - Google Drive\n\nimage (25) 1120×771 140 KB\n\nimage (25) 1120×771 140 KB\n\nEDIT:\n\nWe run our radio, limelight, usb webcam through the limelight and for the practice field we connect our ethernet cable on the switch as well. It’s mounted on the side of our shooter tower for easy access and makes it easy to plug-in your ethernet for easy maintenance/testing.\n\nYou can see it down below our radio on the side of the robot.\n\nWhatsApp Image 2022-03-21 at 9.13.01 PM (2) 767×859 225 KB\n\nWhatsApp Image 2022-03-21 at 9.13.01 PM (2) 767×859 225 KB\n\nWhatsApp Image 2022-03-21 at 9.13.01 PM (2) 767×859 225 KB",
