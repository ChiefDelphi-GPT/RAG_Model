                    "cooked": "Hi CD , Our rookie team is trying to get our swerve drivebase up and running, and we need some help with planning our programming journey. Our hardware setup involves 4 donated WCP swerve X flipped corner mounts with 2 Falcon 500s per module, and we plan on purchasing the 4 CTRE CANcoders that go with them, as they seem the most widely used (the donating team kept theirs). We were wondering if we could replace them with the $30 ones at Thrifty Bot, but I have a feeling this is not a good idea. Has anyone managed to use the Thrifty bot encoders, or is sticking with the CTRE ones worth it? Since we’re a school-funded team, we can’t afford the $200 Pigoen IMU, so we plan on using our existing NavX 2 with our roboRio 2.0, meaning we will not have access to CTRE ’s swerve code generator.\n\nWhat would be the most beginner-friendly way to get our drivebase up and running with our current hardware setup? To start, I’m assuming Java is the way to go as it is documented extensively. Then we’ll set the CAN IDs of our hardware in tuner X and get our encoder offset values from there, along with knowing our gear ratios, chassis length. After this stage, should we use a swerve template on WPILib? Any recommendations on what challenges you might foresee us encountering, and how we should start programming? Also, is it best to have one programmer working on the code or multiple? We plan on sharing one Windows computer at school. Is this a common setup and something viable? Am I missing out on anything that I should know?  Are there any resources out there that people would recommend for the basics?\n\nThanks a ton, we wanted to open up this avenue for help requests along the way, and for any experienced teams to share their advice. We wanted to make sure that our order for the CANcoders is followed by a smooth programming transition, as they are pretty expensive: $270. We may just be overcomplicating a bit…\n\nEdit: What are the advantages and disadvantages between the TBT Encoder and CTRE Cancoder? (Both are absolute-magnetic encoders) So far, here is what we understand:\n\nCANcoder:\n\nWired through a CAN\n\nConfigured in Tuner X\n\nDesigned for WCP Swerves\n\nTBT Encoder:\n\nWired directly to Roborio\n\nMostly used with MK Modules from SDS",

WPILIB  version works, I used the AdvantageKit TalonFX example project, doesn’t really matter. I would say to start simple to begin with, don’t try and get fancy and add your own features until you have a base that you know works (based on a template is best). Doubt your team will make this mistake like ours, but since you are using cancoders, glue the magnets (or else your offset will keep changing as the magnet moves around - don’t ask me how long it took me to figure that out on our robot). Since you are using a NavX, one suggestion that worked for us is to use USB as backup power to avoid disconnects while playing and having to reset the gyro (which you should definitely make a button for if you don’t already have one). Number of programmers depends on y’alls skill level, I would still definitely recommend you guys looking over each other’s code even if you don’t all collaborate on it. Sharing one computer can be fine, just going to be a bit of a pain - using github would probably alleviate any potential annoyances there. As for basics, I would recommend just reading the WPIlib docs to understand how swerve works and the libraries/methods function.",

It is definitely much cheaper I’ll run this option through our mentor as well, so we can pick between the CANcoder and the Thriftybot Encoder. I’ll have to confirm if the case is compatible for mounting on our modules but we can probably 3D print a custom one if needed. We’re currently making the choice between the two, and one factor is definitely the price.\n\nJust out of curiosity, how’s the performance of the encoder? Is programming very similar regardless of which one you select? I’m aware that the CANcoder uses the Phoenix 6 library, and you can update it and whatnot in tuner X, but not so sure about the Thrifty Bot one.
