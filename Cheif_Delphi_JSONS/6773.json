                    "cooked": "Hey all, looking for opinions and ideas as to what other teams do for selecting autos, or maybe spark discussion on the merits of different solutions. I am writing in terms of selecting a PathPlanner auto by name below, but a lot of it should pertain to any setup with multiple autos to choose between.\n\nOnce we achieved journeyman status in making and running PathPlanner autos, our auto routine count ballooned (We wanted to be flexible, so we are talking like ~20). Amp side autos, source side autos, mid autos, starting from different points, doing note in different orders. We had a sensible naming scheme, but the best organization dashboard-side was an alphabetical list which was still very long.\n\nIdeas:\n\nUsing multiple SendableChoosers, or creating some kind of tree selector widget Pros: Easier to find/choose your desired auto accurately (but not necessarily quickly) Cons: Adds a lot of fragility/exposure to implementation errors, between multiple/custom senders and reassembling a PathPlanner auto name to pick. May take more time to choose (see problem 2).\n\nPros: Easier to find/choose your desired auto accurately (but not necessarily quickly)\n\nCons: Adds a lot of fragility/exposure to implementation errors, between multiple/custom senders and reassembling a PathPlanner auto name to pick. May take more time to choose (see problem 2).\n\nParing down the list of autos to only a few or a single one based on the match plan. Pros: Much easier to pick. Cons: Susceptible to human error in mishearing what auto to leave in, pulling autos back out of “cold storage” to deploy to the RIO is annoying/time consuming\n\nPros: Much easier to pick.\n\nCons: Susceptible to human error in mishearing what auto to leave in, pulling autos back out of “cold storage” to deploy to the RIO is annoying/time consuming\n\nDrastically reducing the number of autos we offer to run for our alliance Pros: Sidesteps the problem entirely Cons: Annoying to deal with, having to be firm/pushy, especially in cases where we don’t have evidence of ours being “good” yet.\n\nPros: Sidesteps the problem entirely\n\nCons: Annoying to deal with, having to be firm/pushy, especially in cases where we don’t have evidence of ours being “good” yet.\n\nOn at least one occasion, we ended up not running an auto because we were among the final bots to connect to the field in a practice match and the match was started before the drive team could choose from the drop-down.\n\nIdeas:\n\nTraining the drive team to hold thumbs-down until 100% ready Pros: Will probably work Cons: Would love to not have to rely on this if others have ideas\n\nPros: Will probably work\n\nCons: Would love to not have to rely on this if others have ideas\n\nSetting a default PathPlanner auto name to preload/run if nothing else is selected Pros: Will work Cons: Hardcoding vs a PathPlanner auto name, the desired default may be different for any given match, a lot like “paring down the list” above.\n\nPros: Will work\n\nCons: Hardcoding vs a PathPlanner auto name, the desired default may be different for any given match, a lot like “paring down the list” above.\n\nUsing a physical hardware element to choose the auto (We did this many years ago) Pros: Not beholden to the FMS Cons: Inflexible/prone to human error especially if we aren’t writing the names of autos on whatever the switch setup is. God help us if it was a set of dip switches to select from a library!\n\nPros: Not beholden to the FMS\n\nCons: Inflexible/prone to human error especially if we aren’t writing the names of autos on whatever the switch setup is. God help us if it was a set of dip switches to select from a library!\n\nWould love to hear ideas and opinions from anyone, or if you have other discussion topics somewhere along these lines.",

Happened for me during ISR DCMP .  I called over the Refs and told them my computer was just really slow (and bot connected really late) before the match started, and they told the main guy (don’t really know the positions) to not start the match. However, he did not hear the Refs and the match started . Thankfully, they paused it like half a second after starting and we were given time to set up.\n\nHowever, we were always consistently the last bot to connect, which really sucked bcs I usually had about less than a  minute to set everything up, like controllers, auto, dashboard (etc.), which was pretty stressful. If anyone has any ideas how to make this faster or integrate software somehow,  I am ready to listen.",

As our former technician and now operator (i.e. field-side programmer), I will have our driver/coach hold a thumbs down from before the rio/radio boots and connects (before they can start the match) until I step away from the laptop and give a thumbs up.\n\nSomewhat off-topic but here’s the mental checklist I used setting up the DS before a match:\n\nThumbs-down\n\nCheck that joysticks are registering on the correct ports and that all axes read zero with controls centered\n\nWait for robot to connect\n\nCheck that odometry looks like approximately where the robot actually is on the field (yes we ran AdvantageScope on the DS laptop during matches because we didn’t have real data logging)\n\nCheck that the robot has the correct alliance from FMS\n\nSet the auto**\n\nEnable debug output from the robot (disabled by default because we thought it was causing memory leaks; it wasn’t and this should go away but we never got around to it)\n\nClear the console and verify that no new error messages are appearing\n\nThumbs up and step behind the line\n\nThis was sometimes annoyingly slow but we never had any failures related to improper setup.\n\n**We’re using a SendableChooser with a submit button.  We had choosers do weird things in 2022 to the point that I wouldn’t be confident what was selected, so in addition to the auto chooser we have a “set auto” button and a “selected auto” text box.  Pressing set auto reads the chooser and sets the auto command, then gets the name of the auto command and writes it to the text box, giving confirmation that the correct auto is selected.",
