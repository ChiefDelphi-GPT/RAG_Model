But the details are important.\n\nHere are a few suggestions:\n\nUse the AM cross fitting to connect the pressure switch and the pressure relief valve to the compressor. While you can use a series of brass fittings, you want to keep the overhung mass that is supported by the compressor output fitting to a minimum. The output fitting on the compressor can fatigue over time and fail if there is too much weight hung on a long arm off of that fitting.\n\nUse the AM cross fitting to connect the pressure switch and the pressure relief valve to the compressor.

The air and the head of the compressor get quite hot and the plastic tubing does not deal well with this high temperature. The cross fitting and those two components seem to have just enough thermal mass to prevent things from getting too hot.\n\nConversely, do not hook up a press-in fitting and transition to the plastic tubing immediately.

Upstream of the tank, the air “pulses” coming out of the compressor will cause the needle to jump around a lot. downstream of the tank, those pulses are gone.\n\nDefinitely attach the high pressure gauge downstream of the tank.

Avoid errant bits of teflon tape or other debris getting into the components. That debris will eventually find its way to your valves or other critical components and cause them to leak during the critical finals match.\n\nKeep your system as clean as possible when building it.

I think we used black for high pressure (120 psi), red for low pressure (60 psi) , and white for vent last year. Use whatever colors match your teams color scheme as long as you know what they are. I’ve found it helps when troubleshooting problems with tubing and getting through inspection easier. It helps a lot to see the different color of tubing if you have to jam a bunch of air tanks in different places throughout the robot.",

It’s incredibly fast, wouldn’t be limited to 8 solenoids and would be able to connect to the RIO or hub/switch through a standard ethernet cable.\n\nIt seems to be what a lot of industry standard communication protocols are using lately, and it could/would be a good way to introduce kids to that type of programming as well.",

If memory serves, even the dumb (as in not “smart” with the internal solenoid connections) 8 point manifold was pretty costly. And of course, what we have now works very well.",

It is likely that schools will already have Grainger and/or McMaster Carr as approved vendors. It will be more difficult for teams to purchase parts if they have to convince the school to add ABC Co. to the approved vendor list.",

All the air blowing back out from the tanks cooled the tubing so we didn’t realize how hot it was.  We replaced with a different batch and it happened again at the same spot.  That’s when we investigated.  We had the tubing plugged into a fitting right next to the compressor.  After that, we started putting a few inches of hard fittings and components before the switch to tubing to act as a heat sink.",
