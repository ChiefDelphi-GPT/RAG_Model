                    "cooked": "Hello all, I am thinking through improvements to our team’s autonomous system, and I am unsure what tools / methods satisfy the requirements I am looking for.  Here’s the workflow that I would like:\n\nI find our alliance partners to talk strategy for a match.  I bring a tablet / laptop to the meeting.  On that device, I have a PathPlanner-like gui where I can keyframe our robot’s autonomous path and play it back.  I have preset auto paths, but I can edit and customize any part of the path in the moment as we discuss strategy.\n\nWe decide on auto routines.  I come back to the pit and load the auto onto the driver station laptop (which stays at the pit for use in testing).  Loading the auto is done through a thumb drive, USB cord, qr code, or whatever works best.\n\nAs we prepare for the match, I can continue to edit the auto however I want, through the same gui, on the driver station laptop.  I can also edit setpoints, motor speeds, etc.  When I am done, I lock the auto, signifying that it is completed (I can unlock it and change it if need be—this is just to let the whole drive team know that the auto is ready to go).\n\nWhen the robot is positioned on the field before the match and it connects to our driver station, the robot loads in the auto that is saved on the computer.  We don’t need to redeploy, and we can edit our auto in queue, during robot placement, or even during team introductions.\n\nAs someone who has only ever used Shuffleboard for auto config, I have no idea how to implement this system.  PathPlanner seems like the closest existing tool, but they specifically say not to use their hot reloading feature during competitions.  What do more advanced teams do?  Does anyone have recommendations of how to implement the system I described? Thanks for any thoughts you have.",

You could add in commands wherever is appropriate.\n\nHowever, there are many liabilities with this system. What if you mess up a path or forget to add segments? What if you run out of time?

Don’t try to reinvent the wheel, that’s literally the point of coding libraries and developed applications.\n\nIn order to be flexible, you have to know you can do flexible correctly every time no matter what. You will want to design a very robust auto system that you don’t ever have to test. This is a difficult problem to solve because it is often more advantageous to create 2-3 really quick autos that you spend lots of time tuning than an unlimited supply of slower ones.\n\nWe are starting to experiment with on-the-fly auto making, and it starts with creating a discipline approach that will guarantee that we can do something like that in the heat of the moment. It’s a lot of work, but can be done. It’s your job to prove to yourself that it can be done every single time no matter what.",

Instead of having a single path for a full autonomous, split the path into separate segments and tie them together at runtime based on the selections you make on your dashboard. Bonus points for using conditionals for picking a different segment after some decision point (such as using vision to check if your first choice game piece is available) instead of blindly following the path.\n\nSomething like this (hopefully the pseudocode gets the point across). Assumes all the trajectory segments are pregenerated and you’ve written some logic to determine which segment to follow based on known starting and target positions.\n\nThe implementation will be a lot simpler in 2027 when we can use coroutines on the new MRC, but it’s still fundamentally about breaking up a large problem into many smaller parts that can be dynamically combined. When you think about it, that’s basically the essence of software engineering.",

I could make many different paths and sequences in PathPlanner, but from what you are suggesting it seems like the actual building of your auto would be done through dropdowns in Shuffleboard.  Is there a more visual way to do it?  Ideally, I would like to be able to play through the combined sequence of autos, and see them laid out on a field map.",

How would I handle the network tables interaction if I were to build my own app?  Thanks for your recommendation",

Why don’t we have those now and I’m assuming the MRC will have Kotlin support?\n\nBecause OpenJDK does not implement stack frame saving (which is needed for coroutines to work) on arm32 (the roboRIO’s CPU architecture). The MRC will have a 64-bit CPU, which OpenJDK does support.\n\nI don’t see any reason why the MRC wouldn’t be able to support Kotlin - if it can run Java, it should be able to run any JVM -based language.",
