                    "cooked": "I picked up a couple of Thrifty Novas to test out over the summer.  My hope was to use them with a lower cost mini swerve bot (Nerd Swerve).  I got ahead of myself and tried them with YAGSL and struggled, but it’s my first attempt at a lot of this.  There was very erratic motor behavior.  So I got down to basics and am now only figuring out how to get the PIDs alone to work.\n\nUsing a simple program, I’ve just been trying to get one Nova running a Neo at a specified velocity.  With just P, its all jerky but does get up to maintain a speed (less than setpoint).  If I add some FF, I can get it to start more reliably and get closer to setpoint.  I added some I in and it doesn’t seem to accumulate, or it gets erratic.  At this point, I’m just trying to spin the Neo under no load to maintain a speed.\n\nReally, I’m Just wondering if people have used the closed loop PIDs on the Nova. Can’t find much info on them yet.  Only a couple teams said they work and there were few details.\n\n@Sam_Dare FYI there are a few errors in the example code on the website.\n\nFor reference, here is the controller setup. In the rest of the code, I’m just running at velocity “400” (ticks/second?) with a button, or running it up and down with a joystick without a PID .  Max Output and Current intentionally set low so I don’t destroy something.",

We will get you taken care of.\n\nI know quite a few teams that used the position PID last year on the robot, and I know we have an internal verification of the velocity loop, but I’ll get you plugged in with our guys to see what’s going on. YAGSL support is very much ongoing, and we are working on our own swerve generator we may be able to give you access to for some additional testing. One of the current known pain points is the units not being in native rotations, which makes the PID values more confusing than we would like, so we are working to solve that.",

The stable proportional gain in a SparkMAX for velocity of an unloaded NEO is miniscule and will leave huge setpoint offset.  Adding integral just makes the instability caused by the effective delay from all the filtering worse.\n\nAdding inertial load of a heavy flywheel for a shooter or the mass of a robot for swerve velocity control will slow down the velocity loop dynamics such that the controller filtering no longer dominates the dynamics and velocity control with a NEO starts to become feasible.  However, you should still be looking to get the vast majority of your velocity control from feedforward so the feedback can be gentle and not throw the loop into instability trying to closely track a setpoint.",

I put together a full Nova Swerve bot this summer to work with. I think the existing code is not in a working state and I do have a PR into YAGSL for some improvements. Figuring out the internal PID -controller behavior and distance to encoder ticks conversion logic has been the sticking point and I think the current code made an incorrect assumption about whether the factor was in output-units/rotation or rotations/output-unit (the former is correct, not latter). I also found out from Thrifty that there’s an undocumented setVelocity function that takes both the velocity setpoint and the feedforward as a voltage and I finally tried it out last night. If you’d like, you can check out my updates here . Specifically, this file , though the new API call isn’t there yet.\n\nOther issues I’m working on are, 1. No velocity output from the Novas, 2. tuning the PID (well just P) for drive. I’m using kP=0.0005 for angle and kP=0.0003 for drive, which seems OK, but I think I’m seeing the unloaded drive motor problem described above, though there may still be other issues in addition.\n\nLet me know if you’d like to collaborate on this. Thanks!",

This runs fine on the unloaded Neo with only feed forward.\n\nThe right stick will control the position (moving the stick from up to down should rotate it 360 degrees).  Pressing B make is spin at a fixed percentage as a sanity check.\n\nWith the steer P set very low, I can feel it moving the motor in the right direction to hit the setpoint.  When it hits the setpoint, it oscillates pretty violently.  If I move the joystick, the setpoint does change as well.  This is the same behavior I saw when running it via Thrifty Config.\n\nI suspect the internal distance to setpoint is (or isn’t) wrapping around properly, causing the significant oscillation. (yellow on the graph).  This behavior happens with or without “Absolute Encoder Wrapping” on or off.\n\nScreenshot 2025-08-07 192902 2783×1120 228 KB\n\nScreenshot 2025-08-07 192902 2783×1120 228 KB\n\nScreenshot 2025-08-07 192902 2783×1120 228 KB",
