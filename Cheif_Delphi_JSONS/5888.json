                    "cooked": "Hello,\n\nMy team has been using YAGSL to control our swerve. For a while, it was working quite well. Recently, however, the behavior has been pretty inconsistent. When driving straight forward, for example, at least one, if not more, module is several degrees off of its setpoint. I’m fairly sure that it’s not an encoder issue because I’m using Elastic’s swerve widget to visualize the encoder readings, and they reflect the issue as well. Additionally, a recent test showed driving (non-field-relative) straight forward resulted in all modules pointing several degrees off on the same direction, even though the commanded states were clearly straight forward. Again, Elastic’s swerve widget clearly showed this issue as well. I wouldn’t think that it’s an electrical issue because all the motors are still running , just in the wrong ways.\n\nI also found it interesting that, when a module is pointing the wrong way, the drive speed is slower than a module that is pointing the right way.\n\nFinally, not sure if this is relevant or not, but I have run setHeadingCorrection(true) , yet the robot does not try any sort of heading correction whatsoever if it is manually rotated by hand.\n\nI’m very sorry if I’ve missed any critical data, I’m quite confused by this whole thing. Thanks for any help!",

Up on blocks? On carpet? At full power or only a small percentage?\n\nIf just commanding module position (not velocity) is the pointing more consistent? Does it only drift/not hit targets while commanding a velocity?\n\nMy initial thought, which I think explains some of the issues, is the PID is not hitting its setpoints (“under tuned” for the system). Could you verify the moudles think they are where they should be (i.e. they are commanded to a few degrees off) or of they are trying and failing to get to a setpoint (i.e. never reaching where they want to be) ?",

                    "cooked": "Alright, so after more testing, I’ve determined a consistent issue: When I start the robot, (AKA all encoders calibrated) the wheel goes to the setpoint correctly. (45 deg in this case since I’m using lockPose() ) If I turn the wheel 180 degrees and attempt the same setpoint, the wheel is a few degrees off. Another 180 degrees and the error grows by a few degrees. This trend continues the more I turn the wheel. This tells me it’s most likely a conversion factor issue, but I’m still confused about something: Doesn’t YAGSL automatically sync the motor’s encoders with the absolute encoders when the motors aren’t running or something like that? I also tried running syncronizeModuleEncoders() in the periodic() method, but it didn’t seem to change anything. I understand that ultimately the solution should be to change the conversionFactor and/or gearRatio fields in the YAGSL configuration, but I’m still confused as to why this is happening.",
