We often move our equipment in the back of our school bus or in the back of vans. So we didn’t want to build out a super pit or anything like that.\n\nWe wanted them to be durable. We have had numerous issues with various plastic storage cases over the years, ranging from latches breaking to the entire lid cracking.\n\nEasy to label and keep organized. We wanted to label each container and have maps indicating the location of each compartment, etc.\n\nBe customizable for each application. There are many great containers and storage cases, but you can’t always customize their compartments to suit your needs. We decided that using something like Gridfinity, which allows for all the customization we needed, was the best option.\n\nWe want to be able to take each storage box to another team’s pit, or to a table, or put it on our cart, etc. This eliminated something like Milwaukee packout drawers and the like.\n\nWe wanted each case to store a large number of items. We didn’t want to have to have overflow storage for all our fasteners and parts that we store in these cases.\n\nDurham 123-95: Steel Deep Compartment Boxes (we buy them empty) There are several places to buy these; MSC was the cheapest we found.\n\nThere are several places to buy these; MSC was the cheapest we found.\n\nValue Collection BDNA-80320-1B: 4 Drawer Small Parts Slide Rack\n\nModified Gridfinity grids and bins.\n\nimage 777×594 32.1 KB image 905×667 40.4 KB image 722×915 74.6 KB\n\nimage 777×594 32.1 KB\n\nimage 777×594 32.1 KB\n\nimage 905×667 40.4 KB\n\nimage 905×667 40.4 KB\n\nimage 722×915 74.6 KB\n\nimage 722×915 74.6 KB\n\nWe modified the drawer units in several ways.

I like the idea of using metal bins instead of the plastic ones, we have had trouble with those in the past. At the same time, those also look a lot bigger than most of the plastic organizers in that style. How heavy are these? I know the chain box we have with the large version of the plastic organizers is very heavy. How much are these when fully loaded? Can an average freshman carry one?",

For example, 4926 doesn’t stock 2 or 3” length 10-32s because they seem to have limited usefulness when leaving 1/4” of thread for a typical Nyloc.\n\nHere’s what’s in our 10-32 SHCS Box (and why) 0.50 - used on many cots systems 0.75 - Bolting two 1/4” things together 1.00 - Bolting a 1/2” thing to a 1/4” thing. 1.25 - Bolting two 1/2” things together 1.50  - Bolting 1/8” or 1/4” plate to the to a 1”x1” or 2” side of a 2”x1” 1.75  - Bolting a 1” thing to a 1/2” thing 2.25 - Bolting a 1”x1” to another 1”x1” 2.50 - Bolting 1/4” plate to the 1” side of a 2”x1” 2.75 - Bolting a 2” thing to a 1/2” thing 3.50 - Bolt a 2” to a 1” thing (Readily available from McMaster - 3.25 is not) 4.50 - Bolt 2” things together (Readily available from McMaster - 4.25 is not)\n\nA 2” bolt could be useful to bolting a 1.5” thing to a 1/4” plate, but we just don’t seem to use 1.5” things very often. So we don’t stock 2” length bolts.\n\nI could probably be convinced to stock 1/4” length bolts for some Cots replacement applications.",
