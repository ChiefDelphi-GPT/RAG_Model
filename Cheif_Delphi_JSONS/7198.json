The wrist, connected to a REV Through Bore Encoder, would slam down completely randomly. At first, we thought it was caused by heavy collisions, as the jump occurred most frequently after hitting something at a high speed. However, it’s also happened multiple times after we lightly bumped into a note during an auto, so it seems to be more random than we initially thought. We looked at the logs and found that the issue was not due to the encoder resetting, but rather a jump in the reading.\n\nimage 1469×924 45.6 KB\n\nimage 1469×924 45.6 KB\n\nimage 1469×924 45.6 KB\n\nThe reading would be stable, but then randomly jump about 1.5 radians. It has consistently jumped by this much, although it has occurred almost exclusively at competition. We have implemented a failsafe, but are curious as to why this happens and how it can be fixed.",

In the logs we clearly see during a loop of periodic BOTH encoders simultaneously report zero. That has to be a RIO issue in that case.\n\nWe only use the encoders on robot start up once. Using the angle they report we then set the encoder position of the SparkMax controlling the arm to the position it would be at that that angle.\n\nThen we control the angle of the arm just by seeking an encoder position on the SparkMax.\n\nWe then monitor the SparkMax for failures and shut down the arm if it fails.
