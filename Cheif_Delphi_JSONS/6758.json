                    "cooked": "I’m wondering if there’s anyone here on chief delphi who has had success with using the simulation features of photonvision.\n\nI believe I set up everything properly, and for the most part everything seems to be working. I can see the tags in the simulated camera viewport as I drive around, I can see the tag poses in the debug field, and the photonlib API is receiving pose estimates as normal.\n\nThe only problem is, that the pose estimates coming from photonvision are incorrect a good majority of the time.\n\nBelow are a few screenshots which show what I mean. The pink box represents the “ground truth” pose of the robot while the green box is the pose estimate from photonlib via the simulation. The small green rectangles represent where detected apriltags should be while the small orange rectangles near them represent the result of transforming the estimated robot position by the camera transform and the apriltag transform from photonlib.\n\nsimulated camera stream 1494×752 62.1 KB\n\nsimulated camera stream 1494×752 62.1 KB\n\nsimulated camera stream 1494×752 62.1 KB\n\nIn this first example you can see that photonvision, while seeing the 2 speaker tags, is estimating a pose off by a good 15cm or so, with the reprojected apriltag poses appearing behind the real ones also by several centimeters.\n\nHere’s the robot on another part of the field looking at the blue source apriltags and seeing the same type of thing. The pose estimate has a translation and rotation error from simulated ground-truth.\n\nFurthermore, it seems that the pose error on the apriltags is not the same as that of the robot poses. That is, they could not be corrected by the same offset.\n\nIn certain parts of the field, estimation is perfect. In general, when looking at adjacent tags on the stage which are at different angles, the pose estimate is almost perfect as shown here. Though if you look at the reprojected apriltags, they seem to still be behind the real apriltags by a little bit.\n\nIf you would like to look at the code or attempt to build and run our simulation yourself, you can access it on this branch here: Hopper/src/main/cpp/subsystems/Vision.cpp at vision-sim · FRC-3637-Daleks/Hopper · GitHub Fair warning though, it’s in C++.\n\nAt the moment, I’m not sure if its an issue with how I’ve set up the simulation, an underlying issue in photonlib or its simulation, or if this is somehow identifying an actual bug in our actual pose estimation. It’s hard to imagine that it could be the latter though, as I’m publishing the pose directly from photonlib, and I’m using the FRC provided field layouts.\n\nWhat’s making it tricky for me to diagnose is those few apriltag combinations where the estimate is perfect.\n\nI don’t expect anyone to try and run this themselves, nor do I expect anyone else has run into this exact problem (but I can hope), but I’m desperate for ideas on what to investigate to diagnose this problem further.",

I haven’t had the time to diagnose though because I am mentoring my team, and the code was written just before build season started.\n\nFrom the picture it seems like the detection squares are not centered on the tag.",

The main issue with the real robot right now is that Glass still has the incorrect field image so it’s hard to compare the result to the field markings on our practice field.\n\nAnd at our first competition last weekend I’m now suspicious of the field construction and am not confident either way if we saw vision issues and if they were due to our code or the field.\n\nI did notice that the markings don’t line up with the apriltags in the camera image, but I saw this issue even in the 3rd case where the position estimate is good.\n\nThough I suppose the estimated position of the tags is still off in that case, which might mean that having the skewed view like that just results in the proper optimal pose with error on the tags cancelling our.\n\nIf you think it possible that photonvision’s simulation is at error, then I may dive into the code there and try to find a bug.\n\nI was hoping to use the sim to refine our fusing algorithm with odometry.

Not sure if this is simulation only or a quirk of photonvision in general.\n\nAll I know is, if I set pitch to 0, then my single tag estimations are perfect, and my multitag poses with tags at multiple angles are pretty decent. Multitag poses using parallel tags are still pretty faulty though, unsure if this is a sim or photonlib issue.\n\nFor now I’m going to call it good enough. I will investigate camera pitch issues after our competition.",
