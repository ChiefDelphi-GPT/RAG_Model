It is working in our current lighting environment at school, but I am worried that the Pipeline will work with the lighting at the tournament. Please see the attached image and if you are able to, provide feedback on what we can do to make it more adaptable to other lighting environments. Also, what tips do any of you have for tuning the arguments for “Filter Contours” step (like perimeter, height, etc.)?

This will likely produce a more “yellow” tinted light than you’ll find in most arenas or gymnasiums. One thing you can experiment with is bringing in different kinds of lights and seeing how your pipeline reacts when the cone is under different kinds of lighting. If possible, test it outside in direct sunlight.\n\nA few tips on your pipeline…\n\nThe first block is downscaling your image to 25% of its original size. If you are only using the camera for blob detection, you may get better performance by reducing the camera resolution and avoiding the rescale operation.\n\nYou might want to Blur the image before you do contour detection. This can make the blob a bit more uniform by smoothing out minor color variations or imperfections.\n\nAfter your HSV Threshold step, you may want to consider using the Erode block to remove small details that could confuse the contour generator. (There is also a pair of complementary blocks whose names I forget offhand that can do this.)\n\nAll of this depends on how much noise you are getting in your detection output. Less is more, so if you don’t need a processing step in order to get good results, take it out.\n\nAlso, GRIP makes it really easy to run test images through yoru pipeline while tuning, so collect as many images of your target as you can (you can find a lot here on CD) and you’ll have more confidence in your algorithm.",

Often image processing packages put the two together as open or close .\n\nI’ve found that the lighting conditions in my team’s work area is worse or harder to adjust to than the real arenas. We’ve tended to plan for much worse than actually happens. Last season the high hub did gave problems with bright lights and windows. We had to have a white point cutoff. I doubt that is needed this year. Probably never hurts to add a black point cutoff but we’ve never seen it help.\n\nFor the OP, in Windows OP can get a good screen print without having to take a photo. WindowKey+Shift+S opens the app and you can select what to capture. I typically draw the rectangle that I want and the window or full screen work well, too. OP can paste it in the post.\n\nNot sure if OP will be using generated code on the roboRIO or co-processor or the DriverStaion. Or is this how GRIP will be run at competitions in which case beware that the several outputs sent over NetworkTables are not a transaction and you can get the “X” of one frame combined with the “Y” of the next frame which at high movement speeds can be problematic. There are ways around that depending on where the processing is being done and a GRIP developer helped me here on CD for alternatives.",
