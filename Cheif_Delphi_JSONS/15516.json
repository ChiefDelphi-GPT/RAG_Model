In an attempt to combat this, we are attempting to implement current limiting. Our current motor layout (for the systems with the most current draw) is the following.\n\n2x Neos geared 1:1 on the flywheel on 40a breakers\n\n6x Neos (3 each side) geared 11.03:1 on the drive on 5in wheels on 40a breakers. (18.5ft/s high gear)\n\nWhat would the process be for finding the optimal current limits for these two systems? Is there a general rule of thumb for calculating this?",

Just using %Vin will cause the actual motor output to be lower as the battery voltage drops, which is not what you want.\n\nYou can also use the DS Log Viewer to view current consumption for each PDP / PDH channel, which will give you a sense of the average/peak currents that are currently occurring, as well as the battery voltage droop you’re seeing.\n\nIn general, setting this kind of current limiting may be best to be done via testing rather than any kind of analytical method.",

                    "cooked": "Last time I got seriously into this, I believe we settled on a max temporary draw of 180 amps across all the sub systems.  Ctre has a feature that will allow you to set a high initial current for a time then jump down.  We would change our max allowed current to the subsystem based on what was running.  If only the drivetrain was commanded it got the full 180.  If other systems were coming online we would limit the drive so we could distribute the current elsewhere.  The first key though is doing some testing so you know what your systems are going to be drawing when they are spooling up and running.  Just be very careful doing too many set current commands. I remember they used to carry quite a bit of overhead on the can network (much like setting pid constants too often).  At the same time, make sure you are setting your voltage compensation down to 12 or 11.5.  This will help your systems remain linear or at least follow your model as voltage sags from high current draw.",

Next up is making triple sure that the wires are right: white to white, red to red, black to black.  If you didn’t buy white andersons, use white tape/fingernail polish to code it. Finally, tug on the wire for absolutely every single anderson, and then look inside the shell to verify that the contact is fully in. We, um, -might- have had just about every one of these problems…  Made worse by long extensions to all the cables without having white wire…",
