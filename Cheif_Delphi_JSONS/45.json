                    "cooked": "Hi, I'm Astrin, the vision lead for my team, 1038. This is our first year incorporating vision as the primary component of our robot. Currently, we utilize photon vision alongside two Arducams—one black-and-white and one colored—alongside an Orange Pi 5 Pro. I have several questions regarding camera options and vision detection systems. I'm curious about alternative camera brands or models suitable for robotics projects like ours. Additionally, I want to understand why certain teams prefer specific software or systems over others. Do you have any recommendations for resources or tools we might explore in the future? Lastly, I'm concerned that fewer team members seem eager to delve deeper into object detection and vision-related topics. As a senior and a leader, this concern is weighing on me. I would greatly appreciate any guidance on how to inspire greater interest in these areas among my team members.",

While I can't speak much about the overall vision, my focus was on the auto division, but I wanted to share my thoughts on succession and legacy.\n\nI forwarded this to our vision specialist, though.\n\nWhen I graduated, there wasn't someone new who could step in and take over. I'm not saying this to boast; there simply weren't many interested freshmen. During my senior year, I wasn't able to take someone under my wing either. We attempted to implement a mentorship program, but it didn't work out.\n\nHowever, I'd argue that the gap left by the other co-captain was even larger. He was the team's machining lead and the <strong>only</strong> machinist. He dedicated a lot of time to machining, CAD, and worked extensively outside of meetings on the robot. He tried hard to get others interested in the CNC mill, but no one showed much interest. It's still surprising to me because someone just needed to absorb the knowledge while he was still around and able to teach in person. People didn't realize how important the knowledge they were about to lose was. This year, a relatively inexperienced member took on the machining lead role, and I remember how often the new lead and our mentor were reaching out to him for guidance on various tasks.\n\nI'm not sure what we could have done differently to encourage more interest. Some students are eager to join FIRST and others aren't. The latter isn't inherently bad—it's just a matter of differing priorities. People often don't grasp the value of what they're losing until it's gone. One key lesson I've learned is that you can't force someone to care more than they do. You can't push them to be more passionate or interested. All you can do is try to inspire them to understand the significance of what they're leaving behind, but ultimately, they'll have to make that choice themselves. They might come back to it in the future, maybe after a break from robotics.\n\nMaybe scheduling some discussions or meetups over the summer could help. I suggest waiting a bit longer into the summer to let things calm down—burnout was definitely a factor for us. Now, they might not feel like doing anything right now, but they could be open to it later. If no one ends up wanting to take on vision duties, that's okay too.\n\nThe assistant has already cleaned up the text, but perhaps the user would like additional refinements?

                    "cooked": "My perception is that there are two main camps in FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) vision: PhotonVision and Limelight. There is almost certainly another group of hardy souls who roll their own using OpenCV or neural network object detection models, such as YOLO or RetinaNet.\n\nFor PhotonVision, nearly any USB camera is a potential option. While there is a list of tested camera/coprocessor combinations available, this is merely a sample of possible cameras.\n\nTeams may choose PhotonVision or Limelight due to factors like cost—PhotonVision systems tend to be more affordable—and perceptions regarding support, software reliability, and features. Some teams prefer a vendor that offers clear support pathways and managed software development over open-source solutions. Others are comfortable with open-source options, potentially benefiting from faster access to new features or the ability to customize code. Additionally, some teams favor a tightly integrated hardware-software ecosystem, while others appreciate a flexible system that allows them to use existing tools or select preferred components.\n\nRegarding student interest in robot vision, it’s essential to engage those passionate about building high-performing robots. Without enthusiasm for competitive performance, addressing challenges becomes far more difficult. FIRST’s game design accommodates low-resource robots, but playing these games manually without vision assistance is frustrating. This frustration grows when encountering competitors who utilize advanced vision systems, significantly enhancing their autonomous routines.\n\nTo illustrate the importance of vision, students should experience gameplay both with and without vision active. If a robot cannot function without vision, the code should be modified accordingly. The stark contrast in performance should underscore the necessity of having team members skilled in vision implementation.",
