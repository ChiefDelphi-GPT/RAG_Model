Currently, we use photon vision alongside two Arducams—one black-and-white and one color-coded—alongside an Orange Pi 5 Pro. I have several questions regarding alternative camera options, the preferred vision detection software or systems used by other teams, and any emerging technologies worth exploring for future years. Additionally, I am concerned that fewer team members are eager to delve deeper into vision and object detection. As a senior and leader, this concerns me, and I would appreciate any advice on fostering greater interest in these areas among my team members.",

                    "cooked": "Hello,  \nI was a co-captain of team 4572 last year and am now finishing my first year of college. I led or oversaw the code and electrical departments on the team. While I can't speak much about the overall vision, my specialty was in auto mechanics, but I wanted to share my thoughts on succession. I’ve already forwarded this to our vision specialist.  \n\nI graduated without finding someone new who could genuinely step into my role. I’m not saying this for ego reasons—it’s simply that there weren’t many interested freshmen. During my senior year, I hadn’t been able to take someone under my wing either. We tried implementing a mentorship program, but it didn’t work out.  \n\nHowever, I’d argue that the gap left by the other co-captain was even larger. He was the team’s machining lead and the sole machinist. He dedicated himself immensely to the team—juggling machining tasks, CAD work, and spending countless hours outside of meetings on the robot project. He tried hard to get other students interested in the CNC mill, but nobody was really paying attention. It’s still surprising to me because someone just needed to bite the bullet and learn while he was still around to teach in person. People didn’t grasp the importance of the knowledge they were about to lose.  \n\nThis year, an inexperienced member took on the machining lead position, and I recall how often both he and our mentor would reach out to him for guidance on various tasks. I don’t know what we could have done differently to spark more interest. Some students seem willing to do whatever it takes to join FIRST, while others just don’t care enough. The latter isn’t inherently bad—they just prioritize things differently. People often don’t realize what they’re losing until it’s gone. One of the biggest lessons I’ve learned is that you can’t force someone to care more than they do. You can’t make them more interested or eager to learn. You can encourage and push them to see the value of what’s being passed on, but ultimately, they’ll have to take the initiative on their own. They’ll likely come back to ask questions next season or maybe even express interest later. Perhaps scheduling some calls or meetups over the summer could help—maybe a bit later in the summer to give everyone a chance to recover from burnout, if that’s an issue for your team. Some might not feel motivated right now, but they might be open to it later. If no one ends up wanting to take on vision tasks, that’s okay too.",

                    "cooked": "My perception is that there are two main camps in FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) vision, PhotonVision and Limelight. There is almost certainly another group of hardy souls that are rolling their own with OpenCV or neural network object detection models (e.g., YOLO, RetinaNet).\n\nFor PhotonVision, almost any USB camera is a potential option. There is a list of camera/coprocessor combinations that have been tested with PhotonVision, but this is only a sampling of possible cameras.\n\nKey reasons why teams might choose PhotonVision or Limelight include cost (PhotonVision systems will be less) and perceptions about support, software reliability, and software features. Some teams prefer a hardware/software vendor where there is some clear pathway to support and software development and release is vendor-managed rather than open-source. Other teams are fine with open-source and may see it as a way to get new features faster or tweak the code themselves if they would like. Some teams prefer a tight coupling of hardware and software, while others prefer a flexible ecosystem that lets them use what they have or what they would like.\n\nAs for getting students interested in robot vision, I'd try to find the ones that are interested in making a high-performance robot. If you don't have anyone that cares about the robot performing well and competing effectively, you have bigger problems. FIRST designs games to be playable in some sense by very low-resource robots, but playing them with all driving and operation done \"manually\" with no vision help is frustrating. The demoralization increases when there are many teams you play with that are giving their drivers all sorts of vision help and have supercharged their autonomous routines with vision.\n\nTo the extent that you have a robot that is currently being aided by vision, let students drive and play the game with vision on, and then make them play with vision turned off. If your robot won't run without vision, change the code to make that possible. The difference in gameplay effectiveness should be enough to convince anyone that the team must have some members capable of implementing vision.",
