After researching this topic this is my current understanding of the the available pathfollowing options:\n\nRAMSETE is an abbreviation for “Robotica Articolata e Mobile per i SErvizi e le TEcnologie”, a book that contained an article entitled, “Control of Wheeled Mobile Robots: An Experimental Overview” that described an algorithm that is now referred to as “the RAMSETE Algorithm,” and, DEPENDING ON THE IMPLEMENTATION, it CAN be (but doesn’t have to be) compatible with holonomic drives.  It can handle acceleration and velocity constraints.\n\nRAMSETE is an abbreviation for “Robotica Articolata e Mobile per i SErvizi e le TEcnologie”, a book that contained an article entitled, “Control of Wheeled Mobile Robots: An Experimental Overview” that described an algorithm that is now referred to as “the RAMSETE Algorithm,” and, DEPENDING ON THE IMPLEMENTATION, it CAN be (but doesn’t have to be) compatible with holonomic drives.  It can handle acceleration and velocity constraints.\n\nPure Pursuit is a separate algorithm that has nothing to do with RAMSETE and is not capable of taking advantage of holonomic drives.  It does not handle acceleration or velocity constraints and it can only attempt to match the actual path of the robot to some future point in the trajectory via steering.  The algorithm handles sharp turns poorly.\n\nPure Pursuit is a separate algorithm that has nothing to do with RAMSETE and is not capable of taking advantage of holonomic drives.  It does not handle acceleration or velocity constraints and it can only attempt to match the actual path of the robot to some future point in the trajectory via steering.  The algorithm handles sharp turns poorly.\n\nBoth of these algorithms appear to be what I am calling “path/trajectory followers”.   Neither algorithm has anything to do with generating paths/trajectories (paths do not have velocity/acceleration constraints, while trajectories do), and as far as I can tell both algorithms could theoretically (and sometimes do) operate on the same path/trajectory objects.\n\nBoth of these algorithms appear to be what I am calling “path/trajectory followers”.

A holonomic algorithm if offered, however it is PID based (thus, linear rather than nonlinear and presumably inferior to RAMSETE) and I did not research it much.

(Effectively, they have identical capabilities.)\n\nRoad Runner offers a similar multiple-path to single-trajectory system, where each segment is made up of either a spline or a straight-line segment.

(This appears to be a minor difference: FTC Lib/WPI Lib could execute a trajectory, then turn separately, then execute another trajectory.)\n\nRoad Runner offers the ability to reverse a trajectory.  I could not tell if WPI/FTC lib offers the same ability or if this ability can even reasonably be implemented.  (Perhaps by including a separate path that is the reverse of the first, then swapping the paths while retaining the current pose information?)\n\nRoad Runner offers the ability to reverse a trajectory.

It’s unclear exactly how its constraint system works to me, but I believe constraints are added as steps in a trajectory, rather than regions in space as is done in FTC/WPI Lib.\n\nRoad Runner also has a constraint system, but it works differently.

Thus, controlling the lateral error of a path requires some cleverness.\n\nA holonomic drive does not suffer this problem, and so can run a simpler algorithm with success.",
