Since 2018, our team has been working on our own vision solutions. During this time, we’ve realized a lack of documentation and support for custom vision systems in FIRST . Our mission is to provide the community with a wiki aimed at improving vision capabilities around the globe, as well as teaching how they work. The Green Alliance will be open to any contributors, which we hope will spread more knowledge of vision systems. The more ideas, technical knowledge, and systems that are contributed to The Green Alliance, the more our community can learn, grow, and innovate.\n\nFIRST is about teaching and inspiring people—students and mentors—about a variety of topics. One area that is most neglected is vision. We hope that teams will explore new opportunities that further their understanding of vision as a whole, allowing teams to have full control over their vision for their specific use cases and circumstances. By teaching and inspiring rookies and veterans alike to pursue custom vision solutions, our wish is that we can foster an environment of growth and learning, encouraging students to explore fields they may not have experienced otherwise.\n\nWhile The Green Alliance is certainly still fresh, it still covers a range of topics. As of release, The Green Alliance contains:\n\nCamera basics, properties, and more\n\nOpenCV and color detection\n\nAprilTag detection\n\nSome core aspects of trigonometry and linear algebra\n\nImplementation of driver cameras\n\nWhile we hope other teams will find their own topics to write about, our team currently plans on the following:\n\nTons of examples, GIFs, and images\n\nWe plan to go more in-depth into AprilTags and how they work (for FIRST ).\n\nOur own localization implementation\n\nChArUco calibration\n\nPlenty more visible on our roadmap\n\nThough we have plenty more to contribute, our knowledge and time are not infinite. That is why we need your help, and how we plan to keep The Green Alliance full of up-to-date knowledge for years to come. If your team has experience with any sort of custom vision, including, but not limited to, localization, object detection, driver cameras, or even things like how to optimally create and place camera mounts, please consider contributing!\n\nMore information on contributing can be found here .\n\nLocalization is hard .\n\nAlthough we have our own localization solution, there are a few reasons there is currently no article referencing localization.\n\nOur localization is not currently in a place where we can recommend it to other teams, but we are working to improve the quality and robustness of the system. We want to have reliable and accurate information, and we still have digging to do.\n\nWhile we may understand our localization, explaining it is a different story. We want to make sure our articles are as clear and concise as possible. As much as we are eager to share our ideas, we need some time to refine our personal approach into a broader solution for other teams to follow. While we do not require this level of explanation and generalization for everything on the site, localization is a topic that needs a lot of work to be taught and understood.\n\nIn summary, there is no localization yet . However, as a community, we can tackle this challenge and provide a reliable source for this information. If your team has experience with their own localization and cares to explain it, please consider contributing.\n\nThe Green Alliance has been in the works on and off since 2022. We are incredibly proud and excited to bring this resource to the community and can’t wait to see what it becomes in the future.\n\n- φ",
