                    "cooked": "Hello, We have an Evolution RAGE4 chop saw that we use to cut aluminum tubing. It was here when I arrived two years ago and I’ve grown to dislike it. Its incredibly loud.  The cuts are inaccurate at best and the cut face is ragged.  I’ve learned that we need to change blade (using the Evolution Power Tools RAGEBLADE 7-1/4-Inch Multipurpose Cutting Blade) every month or so, but the tool just performs poorly.\n\nI’ve just discovered that I have the budget to upgrade to a cold-saw and I’m giving some serious thought to the Grizzly 10\" Slow-speed, Cold Saw . Though the Baleigh 9\" cold saw would probably work also.  Room in the shop is tight, but I can put one of these on the table where the current chop-saw is. My goals are:\n\nAbility to cut aluminum accurately\n\nAbility to cut soft-steel (only needed rarely), preferably without sparks\n\nProduce a cut-face that does not require refacing on the mill\n\nTool that is quieter\n\nTool with a stage that holds the part firmly (and doesnt bend (!!!) when you try to clamp a tube)\n\nAbility to perform accurate angled miter cuts\n\nEverything I have read suggests that a coolant-based cold saw will meet these needs, but I have not used one.\n\nI’ve read many discussions about horizontal bandsaws, but I find bandsaws can’t cut straight.  We had a little Milwaukee that we also inherited that produced poor (slanted) cuts in even 1/2\" shaft stock.  But even so, we don’t have room for a good quality horizontal bandsaw.\n\nI also read about the non-cooled cold-saws ( example ), but they seem no better than the Evolution saw that we are replacing.  It just seems to me that a coolant-based system would produce a better cut.\n\nQuestions:\n\nWhat is a good saw to meet the above requirements given a $2K budget?\n\nHas anyone used the table-top Grizzly or Baileigh cold-saws?\n\nIs there anything that I am missing in this discussion?\n\nThank you.

When you say you want something that can cut “accurately,” could you expand on that word?  You could quantify it, for example +/- 0.01 inches?  If you’re not sure about the number, you could specify a use-case, for example “for frame members that butt against each other.”  I think a more specific set of goals might help you find a solution that fits better.\n\nIf your goals are similar to our goals, then I think “refacing on the mill” (or lathe) will become part of your workflow, and the choice of initial cutter won’t matter much.",

For each machine it all depends on what you are intending to do with them.  Please watch the series of videos that Evolution has available, they are incredible!\n\nI have grown to love the Evolution series of saws - but each has its benefits and drawbacks.\n\nHowever - all have the same drawback - the noise. Please note that you are cutting metal with metal no matter how it is tipped. And steel blades through aluminum is especially loud. That is the nature of the beast.\n\nAs for your claim that the cut is “ragged”, I presume the operator is cutting too fast or the blade is dull. The former accelerates the latter over many cuts. As I coach my students, let the saw blade remove the material; in other words, cut slowly.\n\nAs for accuracy, these are cut off saws - and depending on the operation some are much better than others. Essentially all of the Evo series are nothing more than cutoff saws or power miter boxes like you would find in the wood shop or on construction sites. The accuracy is dependent on the person doing the measuring and cutting.\n\nAs for the most accurate facing, facing with the mill will always be best practice.\n\nWe have the last example you posted , and they are spectacular. Really light years ahead of any other saw we have in the shop.  To the point where the other chop saws (including the other Evos) are not even considered for use anymore.\n\nAnother point of experience: rarely am I impressed with anything Grizzly. I now know enough to stray far away from them.\n\nAnd as for accuracy with a bandsaw - any bandsaw - well, they are great for the woods lab or cutting stock to length before facing on the mill.",

It is not a tank.\n\nYou’re abusing the saw, both the blade and the clamp. We only go through about one blade per season on our rage4. We go through 12\" fine-finish blades much more quickly, primarily from students pushing too hard and getting too much feed per tooth and snapping teeth… As soon as one tooth goes, the rest of the blade quickly follows. If your bearings are starting to go out, that would also cause you to make bad cuts and go through blades quickly.\n\nYou won’t get better results with the same technique on a different saw in the same cost class.\n\nThere are cold saws with heavier vises, coolant systems, etc set up for stationary shop use. They run thousands of dollars. Students will destroy them just as quickly as they will a Rage4.\n\nI suspect that what you actually want is a mill and a lathe for finishing the ends of the tubes/shafts to true flat? 90% of our robot comes straight off the Rage4 and into assembly, but there are a few places where it’s nice to really dial in the cut.\n\nHave you used a lathe or mill much before? There are folks closer to you that might be worth visiting for a lesson, but if you can’t line up one of them come up to Richmond on a Friday afternoon…\n\nEdit: with a budget of $2k, I’d be looking at the upgraded Evo dry cold saw plus a Harbor Freight lathe before the tiny Baileigh. Tiny Baileigh could be sweet, but I don’t like dealing with coolant - ymmv. If you can scrape together a little more, a LittleMachineShop mill is more likely to be a game change in quality.",

Pre-drilled tubing with no further machining does not need precise cuts, .100” tolerance is fine for getting the right number of holes. If you are post machining, facing the ends takes very little extra effort. Maybe if you’re next process is welding there is some need for accuracy, but not very much if you’re using decent fixtures.\n\nThat said nice saw cuts do at least make your parts look good. I’d recommend a nice miter saw. We use a Dewalt 12”. I’d highly recommend regular applications of stick lube for aluminum. Listen to the saw if the blade is slowing down while you cut, you’re pushing too hard.",

You do need to adjust them (once ever or again only if abused), but I can get within +/- 1/8\" without looking and within +/- 0.050\" without extreme effort and that’s good enough for most things in FRC . For the things that aren’t, I go a little oversized and finish it on the mill or lathe.\n\nYou say you don’t have the space (and I can’t really refute that), but I’d get rid of a lot of tools before I gave up our bandsaw. (We also build mostly out of 80/20, so it’s particularly useful for that.)\n\nPS: For round stock, get a V-block (or multiples for different sizes) to aid in clamping on three points, one flat and two in the V. (This might be obvious, but you specifically called out issues with clamping tubes above.)",

You’d be there forever trying to cut aluminum with those cold saws you linked. They are more of a horizontal bandsaw replacement for ferrous materials.\n\nWe were using my personal RAGE4 until upgrading to a Dewalt dw872 mounted to a SMW fixture table (now Haasbok ) and its been pretty great. We use a variety of Strong Hand clamps and made a nice recessed table for the saw.\n\nIts also obnoxiously loud but it cuts great. When it was setup in our main work area we required everyone in the room to wear hearing protection and the operator to yell ‘cutting’ before each cut to avoid startling anyone. We’ve since moved in to a large back closet which has helped with the noise. Hanging moving blankets on the walls around the saw also helps a ton with the noise.",

The clamps are sized for longer pieces of metal. You will need a high tooth count blade for the thin shapes. To a cold saw 1/8\" is thin.\n\nThe chop saws intended for would will cut aluminum with carbide tipped blades. The cutting speed is high so they are a little scary. I don’t let student routinely use the wood chop saw for safety reasons. You can find chop saw intended for metal that have a lower RPM . If you are going through a blades faster that a build season, you are doing something wrong or have the wrong blade. The chop saw leaves a square cut with a finish only marginally worse than the mill. We only finish on the mill if the precise length is critical.\n\nFor regular student use, we use a band saw with a 3/4 blade. It is a lot safer the chop saw. It is also the quietest option. It cuts reasonably straight and square when properly tensioned. It can cut the occasional steel piece. We run HSS blades without lubricant. We get decent life from them. If we were to cut more steel I would bimetal blades.We use v blocks for cutting round shapes.",

                    "cooked": "Our team use vertical band saws. They are pretty accurate. I personally can often get the accuracy within .0625’’ when cutting 2:1’’ aluminum tubes. You mentioned that horizontal band saws can’t cut straight. We did experience this. The blade tends to wiggle a little on horizontal band saws. but not so much on veridical ones. On a vertical band saw, you can just put the part on a plate and push it into the blade with your hands. will still tend to wiggle but you can adjust that with your hands by slightly moving the part. You can also tension the belt shaped blade a bit more to reduce wiggleness. On a vertical band saw, You don’t even need to clamp the part. which means the time it takes to cut a part is shorter. The average time it takes for me to cut an 1:2’’ aluminum tube is like 10 seconds. Although it sounds quite dangerous it’s actually pretty safe. unless your hand somehow slips into the blades you are not getting hurt easily. Some vertical band saws have protection rails which makes them even safer. And band saws are pretty quiet too. The vertical ban saw that I was using was small. It’s not as strong as a  big one which means it’s a bit slower when cutting. But it’s portable. we would bring it to the pits Durning competitions. although it’s small. it cuts well. We would even use it to cut steel screws. It cuts a screw in like 3 seconds without a single spark. After cutting a part. we would often take the part to a belt sander to sand it down exactly to there we wanted. We cut the part a little bit longer that needed then sand off the extra. In this was, I can sometimes stack two sanded parts side to side and I can hardly tell the height difference with my naked eye. For small parts with in 5in, the inaccuracy is mostly within half a millimeter. However, the accuracy on a vertical band saw can vary greatly from person to person depending on experience.  For some of our freshmen on the team, they can cut a part that is 0.625’’ off.",

Cuts are clean with minimal burrs and very little touch ups needed to be useable parts.  The clamp on  ours is usable with thinner material and it clamps tubing just fine.\n\nI have found the noise it makes to be better (much more quiet) than a high speed chop saw.  It might cut a little slower, but I’m happy we inherited it from our middle schools shop when they removed a bunch of old equipment.  We get coolant donated from a local machine shop after they have used it or if they have a little concentrate left that they won’t miss they will let us have a gallon or so that last us for the season.\n\nIt is a big, heavy saw.  We are fortunate to have our shop connected to our schools Industrial Tech shop and we keep it there.",

It is Loud so hearing protection and “EARS” warning call outs are required in the shop. Precision from the experienced students are probably only +/-.015\" but on a 34\" elevator tube that’s good enough, more important usually they’re all the same length and that’s easy enough to check.\n\nAnything that’s short enough to fit on the Bridgeport and is important to be exact on length gets rough cut (~+1/16\") on the saw and indicated and milled to length on the Bridgeport before it heads to the 3 axis.",
