The additional information below the table:\n\nWires that are recommended by the device manufacturer or originally attached to legal devices are considered part of the device and by default legal. Such wires are exempt from this rule, provided they are powered by the smallest value fuse or breaker which permits proper device operation.\n\nServes to exempt wiring attached to the device or recommended for use by the manufacturer from the tables sizing requirements - but I don’t read that as requiring the wiring used downstream of a voltage regulator (or other custom circuit with team-not- COTS -wiring), to need fuse/circuit breaker protection.\n\nWould wiring off a VRM then need additional downstream protection before reaching the powered device? (edit: this is explicitly allowed by the table 8.4?)\n\nR621 deals with protecting circuits with appropriate sized circuit breakers/fuses. The blue box language is particularly illuminating, I think pointing out that additional downstream fuses/breakers from the PDP / PDH /PDP2.0 are not prohibited, but also not explicitly required.\n\nThis rule does not prohibit the use of smaller value breakers in the PDP /PDP2.0/ PDH or any fuses or breakers within CUSTOM CIRCUITS for additional protection. Fans permitted per R501 may also be included within CUSTOM CIRCUITS.\n\nI’m going to take a bit longer to think about this before editing/responding and adding more because I do see some loopholes here unless covered by another rule I’m not seeing.",

From my current rule-reading I think for 18AWG wire an up-to 20A circuit protection device as the output from the PDP / PDH /PDP2.0 is technically the only required circuit protection device…but I’m taking more time thinking through the intent and physics of failure.\n\nAdding a fuse to the output of the DC-DC for the smaller gauge wire in a USB-C pigtail would not be AGAINST the rules and would provide more protection for more of the wires in the custom circuit…but I dont know that its explicitly required and I’m thinking it should be but I’m not seeing where in the rules that’s stated?\n\nWhat exact DC-DC voltage regulator are you using? What is its max rated current/power output?",

We need to go to POWER and convert:\n\nV=IxR P=VxI\n\nSo a 10A fuse on the 12V distribution bus of the PDP / PDH /PDP2.0 will allow nominally 120W\n\nThen the output of your DC-DC is 5V, so solving for I in P=VxI means 120=5xI…I=24A\n\nSo that upstream 10A fuse wont blow until the output of the DC-DC is pulling more than 24A at 5V DC.\n\nSince your selected DC-DC is rated for 5.5A continuous (it could and will supply more for a shorter amount of time up to a limit…that limit or short circuit output current is not listed on the specs page for the device however…lets assume its 10A for this analysis) - that means your downstream wiring is essentially got a free circuit protection device at 10A.  This puts you at needing an 18AWG >=22AWG (per @paulonis and table 8.4 R622), wire on the output with no additional circuit protection.\n\nEdit: See later reply for a convergent recommendation that happens to be the same last sentence in the above paragraph.\n\nTo be safe I would wire the output with 18AWG or if using it with a smaller wire gauge downstream ensuring that wiring complies with R622 - in the case of 24AWG then using an additional 2A fuse or circuit breaker on the output of the DC-DC to protect that downstream 24AWG wire.",

Such wires are exempt from this rule, provided they are powered by the smallest value fuse or breaker which permits proper device operation.\n\nThe argument being that the Orange Pi uses a USB-C input implying the use of any COTS USB-C cable is “recommended” by the manufacturer.\n\nThose USB-C cables contain as low as 24AWG wire. So that is logically “recommended” by the manufacturer.\n\nThen…by rule you must power the device with the smallest value fuse/breaker which permits proper device operation:\n\n5V@4A means a 4A fuse/breaker on the output of the DC-DC…or a 2A fuse/breaker at the MPM on the 12V side powering the DC-DC as that is the smallest size fuse that will allow >20W (5Vx4A=20W, 12Vx2A=24W), needed by the OrangePi.",

Choose >= 22AWG wire for the input and output, and a 10A fuse or 5A breaker or lower.\n\nOthers who may be using different DC-DC converters may have different needs, i.e. a higher power DC-DC .\n\nThat particular device can supply 15A on its output, so it would need a 20A fuse and 18AWG wire on its output, even if it were supplied with 20AWG and a 10A fuse on the input…which I wouldn’t recommend due to voltage drop but it would be rule compliant.",
