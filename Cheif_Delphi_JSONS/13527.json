As of right now our cading program is going to be OnShape mainly because of how its accessible from Chromebook. From what I’ve heard from those who are working on OnShape, they state that it is really slow and can’t handle large files. We use the edu version of OnShape if that means anything. Is there anything that can be done to help this issue or fix it? Or any tips ion general that could help to make our cading go smoother?",

For FRC, Onshape isn’t really slow unless you make it slow.\n\nBe EXTREMELY deliberate with part studio, feature, and feature script usage as well as deriving parts. It’s fine to have subassemblies and even multiple subassemblies in one part studio (switching between part studios is a waste of time), but if it gets too big or complex you gotta split it.\n\nFeaturescripts love to eat into load times, but they also can be huge time savers. Definitely a double-edged sword you gotta consider.\n\nFor example, the gusset feature script + tube converter featurescripts can be useful, but both can add insane amounts of load time if used multiple times, especially with gussets. You can get away with designing the gusset yourself quickly, so you can skip it, especially if you know it will be a bigger document.\n\nDesign simple, have a decent computer and wifi and understand how features impact your document load time are all important.\n\nI would recommend splitting into multiple documents anyway, as it’s good for versioning purposes and load times too.\n\nYou can also play with sketches and deriving to optimize load times, but it’s kind of a hassle to learn.\n\nWhen it comes to parametric multi-part modeling, there are lots of ways to approach saving time, though its a careful balance between deriving the right parts, utilizing master sketches, and modeling in context of other parts, as well as making sure your sketches and CAD are as parametric as possible (easy to edit) to make sure that you can quickly fix issues that arrive, and iterate on cad as you get more information.\n\nNo reason to have 15 part studios for an intake when you can have a single-part studio, an assembly, and a folder for imported parts. Reducing the number of part studios you use will massively help with saving time as you don’t need to switch and cognitively keep track of each thing, but on the other hand, it can punish you for poor feature use more frequently as load times stack.\n\nFor the majority of teams, though, it’s probably min-maxing to a high level. You can get away with a loooot of stuff for FRC as long as you design a robot or two, and learn stuff on the way through survival CAD, go through the onshape fundamentals and top-down design pathways. You should be fine. CAD efficiency isn’t too much of a problem if you have multiple designers, or designing a dead simple robot. (always design simple)",

Getting away from dimensions as much as possible opting instead to use sketch relationships to define geometry. That way if you need to make changes you aren’t changing 800000 different dims more so a few misc ones like ball size, shooter height etc.",

The CAD is more accessible while still having everything necessary to ensure there are no delays.\n\nI doubt even you are cadding every single detail, most designers will purposely leave stuff out if they know they don’t need it.\n\nShow me some of your CAD if I’m wrong, that has every single fastener, wire, and detail in which you were able to, and tell me how accessible it was for your team.",

That makes sure there’s clearance for bolt heads in any tight spaces and gives us a better weight estimate while still saving time and processing resources. We use almost entirely standard bolt sizes that we buy before the season so we don’t have to worry about including bolts on the BOM, but this would allow for that as well. It also means that when we go to assemble the system the assemblers know what size bolts they’ll need for where instead of having to measure in the CAD. IMO it’s a pretty good middle ground.",
