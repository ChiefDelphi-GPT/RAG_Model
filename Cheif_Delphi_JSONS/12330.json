                    "cooked": "We’re having a debate about how to design a wrist that is both strong enough and light enough. Our general design is pivot between two masts, telescoping extender off the pivot, with gripper on a wrist at the end of the extender.\n\nSince this group of students (& I) have not really designed a motor-powered pivot or wrist before (only pneumatics), my approach this year has been to research past robots, design/CAD some concepts, and then share with others so they can do further design iterations. Out of that the debate has sprung…\n\nMy v1 wrist seemed too heavy, using a Neo and Maxplanetary + chain/sprocket drive, and a different mentor proposed a much lighter weight design using the AM snowblower motor direct driving a hex shaft through the tube to which the gripper is connected. Reading about that motor, I’m concerned it will break, and I’m looking for a middle ground solution that is lighter than my v1 but still strong enough. I’m down to a few possibilities, and I would appreciate help from others with more experience. I estimate the torque from the gripper weight will be between 5 to 10 ft-lbs (not counting impacts and encounters with immovable objects). I’d really like to move us off the idea of using the snowblower motor.\n\nCurrent middle ground ideas to drive wrist:\n\nNeo550 (current limited to 20A) + Ultraplanetary (25:1) + sync belt + 3D printed pulleys (maybe another 2:1 reduction) with one pulley bolted to the gripper tube being rotated. Again need structure / 2 outer bearings. -->Question on this one: UP 25:1 is near the UP’s load limit with a Neo550… If I add a 2:1 reduction using pulleys, am I putting that outer 5:1 UP stage at risk (or will Onyx pulleys not be strong enough)?\n\nNeo550 + Sport 57 100:1… This one may be it.\n\nOr maybe I can drive a hex shaft and have the hex shaft rotate the tube using one of options above rather than bolting pulley to tube?\n\nThanks",

You could mount the wrist motor/gearbox further up on the arm and use a timing belt or chain to transfer the power to the wrist. I can CAD an example of this if it would be of benefit to you.\n\nIf you’re feeling particularly brave, you can do something adjacent to what 971 did in 2018 , with the gearbox for the wrist mounted in the drivetrain with a timing belt ran through the entire length of the arm and then continuously updated via software to remain in sync with the arm. I’ve attached a picture of this which I pulled from their technical binder . 971 graciously supplies their CAD files as well, so those are available for inspiration.\n\n971 2018 ArmWrist 612×635 119 KB .\n\n971 2018 ArmWrist 612×635 119 KB\n\n971 2018 ArmWrist 612×635 119 KB",
