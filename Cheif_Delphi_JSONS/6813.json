                    "cooked": "So my team built imo a great robot this year, but we found that our CAD took a long time to finish.\n\nNow, part of the issue was that the internet at my school went down for a few days after a flood of our server room, so we had no access to onshape. We also didn’t have a lot of people on CAD team.\n\nSo what I’m wondering is how to train people to CAD a good robot quickly. I found that a lot of people trying to help CAD were designing them in a way that was bad or just physically impossible, so I want to try and educate new students with better FRC specific CAD. I’d also want to hear tips of how you organize your CAD team so we can work together and design a seamless robot a lot faster since miscommunication also caused a bit of delay.\n\nEdit: I appreciate everybody’s advice and it should prove invaluable.\n\nI realized I have some extra questions:\n\nHow do you design a superstructure on your robot?\n\nWhat featurescripts and add-ons do you suggest for onshape for FRC ?\n\nHow in depth should you go with the CAD?\n\nHow do you organize the onshape file itself? Our teams CAD project was heavily disorganized this past year",

                    "cooked": "Here’s a quick overview of our CAD workflow (and some explanations, happy to clarify further).\n\nWe decided on a single end effector, it works similar to the Unqualified Quokkas but with a wrist DOF and a “shamping” inspired mechanism. final_endeffector 1016×1110 360 KB\n\nfinal_endeffector 1016×1110 360 KB\n\nfinal_endeffector 1016×1110 360 KB\n\nDecide on your constraints, these will drive your design: Design Objectives\n\nThough we have a wrist, we wanted our design to be able to intake / shoot from subwoofer / amp as if the wrist was a virtuable 4 bar (at a single angle)\n\nVariable Constraints (typically prototyped values)\n\nIntake compression at 1.75\"\n\nShooter compression at 1.5\"\n\nBased on these constraints, we create a “master sketch”\n\nHere’s our master sketch zoomed in on the end effector, you can see the variable constraints (yellow highlights), note path (orange highlights), and rules/other mechanisms (pink highlights) driving the design. image 1076×948 112 KB\n\nimage 1076×948 112 KB\n\nimage 1076×948 112 KB\n\nAnd here’s the rest of the master sketch. We use an arm to move the end effector around, so it’s arc swing needed to be able to move it such that it could shoot perpendicular at the center of the speaker from the subwoofer and position the end effector such that it met our amping constraints. mastersketch2 1106×960 174 KB\n\nmastersketch2 1106×960 174 KB\n\nmastersketch2 1106×960 174 KB\n\nFrom there we break off into deriving these features into individual part CADs. Here’s an example for our end effector plate (this is very dense, I apologize in advance). I’m focusing on the end effector because that’s the design I was most heavily involved in. image 1364×1220 174 KB\n\nimage 1364×1220 174 KB\n\nimage 1364×1220 174 KB\n\nYou can see our 3 motors  in the middle left, 1 per set of shooter wheels (the way our shamping works, the bottom roller needs to be able to reverse directions), and 1 driving the 3 intake rollers. I’ll focus on the intake power distribution for simplicity. You can see the pitch circle for the motor pinion to that hub (check the top explanation section for a 3D view), then the pitch circle for the front intake roller’s gear, and then lines to the two smaller rollers for belts. The position of that hub is driven by keeping those belts lengths nice and being able to gear to the front roller. Then obviously there’s a bunch of circles for bearing holes. An additional constraint was added here (for power distribution), that intake is geared intentionally to make the surface speed of that big roller roughly match the drivebase speed, which typically makes intaking work better https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDlHGhKHIdM .\n\nOnce we’ve got physical parts driven from the design, we need to mate them together into an assembly. These mates are driven by the constraints from your master sketch, so some people opt to actually constrain to that master sketch. I could talk on and on and on about constraint theory, but the main thing is you have a single “fixed” part, in this case it’s that plate I just designed. Everything else is constrained to that fixed part, or to something else fully constrained to that fixed part. The biggest outcome of this is your designs will be naturally parametric, because you constrained intentionally rather than arbitrarily. So if you change one of your driving dimensions (i.e. intake compression) or something, your entire assembly shouldn’t break (unless your design has majorly changed). As an example, the motor mount for the shooters is constrained with two cyclindrical mates to the holes in the plate, and then constrained planar to that plate (cylindrical + revolute is equally valid), this makes sense because it’s actually constrained that way by bolts.\n\nimage 1154×926 108 KB\n\nimage 1154×926 108 KB\n\nimage 1154×926 108 KB\n\nThink about why a parts have the dimensions they do. The biggest feature here is the derive tool and create part studio in context  / edit in context. A spacer needs to cause a pulley to line up with another one? Constrain the pulley to be in line with the other one, created a measured variable for that pulley to the next item axially, and extrude the spacer with that measured variable.\n\nI know this is a lot, so if you have any questions please reach out",

Once you have an agreed-upon, understood preliminary sketch, the best way I’ve found to work together is to split up components and very early on figure out the fastening points between subsystems. All of your work should be fairly easy to adjust to a different size if you figure out something was off a bit so try to define only the important things in your sketches.\n\nFor our 2023 robot, we built out from the frame like this\n\nChassis Linear slide Intake arm Superstructure Limelight Mount Virtual Four Bar Arm Gripper Various 3DP Components\n\nLinear slide Intake arm\n\nIntake arm\n\nSuperstructure Limelight Mount Virtual Four Bar Arm Gripper\n\nLimelight Mount\n\nVirtual Four Bar Arm Gripper\n\nGripper\n\nVarious 3DP Components\n\nIt’s best to have the people with the most experience work on things closer to the frame and finish for manufacturing quickly as everything else is dependent on that. For anyone who is somewhat new to CAD, I highly suggest simple subsystems that are close to the end of a branch (we only had three CAD gremlins in 2023 so we couldn’t break it up as much as ideal)\n\nFinal tips:\n\nTry to use simplified COTS components and reduce the detail level on parts wherever possible if internet is an issue or if your computers are not for pro gaming\n\nDon’t put everything in CAD. Fab crew should be able to improvise fasteners, bearings, spacers, etc.\n\nYou should be communicating regularly outside of meetings with the entire subteam\n\nIt should hurt your soul to add a DoF",

The real thing is how to make an intake plate, a motor mount, …… so you’ll can build subcomponents. Once you can do that then it’s a matter of integration of components example this year being how to get a note from intake to the shooter and anything in between. 2d sketches help, block cad helps, just drawing with pencil and paper helps. The thing that takes the longest in my experience is making sure what you cad once built will hold up and looking at failure modes before things are built unless you have a very high resource team that prefers a trial and error method with something physical but that’s rare and regardless not really ideal. The other longest part again is integration. One good thing to look at is other teams cad. And there’s a bunch of things you can do I can go on and also look up similar threads on here, they have more information on this that I could ever tell you. Good luck (also one big thing I just remembered is designing the entire robot as a team and if you have different people working on different components make sure there is a plan (ideally block cad and/or 2d sketch) as to how those components will integrate.",

                    "cooked": "CuteRedpandas:\n\nHow do you design a superstructure on your robot?\n\nFirst I want to define superstructure. I consider superstructure to be anything that doesn’t directly accomplish a game task (so nothing that touches a note nor the drivebase), but instead positions the things that do. The first step in designing the super structure is to know where everything else is / how it’s going to move. You can then derive your super structure (I cannot emphasize enough the value of “edit in context” and “create part studio in context”, those are onshape terms but every CAD software I’ve used has analogues).\n\nCuteRedpandas:\n\nWhat featurescripts and add-ons do you suggest for onshape for FRC ?\n\nFRC specific: MKCad (a library of FRC components) and KrayonCAD (KrayonCAD is weird, it’s distributed as someone’s document that’s publicly available). Other: I’ve created my own documents I import parts from for the standards my team uses, I’ve got parametric pulleys, gears, spacers, etc. in there. Look into onshape’s configuration panel (on the right toolbar), it’ll let you specify variables (i.e. tooth count on a gear) when you import an item, so I can have one file that’s all the gears in my assembly because they’re customized instances of it.\n\nCuteRedpandas:\n\nHow in depth should you go with the CAD?\n\nI like to CAD absolutely everything; even bolts because it forces you to consider that someone actually has to install said bolt, so it has to be accessible. You can use that configuration tool I was talking about earlier to configure certain states of your CAD (i.e. intake position, shooting position) with multiple mates configured to certain positions, which is likely to make your programmers happy when they’re developing state machines. To do that last bit, make sure you’re constraining moving things correctly. For our arm, it’s a revolute mate with angle bounds, so it is fully constrained (every DOF is specified), but it can be moved.",

Honestly I just need to write up a white paper, but there’s “high level design” and “low level design”. High level design is things like constraint analysis and black-box design (i.e. what the robot will do, not how the robot will do it). Low level design then focuses on accomplishing the goals set forth in higher level designs. This is a gradient, not discrete levels. Generally, you work from high to low. In my opinion, the whole team should be involved in the higher levels, and then reduce down in terms of focus in lower levels (though make sure you’re training people!).\n\nWithin the lower levels, where it was me and the other design person (and mentors), I’ve generally split up by mechanism. This year, I focused on the end effector, the other designer focused on the arm. What’s notable here is that even though I was responsible for the end effector and he was responsible for the arm, we both were heavily involved in the other’s design. Just like you’d loop in someone the mechanical sub-team to make sure you’re designing for manufacturing, you loop in the other designers to make sure your parts remain compatible and that you get other perspectives and that your parts are working together properly.",
