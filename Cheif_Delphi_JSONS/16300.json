                    "cooked": "My son just joined First this year, and it’s a great group of kids and parents.  However, the rule for coding has been “as little as possible” for many years.  I have a MS in ICS and am more than happy to share what I know and grow the team, but I’m at a bit of a loss as to where to start.\n\nThere’s a few kids who have done the coding.  Mostly in LabView because they could recycle that code, and last year they tried C++. However, it seems it was mostly copy-paste code.  I’m thinking of just switching to Java for a fresh start. The challenge is going to be trying to teach when they already “know” how to do it. Any tips?\n\nThe second part is just personally comprehending the API myself.  I don’t know what I don’t know.  I’m new to robotics so accessing motors, sensors, or ??? is just currently nonsensical to me. For instance, I saw code for differential drive (stay with me experienced friends). This brings up: what is that? What does it do? What other kinds of drives are there? What inputs/outputs? And finally does any of that matter or am I just going to make the function call once and forget it?\n\nI don’t actually need any of those questions answered specifically so much as I need to know:  what do I need to know and where can I find it? I have gone through all the software info on the First website but things are not very clear since I don’t know the hardware side.  I’m hoping someone has some insights.\n\nLastly, I’m wondering if there’s any quirks to this type of coding.  I’m used to lots of function calls and nesting to enhance readability and reuse, but I don’t know how much efficiency is a priority.\n\nAny thoughts on any of this would be helpful.",

Basically, your next month will be a crash-course in vocabulary and all the details of robot hardware.\n\nSome specific things to start with:\n\nWpilib’s Zero to Robot should give a good walkthrough of the basic steps required to get a robot up and running. For you, this is an overview of the basic and minimum steps you’ll be taking to make your software do meaningful things on an FRC robot.\n\nThe hardware components overview is also great - again, think of it as a vocab and basic component placement lesson. Understanding the hardware getting programmed will be key to understanding what to write for programming.\n\nKeep in mind - the vast majority of teams get by with very little code - examples and discussion you find here and on the FRC discord server reflect a very small subset of the community. Most of the people have very grey beards, metaphorically or literally.\n\nYour team’s lead mentors may be able to get you access to FIRST ’s recently released programming courseware , which has gotten some decent reviews on its content so far.\n\nAs another sample, here’s the offseason training we’ve been working our team through . Take it with a grain of salt - it’s far from perfect, too big and too wordy for biting off quickly, and refers to a lot of development techniques and tools specific to our team. But, it does reflect a purposeful pedagogy that is intended to bring a student up from zero to “just dangerous enough to make a good robot”.",

Python (and other splitoffs such as Kotlin and Rust) will work, but if you have any issues, the FTA ’s will only help for the languages that are officially supported (Java, C++, and LabView). You may be able to get help from teams? But looking at previous years breakdowns of who is using what language, Python is an extremely small subset of teams (small being 77 teams in 2019 ).\n\nTo your questions, the WPILib docs are what you should check out first. Many teams also upload their code to GitHub, so you can see the wide array of how teams code, from the basics to the cutting edge of the programming spectrum. I shouldnt need to tell you to build program within your means though.",

Whatever language you decide to use, (…cough, cough, JAVA!!!, cough…) running through the Zero to Robot tutorial is a quick introduction and also a big confidence booster. It’s the “Hello, World!” of FRC.\n\nAnd while you’ll learn the most from wiring up a Roborio on a sheet of plywood, no CD thread would be complete without somebody mentioning the Romi. The Romi is a small Arduino+Raspberry Pi robot that can be programmed using the same tools, languages, and WPILib libraries as a full-size FRC robot. They are relatively inexpensive, and I usually recommend sending one home with every student or mentor who is interested in programming.\n\nOf course there are differences between working with the Romi and working with a full-size robot, but being able to test your robot coding skills in the comfort of your own living room is an enormous benefit. Speaking for myself, I never completed my own personal “Zero to FRC Robot” journey until I had a Romi .\n\nYou can order FIRST-approved Romis (Romii?) direct from Pololu.\n\nThis robot based on the Romi chassis and 32U4 control board provides a platform that FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition) students can program using the full suite and libraries that are used to program competition robots, making it a great teaching tool...",

Was in same spot 5 years ago.\n\nWPILib team does/did an excellent job with both the software and the documentation.\n\nI have zero hesitation recommending you switch to Java.\n\nThe VScode plug-ins are awesome. So are the examples.\n\nThe command based framework is something to quickly learn and embrace.  Beginner programmers don’t need to know how the whole thing works to be productive.\n\nROMI is a great suggestion so you aren’t waiting on the build team, which is waiting on the CAD team, which is waiting on…. Gives you a dedicated platform for learning and teaching the structure of the code.\n\nBook mark the Java doc pages listed here…. Hasn’t been updated for this season…\n\nCommon-Links\n\nContribute to RossRambotics/2021-Amperage development by creating an account on GitHub.\n\nReach out whenever you have a question…. If you are writing a lot of code you are probably doing it wrong…",

C++ is pretty easy to teach as long as you don’t program like it’s 1999 with manual memory allocation and pointers. Basically, don’t write C++ like a Java programmer.\n\nHere’s how 3512 does it: Intro to C++ - FRC Team 3512 . The veteran students answer questions rookies have, and I wasn’t involved in training at all the last few years. Once you have examples of clean codebases, it’s pretty easy to pattern match it for future years.",
