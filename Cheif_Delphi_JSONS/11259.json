                    "cooked": "Our robot has 4 MK4i swerve modules with a cancoder on each module for the turning. The angle offsets for each cancoder are correctly loaded when the robot starts up, and the robot drives fine.\n\nHowever, after driving in teleop and performing auto routines for a certain period, one of the modules (back right) seems to randomly lose its alignment from the other wheels and stays at an incorrect, random angle. Then, as we drive in teleop after testing our auto, by going forwards and backwards the robot turns slightly and the wheels are getting continually off the desired angle (the most recent test we had the front right and back left become skewed). So there seems to be some disconnect with our desired wheel position.\n\nWe have redone the angle offsets for each module’s cancoder several times to no avail. We have checked the cancoder itself and its solder connections are fine. All of the CAN IDs for each cancoder are correctly assigned. The magnet in the module is superglued and secure. We installed a CANivore yesterday with all of the cancoders, swerve motors, and Pigeon 2 gyro on its network to reduce our CAN utilization.  We are thinking there might be a delay or something between the canivore and our drive code causing the intended absolute positions and the offsets to deviate.\n\nWhile the issue was occurring with the back right module, we disabled the robot and manually turned the wheel to the correct position, and the angle offset for the back right module is the same as its original value as defined in the code, but the issue persists until we manually realign the wheels while the robot is off; even if we redeploy code or power cycle the issue persists. We have found that the messed up wheel is offset the initial angle offset value, i.e. the initial angle offset value of the back right encoder is roughly 270 degrees and the back right module is 270 degrees “off” from the rest of the wheels.

If you are testing in shop and not running auto, you can also slap it in teleop init.\n\nPretty much what was happening is the motors grab their initial value from the CANCoder since it is an absolute value compared to the relative encoders in the wheels (At least for our NEO’s). The problem was the CANCoder’s weren’t fully booted up before the swerve modules tried to grab the value, so it defaulted to the default value of the motor with the offset applied (May explain why your offset is 270 and it was off by 270 degrees). Which from your reference of a delay, sounds like you guys already suspected this.\n\nOne thing you can also test is connecting that method to a button so if it ever happens during testing or a match, you can press that button, and re-seed the motor encoders to realign everything properly.\n\nI hope this works, and if not, that it will give a new perspective on the problem that could lead to finding the necessary fix.",

Sometimes the robot veered and a back wheel was “dragging” at about 90 deg (could be 270) out of kilter while the other 3 were straight at 0/180 degrees.\n\nDidn’t happen often enough to track down and I attributed it to being at an edge case of full power on one side and 0 power on the other side. (We use essentially the WPILib SwerveBot example to drive.) I avoided that case and I never found anything amiss with any code.

Everything checked out when the robot was up on trolley.  The wheels were all free. they turned and rotated without issue.  That was because there was no back pressure on the belt.\n\nThe driver keep complaining about the robot pulling to one side and we keep testing everything OK.\n\nEventually we discovered the issue by trying to rotate the wheels while applying some resistance to the steering motor pinion.\n\nI believe this problem is more like to occur if you are running the 9mm belt instead of the 15mm belt.  The 9 mm belt comes from upgrading a Mk4 kit to a Mk4i with the upgrade pack.\n\nWe had a swerve module die last year (NB:It was our fault for leaving out a bearing) and it cost us two matches in the qualifications because it took us that long to get it sorted.  This time round we were prepared as we had a spare module ready to go with a single multi connection plug. We were able to swap the module, ID the motors and CANCoder and adjust the absolute offset on the CANCoder in a 4 match window without missing a match.  Well done 6508 pit crew.",

And for sure every 20ms a new absolute setting is sent so why wouldn’t the wheels be turned right no matter how screwy they were the iteration before?\n\nThe comments on a wheel being turned roughly 90/180 degrees from where it should be points to a potential problem with the optimize turn method failing on an edge case. Maybe it’s time to instrument that method. But again, why wouldn’t it self-correct within 20ms?\n\nAnother thought from other posts is the CANcode is failing to the 270 degree direction. Since our failures were when driving straight down field 180/0 degrees, a failure of the CANcoder with it registering 270 would give the 90 deg out of whack dragging wheel. Some sort of reset makes everything work okay again so the CANcoder couldn’t be permanently broken. Maybe CTRE like @bhall-ctre or @ozrien have some insight into how this could happen. I can’t find the post to refresh my memory describing the CANcoder being at 270 degrees.",

I can’t find the post to refresh my memory describing the CANcoder being at 270 degrees.\n\nUse case-wise, we see these typical usecases with swerve azimuth.\n\nTeams seeding Talons with CANcoders once (Phoenix 5)\n\nTeams using remote CANcoder (Phoenix 5 or Phoenix Pro), so Talon just uses last CANcoder value automatically when CANcoder publishes.  So no seeding necessary but the sensor bandwidth is limited by the CANcoder update rate.\n\nTeams using fused CANcoder (Phoenix Pro)  - where Talon fuses its internal sensor with external CANcoder.  This means no seeding and you get high bandwidth sensor data (best of both worlds).\n\nIn the circumstances we’ve seen in our support calls / emails, the issues are typically\n\nteams using CANcoder’s getPosition() when they really mean to call getAbsolutePosition()\n\nCalling the getter once inside a constructor, which can fail because our library has just loaded / CAN frames have not been received yet.  Check return getLastError/getLastTimeStamp appropriately to ensure fresh data.\n\nnot handling when a talon breaker-resets, which can be detected via API or self-test.\n\nphysical issue, slippage, magnet out of field, etc.\n\nforgetting to apply correct sensor offsets, either thru configs or locally.  In the case of configs, make sure to check return codes so you know configs are successful.\n\nThe first three tend to only happen with use case 1, since the use case 2 and 3 recover automatically via the remote/fusion strategies.",

We super glue them in, but occasionally they seem to slip and then we have to re-glue them. We think it is just that we never did it good enough the first time, because we have now run an entire comp without an issue.\n\nI would 100% check that the magnet is secured if you have all of the other things identified by @ozrien taken care of.\n\nEdit: to check this we just take the CANCoder off and then use something metal to try to pull out the magnet.
