As we found how useful FeatureScripts were, I decided to learn myself and try to make some scripts that are more focused on what our design team valued in design.\n\nShaft Generator We decided to make our own shaft gen because we found that while Julia’s shaft gen was very useful we found that having hole callouts in drawings was a must. So I’ve made my own version that is simplified and doesn’t quite do as much, but it does have hole callouts which makes drawings much faster.\n\nShaft Generator We decided to make our own shaft gen because we found that while Julia’s shaft gen was very useful we found that having hole callouts in drawings was a must.

I designed the bearing gen to be able to generate any VEXPro bearing at a given origin, as well as have input values to generate your own bearing if it comes from a different dealer.\n\nBearing Generator The idea of the bearing gen is to make the process of getting a bearing into the part studio much faster than importing it from a file or MKCad. I designed the bearing gen to be able to generate any VEXPro bearing at a given origin, as well as have input values to generate your own bearing if it comes from a different dealer.\n\nBelt & Pulley Generator One of the main focuses of the belt and pulley gen is to be able to detect whether the center distance was accurate to the belt. While it doesn’t round the belt to a commonly supplied belt, it is much easier to find a working center distance for whatever belt and pulley setup is done. The generator can do HTD5, GT2 2mm, and GT2 3mm belts and pulleys. With multiple options for a bore as well as the flange sizes.\n\nBelt & Pulley Generator One of the main focuses of the belt and pulley gen is to be able to detect whether the center distance was accurate to the belt.

The main positive of the Bearing Generator is it allows you to easily generate custom bearings with the same information that any imported or generated bearing will have (dimensions, steel material, and part number). I personally find the Bearing Generator much easier and more efficient to use rather than importing and transforming a bearing that may be needed in a part studio as well (its also much faster generation time).",

This update was focused on preparing the Belt & Pulley Generator for the season featuring:\n\nUpdated tooth generation for pulleys to the same accuracy as mkCAD.\n\nImproved center to center distance check to the same quality as West Coast Products calculator.\n\nBelts are now automatically rounded to the nearest tooth count by intervals of 5 as most COT belts in FRC are, but this can also be easily disabled in the UI.\n\nImproved “Fit Adjustment” processing.\n\nReworked origin computations, as well as “Single Pulley” generation only requires one origin selection.\n\nFixed offsets generated by different flange width’s.\n\nFixed situational extrusion bugs.\n\nChanged center distance report to display in inches.\n\nimage 969×56 7.98 KB\n\nimage 969×56 7.98 KB\n\nimage 969×56 7.98 KB\n\nimage 384×936 41.3 KB\n\nimage 384×936 41.3 KB\n\nimage 384×936 41.3 KB\n\nBefore tooth profile corrections:\n\nimage 944×1262 111 KB\n\nimage 944×1262 111 KB\n\nimage 944×1262 111 KB\n\nAfter tooth profile corrections:\n\nimage 1214×1251 109 KB\n\nimage 1214×1251 109 KB\n\nimage 1214×1251 109 KB\n\nAs always, if there are any bugs or improvement suggestions, feel free to message me!
