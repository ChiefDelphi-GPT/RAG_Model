We’ve seen how bad cable routing can cause all sorts of problems: loose connections, damaged wires, and even weird robot behavior during matches. So now we’re trying to be more intentional about how we do things.\n\nI wanted to open a discussion and learn from other teams:\n\nWhat tools or materials do you use for clean and reliable cable management?\n\nDo you have any go-to techniques or rules your team follows (e.g., labeling wires, CADing before, soldering)?\n\nAny cool tips for making electronics easier to debug mid-match?\n\nSome things we’re already using:\n\nZip ties (of course)\n\nHeat shrink for protecting connections\n\nWagos\n\ncable bundlers\n\nenergy belt\n\nI’d really love to hear how teams manage their electronics!",

I like anderson power poles more because\n\na) they’re a one and done kind of deal. after you crimp them on once, you can just slide them on whenever, and dont have to deal with bunched up wires from removing them from a connector a lot of times (think Spark MAX wires) b) you can ziptie powerpoles together so that they don’t slide off of each other c) they can b e slid together to make a big block of powerpoles that can be easily unplugged or plugged in together\n\nHowever, if you do plan on using WAGO’s, I really love this video from Team 11.\n\nSomething else that also helps is having nice wire that can easily be flexed around and moved. We had really crusty wire that was a pain to turn, until we got some new wire from PowerWerx, which has been 200% better since we can actually bend the damn thing.\n\nThere is also a lot of great information in this thread .",

(See this older catalogue , and for example part 200G3L .) They are designed for 10 AWG, fine-stranded wire, and ought to be crimpable with regular tools (TriCrimp or APP factory tooling). The maximum intended wire cross-sectional area is 6.0 mm 2 , instead of 5.3 mm 2 for the regular ones.\n\nUse a pair of tiny needle-nosed pliers, in the back of the housing and diagonally in the square corners, to grip the back of the contact and set it past the click of the housing spring. With small, stiff wire, you don’t need this; with flexible, large wire, it comes in very handy.\n\nMaybe tiny zip ties within the holes between the two housings would work for retention? This could be in addition to, or instead of the high detent force (high mating force) contacts, which aren’t as widely available and are difficult to error-proof. Strong clear tape with a sticky, no-residue adhesive, wrapped and with a little folded over tab for easy removal works pretty well too.",

Going around the outsize allows for larger zip ties too; I’ve found that the super-tiny ones are a bit more fiddly to source and install than standard ones.\n\nTo OP, 2102 sleeves everything , especially wires we don’t expect to handle often like bellypan wiring. It gives more protection to external runs, or can act like an outer sheath for moving cables. Being able to see major pathways to individual modules/mechanisms also helps a ton when troubleshooting.\n\nThe weight penalty is minimal when using thin stuff like split-loom sleeving . If you do sleeve wiring, work against hiding connectors inside sleeves. They’re surprisingly easy to forget to check when tracing wires.\n\nSeconding others; avoid wagos, hot glue small connectors that can’t easily be zip tied, and plan out wiring when designing your robot.",
