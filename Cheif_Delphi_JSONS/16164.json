This is primarily because of limited fabrication capabilities this year and less experienced students.\n\nIn preparation for this, our design team created a full model of the kitbot with bumpers, and a “practice” eboard. The eboard is intended to get the robot driving as soon as possible before our final eboard placement/design is finished.\n\nThe model can be found here: onshape model\n\nFeedback would be greatly appreciated.",

Being able to blast through configurations quickly really frees up a lot of labor that can be used to design other parts of your robot.\n\nHowever you go about it, good luck this year!",

                    "cooked": "AdamHeard:\n\nPersonally I’m not a fan of the stock wheels due to comparatively lower traction and spoke breaking issues.\n\nI’m curious when the spoke breaking issues you’re remembering happened; AndyMark has had two notable revisions of the 6\" HiGrip wheel over the years (compare the current am-0940b to the older am-0940a and it’s obvious how much beefier the webbing is).  I know how easy it is for us old-timers to have memories run together; I realized this afternoon that kids who played FIRST Power Up have all graduated.\n\nSince moving back to AM14U flavors for 2019, we haven’t had any breakages–and that includes 2019 where we had to replace clicking bearings before off-seasons because we were sending a tail-heavy robot off of level 2 of the habitat nearly every match for two regionals.  (And I’ll be honest, having worked the AndyMark booth for three Championship events when am-0940a existed I don’t remember any notable breakage help calls then either.)\n\nThe existing Colson options are not tailored great to the AM14U-style chassis–you’ll need hex bore ones in some places, you’ll need to press hubs in for others, then the belt pulleys will need their own solution figured out, and gah I hope all the spacers and Churro standoffs are still the right length.  It is a disservice to recommend that approach to a team who (and I say this with love) went 1-for-4 on district playoffs in 2018 and 2019, 0-for-2 on making PNW DCMP, and by their own admission has shrunken in resources since then.\n\nIf we get another 2016 game and the HiGrip wheels are truly of concern, I’d much sooner reach for the pneumatic wheel kits from AndyMark for a solution where my only requirement is to cut some churro to the length listed in the drawing, assemble, and then focus on problems that aren’t solved.",

While swapping wheels might be a reasonably simple upgrade to the KOP drivetrain, this is a bad recommendation to a team in this position.\n\nTeams (in a similar position), don’t start by customizing the KOP drivetrain.  Just build it straight from the kit and focus your efforts on a scoring mechanism.  If the field has a particularly difficult obstacle or you find issues in testing, then that’s the time for customizations.",
