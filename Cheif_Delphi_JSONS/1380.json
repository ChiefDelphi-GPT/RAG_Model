Our robot consistently has two wheels that are out of alignment with the others, which causes a lot of weird driving behavior such as dragging two wheels arcross the floor. The issue starts after we begin turning.\n\nI have attached a video of this behavior: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M02nO7HUtiPZahT8SB6fNFoQ_6O8T_32/view?usp=drive_link\n\nWe are running mk4n with YAGSL . For motors we are running Neos on steer and Neo vortex on drive.\n\nWhat We’ve Tried:\n\n-We switched from field-oriented to robot-oriented to rule out gyro-related issues. -We’ve redone our absolute encoder offsets multiple times, making sure to set them correctly, but we still see the same misalignment.\n\nHas anyone experienced something similar? If so how did you solve it?\n\nThanks!\n\n-Team 8701",

It’s really fast to test, just pull the CANCoder off and put something metal on the magnet.\n\nOtherwise it could be a bad encoder but I doubt it with two that are wrong. I haven’t had amazing success with YAGSL but I know lots of people have so I don’t have any insight about that.\n\nIf you could link code that would be nice, anyway good luck on the issue and I might be back. Oh also I think that video is account locked.",

I would ask the following questions:\n\nIs it always the same 2 modules? (Helps narrow down where the issue is)\n\nWhen they become misaligned, look at the Swerve drive view in AdvantageScope, what do the CANCoders say? Do they read as misaligned too or do they think they are pointed in the right direction? If they still think they are pointed in the right direction then either the magnet moved (see @BenjaminMiller 's solution) or their zero point is getting reset in software; check all the places where that method is used. If they move with the wheels and are showing as misaligned on the Swerve Drive view in AdvantageScope, check your “Target Angle” (AKA the angle that the wheel is told to turn to) which should also be shown in that view. Are they being told to go in that direction? Are they not? No matter the answer to that question, it sounds like an issue with YAGSL . Go through the 8 steps as you were shown at the Week 0 event, make sure you are using the correct version of YAGSL , update your firmware, etc.\n\nIf they still think they are pointed in the right direction then either the magnet moved (see @BenjaminMiller 's solution) or their zero point is getting reset in software; check all the places where that method is used.\n\nIf they move with the wheels and are showing as misaligned on the Swerve Drive view in AdvantageScope, check your “Target Angle” (AKA the angle that the wheel is told to turn to) which should also be shown in that view.
