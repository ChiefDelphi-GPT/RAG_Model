We did one 4-bar style intake, but it was chain driven and static so that when it was impacted it didn’t fold up.\n\nI’m wondering - what’s the drive mechanism people use to allow a 4-bar style intake to fold up when hit, but still be able to verify when it’s down or up.\n\nHere’s a screen shot of Poofs in 2022.  Their intake was constantly hitting walls and other robots and folding up without damage.  How do you actuate something like this with motors, but allow it to fold?\n\nimage 819×511 53.2 KB\n\nimage 819×511 53.2 KB\n\nimage 819×511 53.2 KB\n\nMy initial throught would be to spring it down, and use something like one way bearings and chain to actuate it up.  But I don’t think that’s how the better teams are doing it.",

Although if you are just running the intake into a hard stop when it’s out that could get more tricky…",

The “high pivot” 4-bars we saw in 2022 were easier to back drive when run into a wall because of how the forces passed through. Other 4 bars may be better candidates for compliant or “stretchy” links. Ideally you want to avoid relying on back-driving to protect your intake if forces will be anywhere near the overcentering point of the mechanism.",

First - if I’m actuating this thing quickly, pretty often it’s broken before the feedback of “too much current” is back and I can make a decision.  Second - I hate fixing what I think is a mechanical problem in code.\n\nFixing this issue in code is possible, but seems wrong to me:  this is primarily mechanical problem that feels like it should be addressed with design.  Pneumatics is the easy way, but most people have removed pneumatics now and it seems like and elegant motor solution would be out there somewhere.\n\nI suppose some type of friction clutch would work as well - a couple pieces of stacked polycarb tensioned together, etc.  Perhaps if you sprung the intake down, and pulled up with some dyneema.",

First - if I’m actuating this thing quickly, pretty often it’s broken before the feedback of “too much current” is back and I can make a decision. Second - I hate fixing what I think is a mechanical problem in code.\n\nI believe the best way to think about this feature is an additional line of defense. You should build your intake thinking it won’t collapse and should be able to take the hits nevertheless. In 2024 we had a pivoting intake that wouldn’t collapse and didn’t have too many issues as it was, even though we did smash it against the walls a bit.\n\nFor the 4 bar collapsing, the motion direction itself is your largest ally here. The more horizontal your movement direction is, the better. This way the forces would just be actuating directly against whatever is on the other side and then you can tune it to put as much spring force into resisting the movement as you find best. For sure you want at least some force keeping it open, gravity will do in a static environment, but with dynamic robot movement I would wager having something keeping it from bobbing up and down is good.\n\nThe main concern related to what is keeping the intake open are how strong it is (should be tunable ideally) and how linear it is. I would guess that pneumatics are probably the worst option since they would start putting up little effort (since the force of the cylinder would be a bit more radial on the arm pivot) and increase as you collapse in (as it gets more tangential). A motor should behave linearly (at least mechanically, not sure how the force the motor makes would vary because of the electrical effects off the top of my head). One good candidate is a spring / elastic pulling the 4-bar down/forward. In this case you would have a stronger force keeping it in place and avoiding small movements, but as the arms move inwards it can start being less effective and just allowing the intake to collapse as much as it needs if the force threshold has been breached.\n\nAs for using the motor as a spring, I would probably favor applying a small voltage to it constantly instead of a current limit. Low current limits could block your intake from opening/closing as fast as your motor is capable of. You could change the current limit for when it is supposed to move and when it is supposed to stay open, but changing this kind of config is normally a bit of a slower process on the controller and not something you want to be doing all the time mid match. Even just turning the motor off if it is open isn’t a terrible idea, but would just lead to a bit more bobbing.",

The only thing that you need to keep in mind is to have the contact point with the wall above your main axis of rotation for the “driving” arm of the geometry, to make it fold “up” instead of “down” and getting stuck. (on our 2022 1678 copycat intake we made the front axis movement entirely linear which is even better). Edit: as long as the lower axis point on the front portion of the four bar is above that arm’s rotation point, you’ll have a collapsing mechanism. Limiting current and putting in a pretty fast gear ratio works well. I’s what we did on Whisper and it worked out great. One of the only intakes we ever built that didn’t need any maintenance to work.\n\nGoogle Drive file.",

If the intake was stuck in for any reason, the clutch would slip and the motor wouldn’t burn out.\n\nThis sort of thing definitely can work, depending on the relative weight/resistance in the intake/arm.  Since it relies on friction, trying to lift a heavier arm with it may cause it to slip before it gets to the desired location, so it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution.",

We had surgical tubing that helps lift it up.\n\nTom_Line:\n\nAlso - it looks like your intake linkage is directly in line with the collision. Is the reason the intake pops up because your rollers hit the wall and lift it?\n\nThey’re not really in line, the main axis of rotation is below the bottom “front” axis point point on the arm and creates an angle of less than 180, which makes it pop up. While it is an earlier version (more rollers), the concept remained the same: Screenshot_20250508_205055_WhatsApp 893×1396 139 KB\n\nScreenshot_20250508_205055_WhatsApp 893×1396 139 KB\n\nScreenshot_20250508_205055_WhatsApp 893×1396 139 KB\n\nGoogle Drive file.\n\nEdit: fixed an error I had earlier",
