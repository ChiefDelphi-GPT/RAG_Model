We did one 4-bar style intake, but it was chain driven and static so that when it was impacted it didn’t fold up.\n\nI’m wondering – what’s the drive mechanism people use to allow a 4-bar style intake to fold up when hit, but still be able to verify when it’s down or up.\n\nHere’s a screen shot of Poofs in 2022. Their intake was constantly hitting walls and other robots and folding up without damage. How do you actuate something like this with motors, but allow it to fold?\n\nMy initial thought would be to spring it down, and use something like one-way bearings and chain to actuate it up. But I don’t think that’s how the better teams are doing it.",

In this specific example, I'm pretty sure 254 used pneumatics, which would have actuated the mechanism back to the deployed state even after being forced back into a collapsed state. A good example might be to look at 1678’s robot from Rapid React, which I believe used a motorized pivot. Their system seemed to have a good amount of compliance built in, so they might not have had to compensate for the driven link being back-driven.",

However, drawing out the free body diagram is more important here—understanding how much back-drive force you’ll encounter when interacting with obstacles. High-pivot 4-bar mechanisms, such as those we observed in 2022, were more prone to back-drive issues when interacting with walls due to the way forces propagated through them. Instead, consider alternative configurations, such as compliant or stretchy linkages, which would better suit protecting the intake under varying forces.",

First, if I'm actuating this thing quickly, pretty often it's broken before the feedback of \"too much current\" is back and I can make a decision. Second, I hate fixing what I think is a mechanical problem in code. Fixing this issue in code is possible, but seems wrong to me: this is primarily a mechanical problem that feels like it should be addressed with design. Pneumatics is the easy way, but most people have removed pneumatics now and it seems like an elegant motor solution would be out there somewhere. I suppose some type of friction clutch would work as well—a couple pieces of stacked polycarb tensioned together, etc. Perhaps if you sprung the intake down, and pulled up with some dyneema.",

Once properly configured and the position set, the mechanism behaves passively and complyingly without any active actions or decisions being required.",

                    "cooked": "The use of current sensing to control an actuator presents challenges. Actuators fail before receiving feedback about excessive current, necessitating mechanical failure analysis. Fixing such issues in software is error-prone.\n\nAn additional safety layer is crucial for managing intake systems. An intake mechanism should withstand impacts without collapsing. A 2024 design successfully prevented collapse despite being smashed, demonstrating resilience.\n\nHorizontal motion direction enhances intake stability. Force application varies with movement, requiring tuning for optimal resistance. Intake strength and linearity are key factors; ideal tunability ensures reliability under varying conditions.\n\nPneumatic options are less effective due to radial force distribution during operation. Motors offer better linearity, though voltage regulation remains critical. Applying consistent low voltage avoids abrupt openings, unlike sudden current limits.\n\nLastly, motor operation as a spring benefits from steady voltage, preventing rapid actuation beyond force thresholds. Consistent activation avoids mechanical stress, enhancing performance and longevity.",

On our 2022 1678 copycat intake, we made the front axis movement entirely linear, which is even better. As long as the lower axis point on the front portion of the four-bar linkage is above that arm’s rotation point, you’ll have a collapsing mechanism. Limiting current and using a pretty fast gear ratio works well. We implemented this on Whisper and it worked perfectly. One of the few intakes we built that didn’t need any maintenance to function properly.",

While effective for many applications, its reliability depends on the intake arm's weight and resistance, suggesting it isn’t universally applicable.",
