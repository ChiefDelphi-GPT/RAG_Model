                    "cooked": "Hi CD !\n\nGoing to preface this with a little explanation of why I’m writing this post, questions/TLDR at the bottom for those who don’t want to read all of this.\n\nThis year, our team struggled a LOT.\n\nWe barely managed to field a functioning drivebase before the end of our first event, and were confined to being defense only for our second(and final) event of the season. This was a huge feels-bad season, because last year we actually ended up seeding first at our second regional and went to worlds, getting picked as a backup bot for the #2 alliance.\n\nThis was mostly due to the perennial and prevalent problem of senior turnover. Our CRESCENDO season was so successful because three of our seniors that year poured more hours than what was probably healthy for them into it, with pretty much the entire rest of our team sitting on the sidelines. After losing them to the horrible fate of graduation, I was pretty much the only person to continue work during the offseason, learning how to design from scratch and gaining enough skill to be our design lead and am pretty darn proud of how far I’ve gotten with it. I’ll probably make a separate topic about the organizational issues we’ve faced, but I have a feeling a little digging will bring up some threads that describe very similar situations. However, our biggest issue by far this year was that our fabrication team was completely inexperienced(genuinely rookie-tier) and nobody(including me) correctly estimated how much time we’d need to spend on the build, leading to an EXTREMELY rushed robot and not delivering on any of the design capabilities this year.\n\nWith all that being said, what have teams done to improve the speed and quality of their builds? I’m looking to get a bunch of training in this offseason to help make up the experience gap, but I’m sure there are teams on CD that have been in similar positions that they found out how to dig themselves out of. Our machine shop could use some new equipment, our students could do with a little more learning, and I’ve seen time and time again that the best way to get better at building robots is to build more robots.\n\nLooking for tips, advice, or long writeups if I’m very lucky and people are very kind . How have teams been able to improve their build quality outside of design through machining practices and training programs? Is there any must-have equipment that I might not know about? How do teams create and enforce build schedules(examples would also help!)? I have a feeling that this problem is going to require the creation of a lot of base processes and a little bit of the nitty gritty stuff(new machines and equipment), so any implementations of those would be great to hear too!\n\nTLDR:\n\nBad season for my team. How can we improve our build speed and quality? How does YOUR team approach planning build season and training fabrication students? What operations should a regional-competitive team be able to do in house, and to what level of precision? Any tips or tricks that might help a rising team captain to dig their team out of this hole?\n\nAs always, I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this, and double thanks to anyone who responds\n\nWe have :\n\nA battery of 3D printers\n\n2 cordless drills and a whole bunch of drill bits(although both are very old and many bits are blunted)\n\nPretty much any wiring equipment that a team would commonly have\n\nCommon hand tools(hammers, screwdrivers, hex drivers, etc.)\n\nA very old CNC router(can find out what model the next time I’m in the shop)\n\nA chop saw\n\nA drill press\n\nA bench grinder\n\nA laser cutter\n\nI want:\n\nNew drills and bits\n\nA battery powered rivet gun\n\nA hydraulic crimper for our battery wires\n\nAn arbor press",

Several things have changed since then but the overall concept is the same.\n\nOur design decisions mostly happened on an open chat between current design members and alumni. I solo designed our robot this year, and I could definitely feel my inexperience in some places. We overscoped for sure and that’s on me, but we have a habit of designing more robot than we should and our alumni didn’t really stop me😅. The reason I focus on build quality and speed rather than this is because I know enough now to limit scope for next year, and we still weren’t able to deliver on what a team reasonably should be able to in the span of a season fabrication-wise.\n\nOur swerve didn’t majorly change this year. We used Tuner X to generate swerve, our main issues came in wiring because nobody really knew how to wire well until about week 3 of the season(this sounds much worse than I thought it would when writing this)\n\nMost everything in the build was COTS if it could be, nothing that I designed wasn’t easily manufacturable with our resources. We experienced more issues with assembly and tolerances on parts that needed to be cut to length.\n\nAs I mentioned above, I solo designed this year. I had two alumni to help me out with design decisions and I posted my design to DDS for a design review which helped quite a bit. Nobody else on our team currently knows how to design.\n\nWe started immediately on the drivebase, which was finished by the end of week 1. From there, we waited for the design to be done, which took another week and a half(not sure if this is something we need to speed up or do concurrently). Our real issue came after when I made a spreadsheet of all the manufacturing tasks we needed done after design was finished, and got sick. I couldn’t go to meetings for a week and was expecting some progress but things hadn’t started at all. I also severely underestimated the time it would take to assemble the robot, relying on our official meetings for another week until I realized how behind we were. Not many people on our team were very involved, maybe 1 or 2 along with me intermittently, but we ended up making enough progress to have our elevator built and mounted by end of February(when I had expected the robot to be done and ready for software). I started coming in every day and assembling for as long as I could, but even with that I couldn’t finish our subsystems and mount all of them before our first competition.\n\nHope this answers your questions.",

They built a RI3D bot with no vision and simple sensors. They were an alliance captain at one event, Event finalist Captain at the next, and finished comfortably middle at the Michigan States. They focused on doing simple things well and reliably.\n\nIn comparison our “lead” robot team spent a ton of time on complex systems that never worked (4 camera vision) as well as not doing the simple things competently. It wasn’t a bad robot but the team bit off way more than they could chew and accrued a huge technical debt that they didn’t have the time to deal with.\n\nOur team goal is to be a solid alliance partner. Michigan is too tough of a neighborhood to try and beat the likes of Rush or Stryke Force, but we can really make an awesome partner.\n\nOur thoughts for next year is deal with technical debt in the off season and don’t make major changes during the on-season.",

Was it mechanical, programming, something else? The other posts don’t emphasize this, but test early and often (though not too often). We we’re testing our swerve around February 7-8, which was good because there were code changes by REV and we had an encoder angle off by 180 degrees. Unfortunately we didn’t get to testing pathplanner changes until much closer to the competition, but that still went okay.\n\nOn the flip side, we had an FTC season where I remember doing too many practice events that we didn’t really have time to properly build anything and kept taking some things off to be better for the practice, so you do need enough time to build and program and test things.\n\nOn the manufacturing side, we are aggressively COTS because our tooling is basically just band saw, drill press, jigsaw, hand drill, and we meet in the home ec room. This also means that there isn’t much barrier to making things as long as they aren’t custom and just involve cutting things.",

Instead of trying to do everything we tried to determine what top teams would do, and then be the best compliment for that.\n\nIf the goal is simply success on the field its better to start small and build from there. Analyzing this years game you could assume 6-8 of L4 coral would be covered by top teams in auto, leaving only 4-6 more cycles. Do you think any top team would not be able to handle that? We found in our scouting a lot of teams that would be much faster to play L2/3 but spend a lot of the match getting half as many L4 cycles.\n\nIt’s hard to look at the game and not want to do everything, but hopefully evaluating your resources and designing for those will help next season. We knew going into this season we had a pretty limited cad crew and green manufacturing team. We chose to use Eliot’s belt in tube elevator as inspiration, and off the shelf bearing blocks to get us started. This let us get our elevator together relatively quickly, and then fix/replace things as necessary.\n\nWe also use week 0 as our goal. That requires a robot to be mostly manufactured and assembled in about 4-5 weeks. This year we were a little behind that and rebuilt after week 0, but had planned for it ahead of time.",
