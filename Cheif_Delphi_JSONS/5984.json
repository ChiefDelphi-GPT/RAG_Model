From drivers to state-of-the-art algorithms, and with powerful developer tools, ROS has what you need for your next robotics project. And it’s all open source.” This is a pretty apt description because it doesn’t fall into the trap of describing what the core ROS code is. Because, at its core, ROS is a messaging framework for distributed applications. However, ROS ’s libraries, tools, and open-source nature make it unique.\n\nNote: When I say ROS , I am specifically referring to ROS2 (I am currently using ROS2 Jazzy)\n\nMotivation\n\nSeeing teams such as CyberKnights (195) and Zebracorns (900) successfully implement ROS on their competition robots inspired me to see what was possible with the open nature of the FRC control system. Teams continually struggle with the tight build, program, and test cycle in FRC . In an FRC season, you have barely six weeks to go from an idea of what the robot needs to accomplish to a fully functional, programmed, and tested robot. This is especially hard considering most teams don’t even have a built robot until near the end of these six weeks. I propose using ROS to lighten teams’ software load during the season.\n\nTeams have continually tried to improve their simulation capabilities and implement newer and more advanced controls such as state space and linear quadratic regulators that Tyler Veness has added into WPILib and detailed in his awesome book (seriously it is amazing, if you are at all interested in control theory I highly recommend giving it a read here ). But, over my time in FRC I have come to the opinion that teams dont need more advanced control algorithms or more complex simulations, they need tested and working control code. This means writing as little control code as possible which is slightly at odds with the current FRC paradigm where teams write their own robot code and sparingly use vendor dependencies for hardware interaction and path planning. This results in teams continually reimplementing the same exact code to control the realitvely few mechanisms that every team in FRC decides to deploy on their robot.\n\nThis is where I propose ROS comes into play, by leveraging the composable node architecture of ROS we can reuse code from previous robots simply by running an already written node, or we can use part of another teams code simply by pulling and running their nodes. Since all ROS nodes need to communicate through a distributed pub/sub architecture that automatically handles message serialization and message type code generation we can write generic interfaces between different parts of our robot control such that they can easily be swapped out for a different implementation or removed entirely.\n\nDifferences from previous implementations:\n\nLooking at how teams have implemented ROS in the past there a few things that I would like to do differently in my approach:\n\nSimulation: Utilizing Gazebo to do full physics based robot simulation will allow many teams to program and validate their full control system including vision and sensing without a physical robot or field.\n\nSimulation: Utilizing Gazebo to do full physics based robot simulation will allow many teams to program and validate their full control system including vision and sensing without a physical robot or field.\n\nLeveraging Open Soure: A major benefit of ROS is the massive breadth of open source nodes and packages such as ROS2_control, ROS2_controllers, MoveIt2, and Nav2. Utilizing these as much as possible will reduce the amount of reimplementation needed for every robot,\n\nLeveraging Open Soure: A major benefit of ROS is the massive breadth of open source nodes and packages such as ROS2_control, ROS2_controllers, MoveIt2, and Nav2. Utilizing these as much as possible will reduce the amount of reimplementation needed for every robot,\n\nUse ROS2_Control: Many of the previous implementations do not use ROS2_Control. I think this is a downside to some of the previous implementations, ROS2_Control allows for hard realtime control loops in ROS while not requiring you to write new controllers or hardware interfaces for each mechanism. By creating a set of hardware interfaces working with ROS2 Control for all the major FRC motors we can allow controlling motors from the ROS network directly through a CAN connection for the coprocessor or over a network connection between the coprocessor and the RoboRIO,\n\nUse ROS2_Control: Many of the previous implementations do not use ROS2_Control.

By developing reusable ROS nodes that conform to the ROS standards, we would all be able to have a much greater impact on the community as a whole.\n\nContributing to the Open Source Robotics Community: Many of the geometry and control algorithms integrated into WPILib that we all take for granted are much more advanced than what other robotics competitions and hobbyists have access to. By developing reusable ROS nodes that conform to the ROS standards, we would all be able to have a much greater impact on the community as a whole.\n\nCurrent Implementation Plans:\n\nCurrently, I plan on implementing a set of hardware interfaces to communicate with the motor controllers that my team uses (Talon FX, Talon SRX, Spark Max) and the sensors we commonly use (CANCoder, Pigeon IMU, BeamBreaks). I also plan on implementing a Swerve Drive Controller, After that I plan on experimenting with using behavior trees as an alternative to command based architecture.\n\nCurrent Progress:\n\nI have started writing a Talon SRX hardware interface that talks to the RoboRIO over the network utilizing ZMQ and ProtoBuf (very heavily inspired by CyberKnights)\n\nI have also started working on a simulated SwerveDrive to test the controller, kinematics, and odometry.\n\nGoals and Timeline:\n\nGoals for this project include:\n\nBeing able to write a full FRC robot in ROS before the 2025 season.\n\nBeing able to write a full FRC robot in ROS before the 2025 season.\n\nRunning a ROS robot at Roboticon and Pirates Pillage offseason events\n\nRunning a ROS robot at Roboticon and Pirates Pillage offseason events\n\nCreating a written and video tutorial series to bring the power of ROS to other teams in FRC and create better documentation for the open source robotics community in general\n\nCreating a written and video tutorial series to bring the power of ROS to other teams in FRC and create better documentation for the open source robotics community in general\n\nHow to get involved:\n\nThis is a massive undertaking for one person so i would love some help. If you have a strong passion for robotics and programming I would love to talk to you. The best ways to contact me are this Chief Delphi thread for more general questions or comments, or my teams discord server. The link for the discord server is below and my name in the server is Henry. Please don’t hesitate to reach out or just join to hang with the awesome community we have in there.\n\nMy current plan is to make a post on CD about once a week detailing my current progress and starting to create tutorials for how you can get started on programming your own robots in ROS .\n\nCheck out the Ninjineers 2383 (Unofficial) community on Discord - hang out with 119 other members and enjoy free voice and text chat.\n\nNote #2: Tyler Veness ( @calcmogul ) I would love to chat with you about the WPILib lie theory implementation of Swerve Drive Odometry.",

However, I took a slightly different approach and used network tables as a bridge between a linux coprocessor and the Roborio.  The linux computer runs the ROS stack, while the roborio continues to function as the interface with the FMS and vendor harware.  So far, i have reached a point where i have a ROS2 controller for a differential drivetrain with full ROS2 mapping and localization capabilities using a RP -Lidar (ncluding, sim capabilities).\n\nIt has been a few months since i worked on it, and i am traveling right now, but I will dust it off and try to post a link here when i get home.",

Now I understand that it will always be harder than getting started with WPILib just due to the fact that you need to develop a distributed system and currently you need to handle all the deployment yourself. Handling cross-platform development in ROS is also pretty difficult as they have very little macOS support and the windows support is a little sketchy. I am currently using WSL2 to do all my development in windows and managed to get GPU acceleration working so it is very smooth. The first tutorial I make is going to cover getting your development environment set up in Windows and Linux.\n\nWindows is also the only supported driver station client currently, but I do know people who do all their FRC development on macs because their driver station is not an ideal development computer",

Currently, an FRC programmer laptop can be set up with one non-admin installer (if you install for the current user only). Imo, you should strive for that level of ease-of-installation as well.\n\nThe instructions on Installing ROS 2 on Windows — ROS 2 Documentation: Crystal documentation don’t sound too bad. Pretty much all the dependencies could be bundled instead of using chocolatey (which managed school machines can’t use anyway). Visual Studio would have to be installed separately like C++ teams do already for simulation. Making it required for Java teams to deploy any code would be new.\n\nWSL2 is a non-starter imo. My FRC students used to use it, but it took way longer to set up than just using the WPILib installer and provided VS Code install. It also isn’t available to students using school laptops (not enabled by default, and no admin permissions to enable it).",

The idea of contributing from FRC to the open source robotics community is also strongly appealing.\n\nHowever, as a mentor I would be a little worried about the impact fully embracing ROS2 would have on new and low, or even medium, resource teams. The resource barrier to teams, especially new teams, is consistently rising. I think there is a place for ROS2 in FRC but I’d be worried about it raising the performance ceiling for high resource teams and raising the already high barrier to entry new and low resource teams.\n\nOn the other hand, robotics and the engineering fields will always be changing and the technology we use in FRC should reflect those changes.",
