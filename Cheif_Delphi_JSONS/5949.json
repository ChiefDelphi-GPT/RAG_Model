Fortunately, we had spares to swap in so that we could still play, but we would be out for a match if the module broke in between our systems check and our match.\n\nWe use MAXSwerve from REV, and it was our first year on swerve. Our team is considering switching modules, but first we are trying to figure out if it was a team problem and we weren’t taking care of them right, or if its a problem with MAXSwerve.\n\nAnyone who could share what type of modules you have and how often they broke or give us any recommendations for keeping ours running would be greatly appreciated.",

Also we only had to replace our swerve treads once and we went to three competitions and mix that in with preseason practice and season practice they held up great. We used two regular neos for drive and steering. And the absolute encoder that comes with it from Andy mark. Also make sure to put amp limits on the motor controllers! Also, my Theory for assembling them is there is never too much lock tite to hold it together.",

Easily solved by removing the offending debris and putting a polycarb shield over the top plates.  Otherwise, no mechanical issues (the wheels even survived some falls from the chain, just some small chips taken out of them but still more than functional)",

Our team has used Swerve X modules ( WCP ) for the last three seasons and never had a mechanical problem. We bashed up a couple of motors on our first set (we kept whacking them into the high bar during the climb until we added guards) and had an electrical problem in a module last season (our fault), but that’s pretty much it. We used them all pretty heavily too, especially the Rapid React set that took several crashes from the traverse bar without a hitch.",

We swapped ratios before worlds last year, so that gearing is newish.\n\n(Lots of practice on a half field and some off seasons on these modues as well)",

Don’t believe we’ve had a single mechanical failure.\n\nOnly thing we’ve done for maintenance is a complete teardown and reassemblely at the start of build season of our modules. I will admit it takes some extra care to assemble the modules properly (not over tightening bolts is a big one), and be very attentive to anything that doesnt feel/seem quite right. If its not buttery smooth when turning the wheel or module, its time to inspect, likely disassemble, and reassemble.\n\nThe only “failures” we’ve had running these modules have been from poor crimps and improperly seated connectors (user error), and fortunately never in a match thanks to some very mindful students and their pre-match inspections (knock on wood…).\n\n@Connour has typically overseen the assembly of our modules by students in the past, and the biggest words of wisdom I’ve heard him share repeatedly, is to read the manual thoroughly. Both before assembly, and during assembly.",

Wheel tread replacement is just part of the usual wear and tear.\n\nThe gears in the Max Swerve did not hold up as well as I’d like for a full season, but they would make it through a full competition no problem. The Encoders were the weak point for us. We broke plastic housings on the Hex through bore encoders and that essentially makes it useless. Those are relatively cheap, but can be hard to come by in stock sometimes so get em while you can and bring spares.\n\nIf we could find a more robust encoder I’d switch.",

The laundry list of things to check for, including making sure not to overtighten the Ultraplanetary stages and loctiting those bolts is true.  Also hot glue on all the connectors for the REV Throughbore encoders.  We’ve also had a module or two assembled wrong with the main pinion installed backwards, but if you are careful you should avoid that.  We’ve made sure to lubricate the gears and keep junk out with a cover.  The firmware update for the Flex controllers helped along with securing all the CAN connections for some issues.  Wheels have been lately are biggest inconvenience just trying to get a system that works for us, but overall it has been more pleasant than I even expected giving the challenges of swerve and how little maintenance was required on many pre-swerve drivetrains.",

                    "cooked": "My kids actually practiced swapping motors (I am so sick of NEOs…) and swerve modules.  NASCAR pit style! At the Texas state champs we were the third pick and had a swerve issue going into the finals.  Our team mates were just gobsmacked to see our pit crew pull a module and swap in a module in under 10 minutes.\n\nBefore that they were thinking “OMG, we are doomed”…\n\nI’d say we have to do something significant on a swerve (motor, loctite fail, or something that needs detailed diagnosis) maybe twice a competition? SDS MK4.  We’ve run L3 and L4.\n\nLoctite, loctite, loctite\n\nOh, and make TWO crazy wheels.  Its an “in the queue” type swap and that dead module just costs you 25% of your tractive effort, rather than the match.  We loaned two crazy wheels to a team at the Robot Remix, and gave one to another team early in the season.  All three ended up boogered, but saved their bacon!  BTW, this is typical damage seen on all three.  No real clue how this happens on a totally flat field!  Maybe running the little rubber rollers at 5 million RPM causes enough drag to bend the Aluminum…  Wait, that’s actually 5,000 RPM at 17 feet per second.  OK, there’s your answer!  Hmmmm…  Teflon rollers???",

As long as the tread is cut right and installed correctly and everything is loctited and the gears are lubricated you should have no problems. We did have one issue with the v1 falcon cooling screw coming off into the inside of the motor and seizing the outrunner to the outer case, we fixed that by removing the plugs and taping over them.",
