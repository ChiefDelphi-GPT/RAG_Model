                    "cooked": "YAGSL is a Generic Swerve Library that aims to simplify the process of creating a comprehensive and complete SwerveDrive with best practices from MANY SwerveDrive examples. YAGSL supports pretty much every swerve drive configuration possible and if there is an issue we will address it as soon as possible and credit discoveries.\n\nYAGSL is designed so you can just copy over your code onto a robot then configure the JSON files and your program will just work. If you develop multiple robots this could be a major benefit because your competition robot and practice robot can have the same codebase without changing anything.\n\nWe are thrilled to announce the latest and greatest update to YAGSL — version 2025.0.0 ! With this release, we’ve added some groundbreaking features and improvements, making YAGSL an even more powerful tool for controlling swerve drives and integrating with robotics simulations. Below, we’ll walk you through the most exciting new changes and enhancements!\n\nA quick overview of YAGSL features are:\n\nUses motor controller PID exclusively.\n\nData for each swerve module.\n\nCompatible with Advantage Scope swerve widget.\n\nCompatible with FRC Web Components.\n\nSupport for TalonFX, SparkFlex, and SparkMax without changing any of the code base.\n\nAn actual library as opposed to template code.\n\nDocumentation , yes even javadocs .\n\nMost absolute encoders (even discontinued ones!) are supported!\n\nDoes not require a CommandBased project and could be implemented in a TimedRobot.\n\nAdvanced tuning for motor controller output limits and supply amps.\n\nSimulation support.\n\nAn easy configuration webpage!\n\nPathPlanner implemented.\n\nPhotonVision support.\n\nMapleSim Integration: Revolutionizing the Simulation\n\n254’s SwerveSetpoint Generator\n\nPathPlanner Feedforward Integration\n\nNew AdvantageScope NetworkTable Keys\n\nConfiguration JSON Gear Ratios\n\nTalonSRX Encoders by @WispySparks\n\nOdometry and Simulation Color Updates\n\nMAXSwerve Absolute Encoder Offsets fix.\n\nNavX inverted offset fix.\n\nimage 1906×1024 72 KB\n\nimage 1906×1024 72 KB\n\nimage 1906×1024 72 KB\n\nimage 1260×705 37.7 KB\n\nimage 1260×705 37.7 KB\n\nimage 1260×705 37.7 KB\n\nimage 1095×643 57 KB\n\nimage 1095×643 57 KB\n\nimage 1095×643 57 KB\n\nimage 989×504 115 KB\n\nimage 989×504 115 KB\n\nimage 989×504 115 KB\n\nAll of these amazing features come right out of the box! You do not need some super complicated setup to take advantage of everything shown here! We exist to try to raise the floor of swerve drives and drivebases overall for FRC .\n\nThe 2025 release of YAGSL comes packed with exciting updates, ranging from new integrations with simulation tools like MapleSim to improved functionality and support for new hardware components. This update takes swerve drive control to a new level, making it easier and more efficient for teams to implement advanced swerve drive features while simultaneously enhancing their simulation capabilities.\n\nHere are the major changes introduced in this release:\n\nOne of the most significant additions in YAGSL 2025.0.0 is the integration with MapleSim — a powerful physics simulator designed to model and simulate mechanical systems in great detail. With this integration, you can now accurately model your swerve drive’s dynamics and performance using MapleSim , providing a better simulation experience and more accurate results.\n\nThis addition helps teams fine-tune their swerve drives without the need for physical hardware testing, which is particularly useful for iterative design processes. Many thanks to @catr1xLiu for making this integration a reality!\n\nWe’ve also included an implementation of 254’s SwerveSetpoint Generator , a tool that allows you to generate swerve drive setpoints based on your robot’s desired position and orientation. This setpoint generator is incredibly useful for automating trajectory-following and is a core tool for teams looking to optimize their robot’s autonomous capabilities. It simplifies the process of generating swerve drive commands and reduces the likelihood of errors when programming autonomous routines.\n\nThanks to @catr1xLiu , we’ve added support for PathPlanner’s Feedforward model, which uses DCMotor modeling to predict the feedforward values required for accurate swerve drive movement along a path. This makes it easier to implement smooth, consistent motion control and trajectory following, reducing the risk of overshoot and other errors.\n\nThis update helps teams implement PathPlanner with confidence, knowing that they are getting the most out of their swerve drive system.\n\nWe’ve added a fun and functional visual update to the simulation! In the default simulation , the odometry reading is now shown in pink and yellow , while the simulation reading is displayed in red and green . This update makes it easier to distinguish between real-time odometry and the simulated data, improving clarity during testing and debugging. image 736×360 56.6 KB\n\nimage 736×360 56.6 KB\n\nimage 736×360 56.6 KB\n\nAdvantageScope keys are now available under swerve/advantageScope\n\nTalonSRX Encoders by @Wispy\n\nUpgraded to the new REVLib configuration classes.\n\nRedux Robotics CanAndGyro Support\n\nStarting pose definition capabilities are now in the Example!\n\nA configuration application like Tuner X Swerve Generator is coming soon!\n\nEasy installation without required dependency troubles.\n\nGear ratios and wheel diameters must now be defined and the old method of conversion factors is no longer valid. Please refer to Standard Conversion Factors for the updated conversion factor formats.\n\nExample from physicalproperties.json :\n\nto\n\nThis change allows us to support maple-sim to its fullest capabilities as well as calculate the DriveFeedforwards for SparkMax controlled motors (note: You should define the motor model if you are going to use the Feedfowards from PathPlanner if its atypical for the motor controller!)\n\nWe’d like to give a huge shout-out to the following contributors who made this release possible:\n\n@Etaash-mathamsetty for their work on supporting kA and the feedforward system.\n\n@WispySparks for adding support for TalonSRX encoders.\n\n@catr1xLiu for integrating MapleSim , PathPlanner Feedforward , and DCMotor modeling .\n\nAnd, of course, thanks to all of our dedicated contributors and users who continue to make YAGSL better with every release!\n\nTo help you get the most out of YAGSL 2025.0.0, here are some valuable resources:\n\nYAGSL Documentation\n\nYAGSL Example Repository\n\nYAGSL Library Docs\n\nhttps://broncbotz3481.github.io/YAGSL-Lib/yagsl/yagsl.json\n\nWe hope you’re as excited about this release as we are! Happy swerve driving, and happy coding!\n\nIf you’ve found YAGSL helpful and want to support the project, consider buying us a coffee!
