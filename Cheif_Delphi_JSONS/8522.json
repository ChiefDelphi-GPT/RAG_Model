                    "cooked": "We have been using navx through rio MXP for a couple seasons now and have run into this new issue this season where it would spam disconnecting / reconnecting / reset detected. This happens randomly (every 10 ish seconds) only when we are enabled . I am confident it is not a power issue because although the bot is enabled, we aren’t really driving it at the moment, and it happens when the bot is enabled but completely idle as well. I see that there are similar issues already on CD, but are all related to browning out which we aren’t having. There are also no wires run over the navx so I dont think EMI is an issue.\n\nSpecifics\n\nRio2 is newly imaged for 2023\n\nusing 2023 WPI - KauaiLabs_navX_FRC 2023.0.3\n\nconnected via MXP expansion port on rio\n\nCPU utilization is not high\n\nWhen initializing the navX to use SPI (protocol we used last year with no issue),  it would spam disconnecting / reconnecting / reset detected randomly every 10 ish seconds.\n\nWhen initializing the navX to use I2C, console messages go in the order of:\n\nnavx disconnected\n\nnavx reconnected\n\n*and then robot comms die (super weird but this happens consistently)\n\nThis is mostly just a drivebase at the moment and the rio just has power, ethernet (via rev RPM), an empty canbus loop that is terminated to the REV PDH, USB to canivore with a non empty can loop, and of course the navx2 connected via MXP port on rio2 - properly screwed in.\n\nThis was tried with 2 navX2’s. One was brand new, the other was from our 2022 bot which had none of these issues.\n\nI checked the physical pins and they all seem unobstructed. I also shook the robot and carefully tried to wiggle the navx while enabled and found that the disconnections were not related to these physical disturbances.\n\nThe root of the issue might be either electrical, firmware, or somehow software? (is there any way code could cause this??) . However, electrical seems fine as it is just the MXP port and we aren’t browning at all or anything and firmware is all 2023… So, I am kinda stuck on this issue.\n\nAny help, questions, ideas, critiques would be greatly appreciated in solving this problem.\n\nThanks in advance!",

I agree with @Programming4907 that you should add the firmware level to your spreadsheet to document that important check.\n\nAt some point soon you have to decide if finding blame and then resolution can be completed before your first competition. Speculating what has happened is interesting to a point but then you have to move on.\n\nMy team discovered the day before our first competition last season that the NavX micro on USB didn’t play nice with CANivore on USB (couldn’t risk the I2C ports). We ran away from the NavX and used team family and friends for a Pony Express to CTRE to procure a Pigeon 2. We had no time and no choice and ended up loving our Pigeon that only took a few minutes to change the code to work.",
