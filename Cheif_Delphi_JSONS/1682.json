                    "cooked": "Hi. We are trying to improve our pose estimation so we can do better autos. We have two cameras connected to a Pi and they work great. When there is an April tag visible, the pose is very accurate. However, during those periods when no April tag is visible, we have to rely on odometry and it’s not very accurate. We checked all our constants and debugged the data we get from encoders, all of that looks correct. My guess is the problem has to do with friction and slippage of the wheels. The faster we go, the higher the error. The swerve pose estimator assumes that the number of wheel rotations translates to distance traveled, which is not really the case. Before we try to invent a “creative” way to correct for this, I wanted to check if there is any standard way to handle this or if anyone has any other ideas?",

                    "cooked": "A few thoughts from my team’s experience with debugging pose estimation:\n\nThe easiest and most obvious first step is to ensure that if you drive forward slowly some distance, the robot actually registers that distance. This discounts any error in constants, such as gear ratio + wheel circumference. If the constants are incorrect, you will see your position error increase linearly with the distance traveled (e.g., drive 1 meter, the robot thinks it has gone 1.1 meters; drive 2 meters, the robot thinks it has gone 2.2 meters). Keep in mind that your wheel circumference isn’t actually the circumference of your wheel; it’s the WORKING wheel circumference. We found it’s best to calibrate this number (move the robot some distance, see what distance we traveled, see what difference we should have traveled, add a fudge factor). Keep in mind that the fudge factor should only be used if your error is increasing linearly with distance driven. Another approach to getting this “fudge factor” is to rotate the robot in a circle using the gyro, compare how far each module should have gone vs how far they actually went. There’s a pretty good post by 6328 on this website somewhere.\n\nAnother common reason that odometry data may be very wrong could be wheel slippage, which happens when you request accelerations outside your robot’s limits. There isn’t really a way to account for this solely in odometry; you should really stop the robot from skidding in the first place. Some potential ways to do this could include:\n\nslew rate limiters on x, y, omega\n\ncustom acceleration limiting stuff\n\nswerve setpoint generator with pathplanner, Swerve Setpoint Generator | PathPlanner Docs Also, you should set good stator current limits on your motors in addition to one of the solutions above. Here are relevant CTRE docs: Swerve Setpoint Generator | PathPlanner Docs All of the above is dedicated to avoiding wheel slip, but it doesn’t account for what happens if your wheels actually do slip (your odometry will get messed up). If you really want to account for wheel slip in your odometry, check out the relevant portion of Orbit 1690’s software lecture: https://youtu.be/N6ogT5DjGOk?t=1681 . Imo it’s pretty hard to use skid detection with the WPILib SwerveDrivePoseEstimator, so I wouldn’t rlly recommend it (assuming thats what you are using. All in all, you should still get good results without.\n\nOne more thing you could try, although you shouldn’t really NEED this for accurate odometry, is higher frequency odometry. From my team’s experience, if your odometry is alr inaccurate, this isn’t going to fix anything, but it does make pure odometry more reliable. CTRE docs: Factors that Impact Odometry I think 6328 also did some testing with this at some point and made a pretty nice post, but I couldn’t find it anywhere.\n\nFollow-up question: How inaccurate is your odometry really? How are you measuring it? Some amount of inaccuracy in your odometry is to be expected, that’s why we have vision; it really depends on how much and over how long.\n\nHope this helps!",

You would need to make your own pods with FRC -scale omni wheels, but a basic swingarm design is very easy to make (its just an omni wheel with an encoder that sits on a arm that pivots).",

Yesterday I ran about a dozen tests with constant speeds (10%, 15% and 40% of max speed) and measured actual distance traveled with tape measure. It looks like pose estimation is off by 5%-10% in either direction (sometimes overestimates, sometimes underestimates). I would actually be ok with that kind of error, but I’m pretty sure it’s worse when we accelerate and turn. I will try to measure error in those scenarios next.\n\nBased on these results though, it doesn’t seem to me that constants are the issue.. I would expect it to be consistently over or under if constants were off.",

I would expect it to be consistently over or under if constants were off.\n\nI agree and think you need to dig deeper on the wheel-odo-only measurements. I would expect you could easily get slow speed straight-line errors down under 2% (2.5 inches over 10 feet). (We didn’t carefully measure our repeatability, but it was good enough that we moved on and there’s no way we’d move on if it was 5-10% off.)\n\nCover up/disable all the cameras. Use straight wheel odometry only. Cap speed at 10% of max and motor power to 25% or so. Line the wheels up ahead of time. Move 10 feet, measure it, tweak, repeat until you get that down in the 0-2% range.\n\nIf those measures are off by 5+%, I think you need to work with mechanical and/or a mentor to figure that out or you’re building your house on top of a foundation of marshmallow.\n\n(That doesn’t mean you need to halt all other work until you sort this out, but I think you should get it sorted out fairly soon from a start-with-the-basics approach.)",

Those sound kind of terrible…  Real motivation for this thread!!!\n\nYour starting point needs to be slow speed with slow ramp up/down and tape measured distances.  There’s no sense in checking faster until you have slow -nailed-.  As long a span as you can reasonably work with!  One wheel rotation is only a foot-ish; you need a bunch of rotations to make the error in the tape measure a minor factor. Note the comment about aligning the wheels before you start!\n\nAnother item:  This may sound silly, but I suggest you put a tape or marker mark on each wheel.  Lift the robot (power is off) and clock all four wheels with the mark down.  THEN do a short test; maybe 4 feet or so.  See if the marks are all still clocked the same way.  You might have a wacky problem where one or two wheels are fighting the others!\n\nWatching/videoing the wheels during this escapade is worth bonus points\n\nAnother exotic problem is the logic around dealing with steering 0 and 180 vs wheel forward/reverse.  You MIGHT have something going on with this switch in the code.",
