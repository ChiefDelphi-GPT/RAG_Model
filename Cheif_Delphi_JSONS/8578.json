I looked in the game manual and couldnt find anything that particularly says this. We are looking to add polycarb around our robot frame to deflect notes, and the easiest way would be to screw polycarb directly to our bumper wood. Is this legal? Thanks",

R408F is possible, but even less likely.  In either case (or any I’ve missed), if it is outside the frame perimeter in STARTING CONFIGURATION, it has to somehow be justified as part of the tightly regulated BUMPERS.  I wouldn’t count on it, for sure.  As an RI , I wouldn’t accept either argument without consulting the LRI .  Do you feel lucky?\n\nAn alternate route to what you want:  Make this skid plate part of the robot.  It has to start inside the frame perimeter, but there are no rules preventing it from popping under the bumper at the beginning of the match and just staying there, and fouls from such a device seem unlikely.  In 2017 STEAMworks, my team (3946) used a player station intake ramp that extended from inside the frame perimeter to the “bumper perimeter” powered by a pair of spring hinges.  Depending on your bumper height and how far out the skid plate extends, this might be just as simple or really complicated.\n\nAnd OBTW, while not nearly as robust, corrugated plastic (CP) is lighter and more slippery than polycarbonate.  We prototyped the ramp in CP, and built in polycarbonate.  We switched back for competition for the slippery feature.",
