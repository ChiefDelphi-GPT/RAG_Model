You have a REV Through Bore encoder, wired using the WHITE wire, so it’s an absolute encoder. You want to set soft limits near your hard stops (where the arm is physically unable to move), and you want to use position or Motion Magic control to move the arm to a position. You have a TalonFX motor controller (Falcon 500, Kraken, or FXS) to move the arm.\n\nWith this setup, you would:\n\nconfigure the CANdi’s AbsoluteSensorDiscontinuityPoint to be in the center of your hard stops.\n\nDO NOT enable ClosedLoopGeneral.ContinuousWrap in the motor controller’s config.\n\nset the offset so the arm straight out is zero.\n\nset the sensor and motor controller inverts so upward from zero is positive.\n\noptionally, but highly recommended, configure the kG feedforward gain and configure GravityType to Arm_Cosine\n\nassuming you’re using remote sensor type (you don’t have Phoenix Pro), use the withLimitForwardMotion and withLimitReverseMotion feature of the motor controller’s control request to enforce soft limits, just in case.\n\nWith this setup, the position will stay within one rotation in the range defined by the discontinuity point, so you can command it to go to a location.\n\nNOTE: If the arm is capable of moving 360-degrees (has no hard stop limiting it from going more than one rotation), but it cannot without severing wires, there is no 100% safe way to avoid this programmatically. You can control what the program does, but you can’t control what happens when the robot is off or disabled, and you only get absolute position within one rotation. There’s no programmatic way to know if the arm was rotated over 360-degrees when the robot was powered off.",

As an example, if those give values of 0.7 and -0.2 (which is the same as 0.8), then your discontinuity point would be around 0.75 rot.\n\nIf those give practically the same position, then consider which position is more likely to be your boot position. If the -0.2 case is more likely, for example, maybe you move the discontinuity point down a bit to 0.7 rot. On the other hand, if the 0.7 rot case is mroe likely, then maybe move it up a bit to 0.8 rot.",

We’re using a fused CANdi with a REV through bore sensor without problems, but our offset and range is a bit different from yours. You can compare to our configuration if you like.\n\nIf the issue is indeed that the offset + initial position is adding up to over 1 and fused/sync feedback doesn’t mitigate it for you, there may be a couple of options.\n\nYou could try reseting the motor position to an equivalent value within the [0-1) range. That’s where modulus could be of use. motor.setPosition(currentPosition % 1) . I’d recommend doing this in a way that it won’t be requested every loop, such as only if the position is outside the [0-1) range.\n\nYou could send position requests in the [1 - 2) range when your sensor value is in that range. Integer division of the position signal is your friend here. I.E. output = demand + (int)currentPosition . Limits on your motor position would need to be adjusted to account for this, making it overall less safe.\n\nReseat your sensor so that your offset can’t result in this case.\n\nOf course, this logic would need to change a bit if your discontinuity point were any value other than 1.\n\nI definitely wouldn’t recommend continuous mode since that would always try to take the smallest turn between any two angles. It’s more meant for applications such as swerve azimuth.\n\nJust to confirm, is your discontinuity point 1 because your expected range of motion is something like 0.1 - 0.9? You want the discontinuity point to be outside the range of motion.",
