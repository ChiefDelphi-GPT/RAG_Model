As we didn’t want to risk getting a logging framework up and running (they were tight on RAM too on the RoboRio 1). Eventually found a problem Neo 1.1 that was drawing far to much current. (Motor swap fixed their issue.)\n\nWhat would have been about 90s to identify from “hello” became almost 30 minutes as we looked to try to find ways to get the data to guide our next steps. They nearly missed their next match.\n\nIf you think you really need some feature the PDH 2.0 has, make sure you set time aside with your programming team to ensure you capture that information you’re going to miss out on. Maybe you won’t need it… maybe you will. Just don’t forget Murphy’s Law.",

Power distribution always seems to end up in a tight location where it’s hard enough to get wires in, much less have the clearance to swing the tool around above the entire unit.  With the number of times we reconfigured circuits last year, having easy to use lever terminals on the PDH was something we appreciated a lot.\n\nI also sympathize with CSAs on the loss of “Level 1” built-in logging.  I’m all for reducing cost of components, but this seems like a lot of lost utility for a small cost savings.\n\nIn our experience, getting 4AWG into the PDH main terminals is definitely possible, just requires a bit of care.  Make sure you get the strip length right, and insert the wire smoothly, ideally in one go.  If it gets crumpled, it’s not going to go well.",
