For the Crescendo season, our robot used the Phoenix Tuner X Swerve codebase which improved it’s smoothness a lot, but a problem we have is that our code runs entirely off of commands. This is an issue because CommandScheduler tends to only run one command at a time (from my understanding), leaving our robot’s movements kind of clunky, for lack of a better word. It also just seems kind of messy in general, because our Commands folder ends up having about 20 files and it becomes tedious to sort through all of them.\n\nIn the Behind the Bumpers videos, I hear programmers talking about states, and how a lot of stuff can be consolidated within them. I’m becoming more interested in how to implement this to our code, could anybody provide more information? Thanks in advance : )",

                    "cooked": "If you aren’t aware of the concept, I would suggest looking into the Finite State Machine (FSM).  This is a high-level concept in programming which I think could help in your research.  I learned about Finite State Machines through the facet of Game Development, and it has become very helpful to me in FRC programming.  As an example, here’s a common implementation in game dev.  When programming a player character, you very often have complicated combinations of logic.  If the player is on the ground and the jump button is pressed, then the player should jump, but if the player is touching a wall then they should wall-jump, and if the roll button is pressed when the player is on the ground but the jump button is also pressed then they player should roll but not jump, etc. etc.  The easiest way to program this logic seems to be with a long chain of boolean and if / else statements, but as you can imagine, this quickly becomes unwieldy.  Instead, you can implement a Finite State Machine by writing classes (or other abstractions depending on your language) to represent each possible state of the player.  You could make a Jumping state, a Walking state, and a Falling state.  Then you make transitions between them.  So in the Walking state, you have logic that transitions to the Jumping state if the jump button is pressed.  In the Falling state, you have logic that transitions to the Walking state if the player touches the ground.  This naturally stops invalid scenarios from occurring.  Notice that, due to the simple rules that were set up, the player will never jump when it’s not on the ground and will automatically be able to walk when it falls back onto the ground. To be honest, I’ve had struggles making FSMs work well for systems with a lot of inputs and independent logic, like an FRC robot.  As @Oblarg mentioned, Commands are kind of an implementation of FSMs (with some big changes)—I’ve had struggles with Commands too, but that’s a topic for another post.  Regardless, I still think FSM’s are a good concept to understand, and they’ve certainly helped me think of how to write better code.",

As an example, this past season my team had a shooter with variable shoot speed, shoot angle, and feeder wheel speed.  We had “presets”—combinations of shoot speed, angle, and feed speed—that we had tuned to be accurate for each side of the speaker.  I decided to implement these as enumerated states within the shooter subsystem, and only have the set of possible enumerated states accessible through its public API.  Looking back, this was a bad decision, and resulted in a lot of complex and tangled state between the subsystem and its commands.  But, to this day, I’m not sure if putting all the state in the commands would really have been a better option due to the amount of data that should really be encapsulated within the subsystem. So, ideally, yes, you have all the state in the commands and they run as a FSM (or really, multiple FSMs) with the subsystems being purely tools with purely combinational logic.  But, in reality, this may not be done.  Personally, I feel like the Command-Based framework can easily be misused in a variety of ways, and needs to come with more rigid rules in order to actually be useful.  I am considering moving my team away from it and towards a more simplistic and rigid state-based system.",

                    "cooked": "I’m still not convinced that putting a ton of decisions and multiple states in one command is in the true spirit of Command-Based. @Oblarg could tell me “it’s okay” but I still coach my team to try for one state per command and put the if statements in the isFinished .  (And switch etc. are problematic except in a subsystem that defines a FSM controller that really is hard to define using simpler command-based techniques). (I’m not talking about the composed group commands that use sequential and parallel to perform a complex operation.)\n\nOP may be interested in my variety of examples I’ve put together in response to another CD thread. And Should you have State in Subsystems? (Java) - #7 by Jedi_4 has a nice example from their 2024 robot.\n\nThat post by @Jedi_4 inspired me to present a simpler example and to dust off an old FSM example. It uses command-based to create a Moore FSM of a transition being current state + Trigger → Command that is the new state. It’s in the MooreLikeFSM.java subsystem of https://github.com/tom131313/Example-LED with several examples included.\n\nThat FSM code looks complicated (bloated) only in its repetition since it has 8 states and 14 triggers that are essentially identical. It’s the Knight Rider Kitt red LED scanner. It runs in sim mode.\n\n(Sorry I didn’t implement the time lapsed gradient fade of the scanner - that adds more bloat to the example but I still might do it when I have more time. It might be very easy since the upcoming WPILib LED routines do a lot of heavy lifting for you.) image 1126×519 45.8 KB\n\nimage 1126×519 45.8 KB\n\nimage 1126×519 45.8 KB",
