That is, the command that will run if no other commands requiring m_swerve are running.\n\nThe key word there is requiring . In Command Based, the scheduler handles running Commands, and those Commands interact with subsystems. So to stop potential issues, Commands must specify which subsystems they require (generally those the Command intends to manipulate, not simply read from), so that the Scheduler will know if more than one Command for a Subsystem has been scheduled and respond accordingly, which by default is interrupting the older Command and starting the newer Command.\n\nHowever, nowhere in your driveWithJoystick class, or elsewhere, are you specifying what Subsystem object the Command requires. Going through the Subsystem Object’s .setDefaultCommand() method doesn’t actually set the requirement, you must ensure you are doing that.\n\nThe conventional way to do this with the current Command-Based Paradigm is to pass the Subsystem object into the Command as an argument to the Constructor, and have the Command save that passed object to a variable in the Command object to both interact with it and set the requirement. Like so:\n\nIn RobotContainer\n\nin driveWithJoystick\n\nand then later in the Command you can use m_subsystem.driveWithJoystick(true); instead of making everything static and reaching all over the place for objects in other Classes. Similarly you can use Lambda functions to pass in joystick functions and such to Commands to use within the commands instead of making your Joysticks Public and further complicating how inter-connected your code is.\n\nI recommend reading through the documentation on WPILIB’s site about Command Based Programming:\n\nThis sequence of articles serves as an introduction to and reference for the WPILib command-based framework. For a collection of example projects using the command-based framework, see Command-Base...\n\nas well as looking at some of the Command-Based examples provided to see how they handle Commands and their external Subsystem and Input requirements:\n\nWPILib example projects demonstrate a large number of library features and use patterns. Projects range from simple demonstrations of a single functionality to complete, competition-capable robot p...",

In the past we just made everything static and directly referenced it from other classes, and it does work, but WPILIB has tried to move away from that because it forms bad habits for students, especially those who may want to go on to work in a field involving Software Development, much like I did after I graduated High School.\n\nIn Computer Science and Software Engineering there are these concepts of Coupling and Cohesion. Cohesion is an important concept, but Coupling is the more relevant one in this particular instance. Its the measure of how much any one “module” or “unit” of code (often “Classes” are used as this unit in Java) is dependent or reliant on other to be able to function. Generally, good practice is to have as loose coupling as is reasonable.  Here is a great read on the subjects: Coupling and Cohesion\n\nSo by having Classes reaching directly into other Classes, or all into one central class, you have made everything very highly Coupled, which while in an FRC bot where you work on it for a couple months and its done, isn’t a big deal, applying that same practice to a real software project that will need to be supported for years or decades is going to make things much harder to maintain and extend as time goes on. So you are better served from an educational standpoint (which to me is much more important than the robot itself), to learn the modern methods of developing software, than just using the quick and dirty, get it done, method.\n\nSo by passing in requirements externally you create more flexible “modules” that can be viewed more as independent parts of a bigger picture of the code structure rather than as one whole, completely interlocked unit.",

For example, to pass a button as a data source you’ll want to do this:\n\nThis decouples the code even more, as you can pass a different supplier when testing or updating the code.\n\n6738 used the Trigger API, suppliers, etc a lot for 2021; feel free to look at our code.
