Feel free to poke around to other pages too for more explanation\n\nReport back here, or on the github PR\n\nThe focused questions I’m curious about:\n\nDid the simulation and the visuals run smoothly on your PC/browser? If not, what’s your setup?\n\nIf you’re already a “controls guru”, did the controls in the simulation act like you expect? Does the prose around it describe it well and correctly for FRC purposes?\n\nIf you’re new controls stuff, is the additional content approachable, and helpful in ramping up your knowledge?\n\nDid you walk away with a better understanding of how PID controllers should behave in different FRC contexts?\n\nHave fun, and all feedback is welcome! Speak your mind freely: Don’t hold back if you’re not sure of yourself on a topic, or worried it was already discussed, or worried our opinion might not be “correct”. I’m happy to filter and collate the conversations!",

Very well done!\n\nFeedback: Trying to implement the solution for Flywheel Tuning Step 2 and setting kV to 0.0075 as recommended you get the following error. image 1261×739 35.5 KB\n\nimage 1261×739 35.5 KB\n\nimage 1261×739 35.5 KB\n\nFor the flywheel simulation It would be helpful to explicitly note the maximum set point value of the system. After some digging I can guess its around 1500 rpm because I can’t seem to get the system to reach any values beyond that (Even with wild PID constants).\n\nI think it would also be helpful to draw the output line above all of the others on the graph. In the below picture you can not tell if the output is osculating or not because it is drawn behind the other lines. image 906×674 26.3 KB\n\nimage 906×674 26.3 KB\n\nimage 906×674 26.3 KB",

It looks great.\n\ngerthworm:\n\nIf you’re already a “controls guru”, did the controls in the simulation act like you expect? Does the prose around it describe it well and correctly for FRC purposes?\n\nN/A\n\ngerthworm:\n\nIf you’re new controls stuff, is the additional content approachable, and helpful in ramping up your knowledge?\n\nA few things: It would be nice to have parts of the graph appear as time goes on, not just show up all at once. This would be closer to what the students see while tuning a PID controller using glass or something like that and gives students a better idea of what is actually happening by being able to watch the rotational speed of the wheel and the graph.\n\nIs the control effort line on the graph necessary? When I’ve done these things on our robot I just plot the output (ex. desired vs. actual rpm) and found that worked well enough. Is this a non-optimal way of doing that? I’m sure there is a valuable part of intuition that is gained from seeing that part on the graph, but I am not 100% sure what it is right now. It also kind of blocks the red and blue lines, in my opinion, those two should be the most dominant.\n\nedit: After following the tuning solution, the green line makes a lot more sense. Some verbage about what the desired behavior of these lines would be helpful (or I missed them).\n\nFlywheel Specific\n\nIn the flywheel example, it would be nice to have a marker on the graph as to when the gamepiece is interjected or just put the line about the gamepiece higher up in the paragraph so it is more prominent.\n\nArm image 951×177 12.1 KB\n\nimage 951×177 12.1 KB\n\nimage 951×177 12.1 KB\n\nThis is miniscule, but the arm likes to do a full 360 when trying to get to its next setpoint rather than just taking the closest path. I don’t know if it would affect tuning, but it is funny.\n\nOverall A line or section about why you need to or should be tuning your PID controllers in realistic conditions (ex. tuning swerve drive PID on blocks vs. the ground) would be good because I know that was lost on me when I was first starting.",

The underlying logic is done in a mix of revolutions and radians ( RPM was purely for cosmetic display). Lemme do a walkthrough of the units and make sure things are internally consistent. At a minimum, while the system is overall ‘functional’, I would expect the thing you noticed to confuse a mathematically-inclined, detail-oriented student.\n\nAndrewI:\n\nTrying to implement the solution for Flywheel Tuning Step 2 and setting kV to 0.0075 as recommended you get the following error.\n\nYup that shouldn’t be there, will fix.\n\nAndrewI:\n\nFor the flywheel simulation It would be helpful to explicitly note the maximum set point value of the system. After some digging I can guess its around 1500 rpm because I can’t seem to get the system to reach any values beyond that (Even with wild PID constants).\n\nCan do - it’s a property of the underlying modeled motor and gearing (and is a good Segway into the “actuator saturation” common issue). Lemme do some thinking on how to handle this, whether it’s a “add more words” or just cap the text box input value.\n\nAndrewI:\n\nI think it would also be helpful to draw the output line above all of the others on the graph.\n\nSweet, this is easy!\n\nmdurrani834:\n\nIt would be nice to have parts of the graph appear as time goes on, not just show up all at once.\n\nMakes sense, and I like this idea from the perspective that it would look more like what a student will actually see on a robot.\n\nWould a moving cursor along the graph that’s time-synced with the animation fill the same purpose? Just thinking of alternates in case a full redraw is too resource-intensive for the average browser.\n\nmdurrani834:\n\nIs the control effort line on the graph necessary?\n\nedit: After following the tuning solution, the green line makes a lot more sense. Some verbage about what the desired behavior of these lines would be helpful (or I missed them).\n\nGot it. I can reorg a bit of the sections that talk about it in more detail.\n\nmdurrani834:\n\njust put the line about the gamepiece higher up in the paragraph so it is more prominent.\n\nGot it, seems easy enough to do.\n\nmdurrani834:\n\nThis is miniscule, but the arm likes to do a full 360 when trying to get to its next setpoint rather than just taking the closest path. I don’t know if it would affect tuning, but it is funny.\n\ncan you screenshot the gain set and plots used to cause this? I’ll try to reproduce.\n\nmdurrani834:\n\nA line or section about why you need to or should be tuning your PID controllers in realistic conditions (ex. tuning swerve drive PID on blocks vs. the ground) would be good because I know that was lost on me when I was first starting.\n\nExcellent idea, will do.",

You are definitely in the target audience so the feedback is valuable!\n\nD.Allred:\n\nFor a flywheel with feedforward only, why does the output vary with time?\n\nSo, at least in the nomenclature established in the WPILib docs, for the flywheel,\n\n“Setpoint” is the desired, commanded speed of the flywheel\n\n“Output” is the actual, measured speed of the flywheel\n\n“control effort” is the voltage applied to the motor\n\nI expect that with feedforward only, the voltage should step up to a constant value, and the actual speed of the flywheel should accelerate gradually (with, largely, exponential behavior).\n\nSo, with that in mind… does that help clarify what you’re seeing? If so, I can work to make sure those ideas are presented earlier rather than later.\n\nD.Allred:\n\nWhat is the output disturbance at T=5?\n\nIt’s a gamepiece being injected into the flywheel. It’s mentioned in one sentence buried in the middle of other explanation, but it’s definitely less than obvious.\n\nBased on multiple feedback comments on this, I’m actually thinking I might just expand the animation to show a ball making contact with the wheel and flying out.

It will get better or worse as you change the setpoint.\"\n\nDoes that imply the constants only work well for one setpoint? I changed the setpoint and see the  off.

I guess in the past I was under the impression the tuned values would work across a range of setpoints (ex different speeds for different distances from target). If we need different pid values for different setpoints how do we go about doing that? Can there be additional info on that?\n\nYes-ish. The underlying idea this is hitting at: Without feedforward, the details of how your system acts will change a lot based on setpoint. This is somewhat obvious in the flywheel case, and very obvious in the vertical arm.\n\nThe reason for the setpoint-hedge-words is to point people to the next step - add feedforward to the control, then the system behavior becomes more consistent for many setpoints.\n\nLemme do some thinking on rewording though, to better communicate that intent. What you’re describing is definitely a valid controls strategy (“gain-scheduling”), but not what we’d be looking to have readers bite off at this point.",

Since this is in radians, I think it is going all the way around (2pi) and then some to reach what I told it to do, which makes sense. Would be great if it could be optimized on the backend the same way that swerve module angles are since that is more intuitive (I would think). Would also be nice for it to be in degrees since teams will probably first think of degree setpoints first when putting in values for the setpoint (I did too before I read the axis titles).",

Yup this is expected, the setpoint input is in radians of arm rotation, not final angular position.\n\nWhat I’ll likely do - just cap the text box input at a -pi to pi range. It’s rare an arm can mechanically go all the way around like that anyway.\n\nI’m also ok doing a cosmetic degrees display. It’s the way I think as well.

It’s mentioned in one sentence buried in the middle of other explanation, but it’s definitely less than obvious.\n\nAh ha… you expected me to read before I turned the knobs!    I see game piece the explanation now.   You could show it in the animation or just label the graph.\n\nI’ve done a variety of control systems in my career dating back to proportional only mechanical devices or pneumatic PID - none of this fancy computer stuff.   But I just wasn’t paying attention closely.   Your “output” term is typically called the Process Variable.  And I usually think of “output” as the output of the controller or in more classic terminology the Control Variable.\n\nExcellent work though.   Love it.\n\nDavid",
