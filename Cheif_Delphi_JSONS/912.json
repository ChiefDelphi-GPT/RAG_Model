                    "cooked": "We’ve recently tried to switch from Megatag to Megatag 2 with our Limelight 3G, and while we have it functioning at a basic level, I feel like there is something we are missing in terms of how the robot sets itself up before a match starts.\n\nThe core of the question revolves around the Pigeon 2’s yaw reading being accurate to the actual rotation of the robot on the field, as it’s what we pass in to the Limelight to use for Megatag 2 processing.\n\nWe are using the CTRE Swerve generated template with SDS modules and a Pigeon 2 as our gyro. Right now, when the drivetrain is constructed upon boot, it sets the yaw for the Pigeon 2 to “0”. In order for this to work on the field, we carefully place the robot on the field against either the nearest or furthest sides of the reef, or the driver’s station wall as being the most consistent options available and face it away from the drivers station. Then we turn the robot on, wait until it finishes booting, so that the pigeon is zeroed, and then move it to our autonomous starting location and start the match from there.\n\nWe knew, even when we came up with this strategy, that this is not typical of robots on the field. We are trying to figure out how to properly zero the pigeon without needing to depend so heavily on this setup, and instead just placing it for our auto (as precisely as we can), like other teams seem to do.\n\nI’ve seen threads tha talk about how we should be using PathPlanner to seed our odometry at the beginning of auto, which we are, but my understanding is that this doesn’t zero the pigeon, it just helps the drivetrain determine its offsets from the Pigeon’s measurements for its rotation pose. So this would result in our Limelight having the wrong orientation for Megatag 2, and therefore would have bad pose estimations from the Limelight.\n\nIs the correct solution for this to just place our robot for auto, know what angle that is relative to “forward” for field-centric, and modify our start-up routine to set the pigeon to that angle instead of 0? For example, if the robot starts auto facing the alliance wall, we use 180 degrees instead of 0 when we are “zeroing” it.\n\nOur entire repository is public, but here are a couple of snippets of the things we are doing:\n\nThis is an example of us zeroing the pigeon in our drivetrain constructor\n\nThis is how we are updating the robot orientation for the Limelight",

I do not have a massive dataset for comparison, but in Indiana, all 3 of the top EPA robots (868, 7457, 1501) use this method of starting their robot aligned with the reef, then moving it to its auto position after getting its initial angle.\n\nBy ALWAYS zeroing the robot on the reef, you are eliminating potential yaw error by trying to guess what your initial yaw is. I do not think there is anything wrong with what you are doing, and I do not think there is any reason to try to change.\n\nEDIT: Also, make sure you know that a yaw of 0 should always correlate to the front of the robot facing the RED alliance drive stations. This is critical for getting proper MegaTag2 poses.\n\nEDIT 2: Also, you do not need to directly interface with the Pigeon2 when setting and reading yaw. The line you have commented out:\n\nLimelightHelpers.SetRobotOrientation(ll, drivetrain.getState().Pose.getRotation().getDegrees(), 0, 0, 0, 0, 0);\n\nis the correct way to send the LL the current yaw, and inside of your CTRE swerve subsystem, you can just use:\n\nresetRotation(new Rotation2d(0));\n\nto “zero” your yaw. Please note that Rotation2d() takes rotation values in radians, not degrees.",

So this would result in our Limelight having the wrong orientation for Megatag 2, and therefore would have bad pose estimations from the Limelight.\n\nFrom what I can tell, most teams that set the standard deviation of the theta component to a fairly large value (since heading from vision is less trustworthy than from your IMU), and practically infinity with Megatag 2. In that case, the pose estimate’s heading ( getState().Pose.getRotation() ) can be used for the Limelight robot orientation since it’s mostly (if not entirely) derived from odometry instead of vision.\n\nIf you really need to use the Pigeon 2 yaw directly (which can also be fetched using getState().RawHeading ), then you would have to override seedFieldCentric , resetRotation , and resetPose to all adjust the Pigeon 2 yaw and make sure that takes effect before calling the super implementation. However, I would recommend against using the Pigeon 2 yaw directly when possible. Regardless, an example is shown below.",
