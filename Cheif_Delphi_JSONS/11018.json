                    "cooked": "Okay, so we bought AndyMark Swerve and Steer modules because they were all we could find at the time of purchasing we have managed to get the wheels to go forwards and backwards, but the rotation is currently super wacky.\n\nFirst off, we cloned the repository from the following video and have been trying to modify it to fit our robot, but have so far not been successful. This is the first year we have used Java, and we don’t have anybody with a ton of programming experience with Java on our team either.\n\nmaster/%236%20Swerve%20Drive%20Auto\n\nThe exact source code used in 0 to Autonomous in FRC Java\n\nSecondly I’ll layout exactly how we got to where we’re at.\n\nWe purchased andymark swerve and steel pre-assembled modules\n\nWe swapped the CIM motors that came on them with NEO Brushless Motors.\n\nWe kept the PG71 Gearmotors as the steering motors. (These came with built in “Two Channel Hall Effect” encoders.)\n\nWe purchased MA3-Absolute Encoders from Andymark and connected them to the modules in the proper place and attached them with 40 tooth gears.\n\nWe wired everything.\n\nSo at this point in time we have the NEO Brushless motors as drive motors and those are connected via SparkMax’s on the CAN Network.\n\nThe PG71 Gearmotors are setup also using SparkMax’s on the CAN Network. We also added MA3 Absolute Encoders to the modules and wired those into the ANALOG ports on the RoboRIO.\n\nWe have a NavX2 plugged into the big port in the Middle of the RoboRIO and the lights come on.\n\nRight now I think our biggest problem is that the code we have started with wasn’t written for the same swerve modules, and we don’t know all the parts of the code that need to be changed to work with our Swerve and Steer Modules.\n\nDoes anybody reading this have Java code that worked for Andymark Swerve and Steer modules? Or if not Java then possibly LabView. We are struggling a lot with this, and are willing to go down some other routes if needed.\n\nOtherwise with our code in it’s current state the next problem we have to conquer is getting our chassisspeeds variable inputed into the proper spot. (We can go deeper on explaining this if somebody reading this wants to help, but I’ve already put a lot on here and don’t want to overdo it right now)\n\nIf anybody on here has gotten Andymark Swerve and steer to properly drive could we take a look at your code.\n\nAnymore questions about our setup feel free to reply, and we’ll try to respond as quickly as possible.\n\nThanks!",

There may be a little more “play” in the rotational gearing and the modules are overall higher than some of the newer mechanics, but rest assured that they drive just fine. There are, however, several things that need to come together with any swerve drive, so best go step by step. Implement PID control (just P may suffice) for the rotation. Read the absolute encoder and have the module rotate to the desired angle within one degree. Figure out what offset angle you  need per module to point each module “straight ahead”. Then control the speed of the driver, using feed-forward, to be at desired speeds. Then put that together, for example using the edu.wpi.first.math.kinematics.SwerveDriveKinematics , which you feed the desired robot moves and it tells you what angle and speed to run on each swerve module.",

The MA3 output is sent to the Sparkmax (we are using talonsrx for our pg71s)  analog input. The input is 0-3.3v and the MA3 is 0-5v (really 5*0.8 if I remember the datasheet) so you will need to electrically scale that voltage down. You can use a voltage divider, which is a pair of resistors. Connect to usb and open the spark max client and make sure the readings are as expected. Basic position control code is here but you need to adapt for brushed motor:\n\nmaster/Java/Analog%20Feedback%20Device\n\nExample code for SPARK MAX. Contribute to REVrobotics/SPARK-MAX-Examples development by creating an account on GitHub.\n\nOnce that works you can integrate with the swerve drive code of your choosing. @nstrike offered us to try their library in another discussion.\n\nI am happy to detail each of these steps but I was not sure if you want to go down the same route. There is nothing wrong with sending the encoder output to the rio but I prefer the motor controllers do all the work. It makes life easier.",

If your only encoder is connected to the roboRio, you will have to run PID on the rio (this is how your codes is set up now.)\n\nThis post provides the information you need for wiring the encoder to the Spark Max. You have a couple break-out board options: the REV SPARK MAX Data Port Breakout Board that @Skyehawk mentioned, or the CTRE Talon SRX Analog Breakout Board (I have successfully used this to connect a potentiometer to a Spark Max, it should work with your encoder too.)  Connect the encoder to 5V, GND, and ANA.\n\nIf you aren’t open to rewiring, you probably want to start by deleting the turningEncoder from your code and use your absoluteEncoder every place for the turning position.",

Our problem is that when we turn the turning motors, the turning motors stutter severely. We also have an issue where subtracting a constant from angle position to get our motor offset will yield inconsistent numbers for example, if we are getting a reading of 233 degrees with our drive wheels straight forward, when we subtract 233 for our offset, we will get a reading of -500 degrees.\n\nThank you for any help.",
