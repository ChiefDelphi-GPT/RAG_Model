                    "cooked": "Hello! We are trying to use Pathplanner’s PathfindtoPose command, but we’re running into multiple problems. I know there is a solution for each problem, but I’m having a hard time figuring out what they are. The lineup code works perfectly in simulation (without the Apriltags), so I’m thinking it has something to do with our AprilTags and Limelight. We’re using a Kracken drivetrain and the new Limelight 4 with MegaTag2.\n\nProblem #1: When I hit the path button, the robot drives to the default position in our switch case instead of to the tag it currently sees. We have our switch case connected to the TID value from the limelight, so for example, if it sees tag 7, it will drive to the left or right side of AprilTag 7 depending on if you hit the left or right trigger. This means our switch case isn’t updating with the correct tag. Problem #2: When we tested the lineup with the default tag in our switch case, the robot would drive away from the tag instead of towards it , or it would try to turn 180 degrees then stop when it lost sight of the tag. It is possible that our rotation2d is 180 degrees off, but our poses are definitely correct. My initial guess is that something is wrong with the Limelight Field-Space Localization or Pathplanner’s Autobuilder.\n\nI did attempt to bypass the switch case by making a pathfind command in RobotContainer, but that ran into the same issues. Our switch case, limelight, and Pathplanner AutoBuilder are located in CommandSwerveDrivetrain.java, and the button command is in RobotContainer. I would greatly appreciate someone more experienced than me to look at our code and see if you can find any issues with our switch case or Pathplanner/Limelight configuration. Here is our code: https://github.com/team5675/2025Robot . Thank you for your help!",

When you press right trigger, if your limelight can’t see a tag, the command should be printing “Warning: No valid AprilTag detected.

I did use Pathplanner’s telemetry window, and the button activated the path, but the robot either turned 180 degrees then stopped when it lost sight of the tag or it tried to move but was unsuccessful. The path runs perfectly in simulation, however, and here is a video showing it: https://youtu.be/ZjrR40I3IdY .\n\nWhen I was troubleshooting, one of the problems I fixed was Pathplanner starting the path from (0,0) instead of the robot pose, and I fixed that by putting this.m_poseEstimator.getEstimatedPosition() in the AutoBuilder. Before, it was getState().Pose, which was always returning (0,0) instead of the current pose. Could that be the same for getState().Speeds? Could that be an issue if Speeds also returns zero?

We’re using Limelight MegaPose2 to add vision measurements, so I’m wondering how that impacts Pathfinder’s Pathfind to Pose?\n\nThere’s two Pose’s being averaged together, one from Dead-Reckoning, and the other from Vision. Adding the Vision Pose into the average corrects the Dead-Reckoning Pose which drifts over time. PathPlanner can run a path without vision. It can work just fine with the robots Dead-Reckoning Odometry.\n\nIf your drivetrains dead-reckoning Pose isn’t correct. That’s a problem. If your visions Pose isn’t correct. That’s probably a bigger problem.\n\nTake it a step at a time. Comment out the line for adding vision measurements. Make sure the drivetrains dead reckoning is accurate. Make a path that drives the robot forward a meter, waits a second, and then back a meter. Make sure it hits the same marks ever time. This should be really close, like a few inches.\n\nAdd back in your vision, make sure that in the limelight webGUI the Pose it’s reporting is correct.",

I’m not sure why, but when I started our robot yesterday, the yaw flipped 180 degrees again, so I commented out the if(DriverStation.getAlliance().orElse(Alliance.Blue) == Alliance.Red) {             redAllianceYaw += 180;         } code and it worked again. Maybe it has something to do with our Pigeon, but I can’t explain why I sometimes need to flip the yaw 180. We are turning the robot on in the same orientation too. Is it a good idea to manually reset the Pigeon’s yaw to zero (this.getPigeon2().setYaw(0)) when the robot is turned on or will that mess with the limelight’s pose estimation if the robot isn’t facing forward?",
