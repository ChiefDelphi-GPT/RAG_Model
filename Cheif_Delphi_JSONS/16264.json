                    "cooked": "I am thinking of running a design challenge starting near the end of December. It will be open to all; students, mentors, and other community members. Think of this as something similar to a CADathon, but you (can) also discuss potential software implementations. Instead of a single game with an auton, teleop, and endgame, there would be three categories. These would all be more like skills challenges (if this were to take place in real life, it would just be one robot trying to perform the task). As such, there will be less emphasis on strategy and tradeoffs, and more on performance . This is the time to make the elite bot you always wanted to but never could!\n\nAs of right now the three categories would be shooting , placing , and hanging . I am really trying to break the traditional mold of FIRST games and force participants to think outside the box in terms of mechanism design and implementation. Do not expect a 27’ by 54’ carpeted field, or a field at all\n\nI am thinking that the deliverables will be renders of each subsystem, the entire robot, and the robot performing the different tasks. As well, a PDF summarizing the functions of your robot. At this time I am thinking that I want all submissions to be done on Chief, but I know people like using Discord (which I don’t use very much but am open to learning).\n\nIn terms of scoring, I will be judging all these submissions (yes, subjective). I will split things up into best overall and best student-only in each category. Additionally, I am open to having the community vote to see who they think the winner in each category should be as a side. Submission window about a week long. I would be posting to Chief the results. If the margins are very close between teams, I may do something similar to a tier list where I group together submissions of similar quality.\n\nIf you are interested, please comment below! If this gains traction, I will send out more information in the coming weeks leading to, along with some hints! As well, if you have experience in running something like this any feedback on how I could run things on my end would be greatly appreciated.",

Late December is a busy time for many people, and a lot of school teams will be on holiday break. And then FRC kickoff is in early January, which, let’s face it, is the primary focus of the entire program.\n\nI doubt our team would choose to peel off a subgroup to work on a challenge that isn’t directly related to fielding our 2022 FRC competition 'bot during that time period. I think you might have better participation if you scheduled this earlier in preseason, or in the off-season.",
