The potential for a battery falling out on the field is just too great, and don’t forget that this will get you immediately disabled (per rule G101) and may result in other penalties, especially if it happens more than once.\n\nWe had a similar problem with our Steamworks robot and the solution was to cut an access hole through the front frame rail (it was a Kit frame) that we slide the battery through and into a secure horizontal mount. It kept the battery low in the frame, probably in a space much like the one you’re trying to fit your battery into. Since it was still inside the frame, over the intact belly pan, and had bumpers completely covering it, it worked out fine. That was the season that we developed our own quick-removal bumper system too, for fairly obvious reasons.",

                    "cooked": "We did this with our 2020/21 robot; the battery is flat under the ball hopper, and there’s an access panel beneath it.  The intention was to change batteries from underneath, and we did so at one event (the one we made it to in 2020).\n\nIt was not pleasant.\n\nBattery swaps involved multiple students carefully supporting the robot on its side while other students removed the access panel, wrestled the heavy battery out, reached in and disconnected it, connected the new one, and tried to slip it into place without damaging or pinching any wires/pneumatic lines or dropping the battery.  As there were several controllers mounted to the hopper immediately above, this was not easy, and there were times we’d do a systems check and find we broke something, and have to do it all again (after fixing whatever we broke).\n\nAfter that event we never did it again.  We would dump air, cut a couple of zip ties, and unbolt the hopper so we could (much more easily and carefully) exchange the battery from the top - not fighting gravity was worth it.\n\nBased on that experience, my advice is to try very hard not to do a from-beneath swap, and if you absolutely must, make sure the access is as easy as possible and there’s nothing immediately nearby prone to damage during a battery-swap.  And yes, do make sure whatever you use to secure it is not going to come loose and drop your battery (we did not have that problem).\n\nOur rookie-year (Steamworks) robot had a flat-on-the-bottom battery too, but we were able to provide access from one side so it could slide in and out, with a hard-mount for the SB50 so we could reach in and connect/disconnect it.  Maybe something like that is an option for you.  I see @Strategic just posted that they did something similar for that game too.",

We created a cutout in our belly pan that led to an inverted battery tray and a plate that supported the battery from underneath. This plate had 4 holes that would allow it to be bolted to the robot securing the battery via a custom threaded “nut bar” that essentially eliminated the need for nuts and a wrench. To reduce change over times we would simply tip the robot back and use a particular electric screwdriver that would deliver just enough torque to remove and recasted the bolts without causing damage or risk crossthreading. This worked seamlessly through all our events and practice sessions.  I’ll have to see if I can dig up a picture of the assembly.\n\nIn summary it can be done, but it should be done in a well planned, well executed and well practiced manner.",

I would suggest creating a sawhorse station that allows you to put your bot on it and have access to the bottom so you can easily switch batteries without having to tip your robot. We don’t favor doing a bottomside mount just do to some hassle, but its necessary, full steam ahead. Hope this helps!",

The standoff by the battery terminals is removed with two 1/4-20 thumbscrews and the battery is pivoted out. The battery box is lined with foam to prevent it from shifting.\n\nThe white robot (2019) is encapsulated by a plate with 4 screws in it; these were screwed into standoffs mounted on the top.\n\nI don’t think we ever came across an inspection issue with either of these nor have we ever had a battery fall out of the robot.\n\nPXL_20210530_205517404.MP 3024×4032 3.4 MB IMG_20190306_225606 3024×4032 3.68 MB\n\nPXL_20210530_205517404.MP 3024×4032 3.4 MB\n\nPXL_20210530_205517404.MP 3024×4032 3.4 MB\n\nIMG_20190306_225606 3024×4032 3.68 MB\n\nIMG_20190306_225606 3024×4032 3.68 MB",

For example, a KoP horizontal battery mount that’s loaded from below is likely OK.  A design where the chassis constrains the battery up, back, left, and right and a bolted-in angle bracket constrains down and forward is likely OK.  However, any situation which requires a bottom mounted battery has, in the words of a now-retired co-worker, “a lot of ugly potential”; you’re going to draw extra scrutiny.  [not that that’s a bad thing, just a thing]\n\nBottom line: be ready to convince your RI (and LRI ) that you’re in compliance with R606.  If you have serious doubts that you can do this, you should go and re-think your life battery mounting.\n\nR606 *Secure the battery. The ROBOT battery must be secured such that it will not dislodge during vigorous ROBOT interaction including if the ROBOT is turned over or placed in any arbitrary orientation.",
