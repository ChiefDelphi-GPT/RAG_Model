A handful of folks from all over have been working together to understand things as best as we can. Aaron from 1768 and Chris from 3128 have sent me a pile of materials to test, covering legal and some not-yet-legal options. Assembled bumper test sections from @anon91718515 and crew should arrive any day now.\n\nSome ground rules for this effort:\n\nConsider this much like 95’s build threads: interactive. I am happy to accommodate reasonable requests for additional testing, different approaches to analyses, and answer as many questions as I can. This interactivity helps to drive the thread in the direction you, the audience, are most interested in.\n\nI am going to break up testing and results sets across many posts. To do otherwise would make us all insane and further delay the distribution of results.\n\nWe’re only going to test core examples of materials. I cannot test every permutation of of every material/vendor/whatever at every strain rate and load situation. My time and patience are finite.\n\nOnly first-order effects are being considered. There will be a million and one reasons why these data and conclusions are not 100% applicable to your own situation. See 1. The aim here is to get an 80% answer for almost everyone and provide skills so everyone can get where they need to go.\n\nThe best is the enemy of good enough. I am using a traceably-calibrated load tester with currently available tooling for these tests. This lets me walk into the lab, test over my lunch break, and have everything back in order quickly. I am not going to rework tools/machines/whatever to perfectly fit them for robot impact analysis. We would all still be waiting for results as competition started. See 3. and 4.\n\nAnswers provided here are to be considered generalized. There will be no ‘this is the best’ conclusion or ‘the right answer for you is…’ This is simply the nature of fundamental level testing and analysis like this. It will help steer us all in the right direction(s) but is not a replacement for full-scale robot-level testing. What it will provide is a level of understanding to limit the number of full-scale robot tests any one team will have to do and help steer adjustments of bumper design.\n\nImportant Posts\n\nTest Setup\n\nConventional Noodle Bumpers\n\nSolid Noodle Degradation Closer Look\n\nValidation and Degradation Comparison\n\nInitial Look at Composite Foam Construction\n\nBroadside Collision Analysis\n\ntl;dr\n\nComposite Bumper Deeper Dive\n\nTesting Round 3\n\nImportant/Incipient Edits: Bug in processing code didn’t convert grams to Newtons initially.

The following data is from a sample bumper we constructed for this purpose. The ‘fresh’ tests from solid and hollow noodles are illuminating if unsurprising.\n\nimage 1257×920 42.4 KB\n\nimage 1257×920 42.4 KB\n\nimage 1257×920 42.4 KB\n\nThey way to interpret these plots is that ‘distance’ is how far the bumper as squished and ‘force’ is how much force a truss pole applies to deform the bumper that distance. Integrating under the curve shows how much energy is absorbed by the bumper (both as potential energy and dissipated through losses).\n\nWe see pretty clearly that solid noodles can absorb more energy and are ‘stiffer’ than hollow noodles. Both noodles start to get ‘solid’ towards the upper end of the displacement distance. As the Force/Distance slope steepens the bumpers have a stiffer spring rate.\n\nTesting the same segment of solid noodle bumper over and over shows a steady degradation in the material.\n\nimage 1158×883 42.1 KB\n\nimage 1158×883 42.1 KB\n\nimage 1158×883 42.1 KB\n\nThe shifting start point of each curve shows how far the bumper has been crushed. The damaged material has less ‘area under the curve’ so to speak, and cannot absorb as much energy as fresh material can.\n\nThe biggest change is after the first step, which is also the only time we really heard cells popping in the noodles.\n\nStay tuned. There is so much more to come!",

E.g. worse across the board.\n\nimage 1179×910 23 KB\n\nimage 1179×910 23 KB\n\nimage 1179×910 23 KB\n\nPlotting with peak load synchronized we see that the degraded noodle has taken a set on the order of 6mm based on the difference in start positions.\n\nimage 1181×896 23 KB\n\nimage 1181×896 23 KB\n\nimage 1181×896 23 KB\n\nAfter writing that out I think I understand your actual question. To answer that: it doesn’t take much load to start popping cells. Most people can grab a noodle and pop cells under very low loads.\n\ntruher:\n\nis it weird that the crushed profile seems to have those prominent valleys corresponding the the edges of the anvil?\n\nIt is not weird. The tested material is damaged, the cells certainly pop. The un-tested material right next to it is much less damaged (or not at all) and recovers more completely.\n\ntruher:\n\nyeah, the weird part to me is that the impression has a bump in the middle, like the edges are more squished than the middle.\n\nThat’s because of the space left from from the counterbored bolt (that is facing down). The very center where the c’bore is does not get squished quite as much as the rest of the material.",

I look forward to seeing the results!\n\nI’ve seen some teams experimenting with using either TPU printed corners or a corner backer made from PVC pipe cut into 3/4\" curves. I am wondering if there are plans for testing such a setup, if that’s even doable on the device you’ve calibrated.\n\nFor the backer rods, you mentioned more permanent deformation in the hollow pool noodles. Which of the two seems to have more overall impact absorption? I hope I am reading these graphs correctly, I am an amateur relative to the MatSci field. Personally I would prefer to damage a noodle via proximity to 2056 and replace between tournaments than have a less damaged bumper but it absorbs less of the impact.",
