The motors that we have right now are 8 Falcons and 8 Neos, so we only have enough for 4 modules. We are using SDS MK4i (L2) modules. Our current plan is to have the driving motor be a Neo and the steering motor be a Falcon, since this will allow us to have 5 modules. Before we proceed with this plan, we would like to hear of other team’s experiences doing this.\n\nQuestions we have:\n\nWhich motor should we use for driving?\n\nIs there any preexisting code for this?\n\nWould it be better to have only 4 modules and use the same motors for driving and steering?",

Me, as the lead programmer, had to figure out how to program them. I started with the library given be SDS but turns out it’s old and not very efficient. Switched to base falcon swerve and it only supports falcons. Found a neo version of base falcon swerve and it had problems. Fixed those problems with much pain but now I have experience, yay .\n\nI recommend for you to use BaseFalconSwerve except you will have to do some tweaking for the neos\n\nIf you have any question I’ll try to answer them.\n\nContribute to Team364/BaseFalconSwerve development by creating an account on GitHub.",

Since turning a wheel requires less torque than driving it, i agree with your decision of using neos for driving and falcons for steering.",

                    "cooked": "We had a similar situation this past season.  Eight Falcons from previous stock, but lots of NEOs.  We’ve found that Falcons give us a bit more ground speed for a given gear ratio.  It’s a nice little boost without moving to a higher gear ratio and a lot more speed but less torque.  We chose to run Falcons on drive and NEOs on steering.  This gave us enough Falcons to have spares, but we got the little speed boost and we got the Falcon velocity control advantage for odometry.\n\nI don’t know if there is any pre-existing code for doing this or not.  It’s not particularly hard to create objects and call methods for both Falcons and NEOs. Rev has some nice syntax conversion documentation that’s useful whether you have experience coding for Falcons or for NEOs.\n\nAs long as you are constrained to eight Falcons and eight NEOs, it’s a much better plan to mix them on your modules so you have spares.  If you get more of either, your decision opens up again.  Teams have been successful with NEO/NEO, Falcon/NEO, and Falcon/Falcon.  It’s really your choice about which ecosystem(s) you want to support, your ability to purchase particular motors, your take on pros/cons of integrated vs separate motor and controller, and how you feel about cost differences.",

As other suggested above, the Falcon is debatably slightly stronger than the NEO but it really won’t make a big difference. The difference comes in the motor controllers.\n\nNEOs have a known issue with the filtering on the closed-loop velocity controller which may make tuning your drive PID harder. And if there is a power advantage, you want the stronger motor on drive.\n\nThe SPARK MAX have the ability to take direct input from an absolute encoder. If you were using Falcons, you would need to use either a CANcoder or the RIO as a middleman. With the MAX, you can get absolute position feedback for the swerve angle without having to add devices to the CAN bus or manually code it through the RIO.",

No real functional difference.  The motors could be attached directly to the upper plate rather than using the long screws and spacers as-designed which is kind of a functional advantage.  You, of course, lose the motor protection and add some obstacles to design around above the chassis, but if that’s not a showstopper, it looks like this would be an easy change.\n\nIf those motors got hit, there is a good chance of bending the upper plate, so this would not be a mod that just anyone should try, but in a pinch, there is some value.",
