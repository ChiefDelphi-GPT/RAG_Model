It should be a priority to assist the build team when needed.\n\nDesign mechanisms that are easy to build right and hard to build wrong. This can be hard to do or train, but if a reasonable person can’t assemble something properly with the CAD open in front of them its probably too complex. Avoid parts that look almost the same but aren’t. Avoid parts that can be put on backwards, this can be done by making mounting holes irregular so the hole only line up when installed properly or by making parts reversable so it doesn’t matter.\n\nIf a part can be easily left out but not easily identified as missing after assembly, is in necessary or did build just improve the design? Assuming it is necessary, BOMs are very easy to export from CAD so print one out check off every part before you get started and make sure everything gets used.\n\nExpect assemblies to be misassembled. I have written assembly instructions for products in my job, and the way we did it was to build the product from CAD while making notes, repeatedly if necessary to figure out how to do it efficiently, then write the instructions and take pictures of the assembly process. You can encourage the designers to think through assembly as they design mechanisms (this comes back to cross-training) and write down assembly tips but in general you just have to expect to have some assembly errors and plan in time to fix them.",

We did have to recut all our arm pieces because our tolerances weren’t close enough and what helped a lot was creating technical drawings of every part for the arm and then changing the manufacturing approach to get better tolerances.\n\nMy recommendation would be to make technical drawings that specify tolerances and manufacturing methods as a stop gap, but really I think you need your designers and builders to talk to each other more. I recommend that at minimum every time you hand a builder a part you talk to them about what the critical dimensions are and how precise you need to be and then talking again before they assemble the cut parts to make sure that they understand what they need to do.\n\nAs far as missing parts, I’d recommend that you give them a bill of materials for each assembly so that they can check they have each part as they go along. One thing we did this year that I liked was printing out one technical drawing for every part (including duplicates) and then keeping that technical drawing with the part through fabrication.",

If designers don’t build, they may create designs that are difficult or impossible to build.  If build does not design, practical ideas and problem solutions may never make it to the design.  If design and build work together, a lot of things that would otherwise need to be documented with drawings can be handled more quickly with communication.\n\nDocumenting with drawings is the most common way to formally transfer information between teams.  Drawings are often used to show details for individual part fabrication.  However, Onshape also makes it pretty easy to create exploded views to aid in assembly.  These exploded views can be put in drawings.  Here is one video out of many that can be found that concisely shows how to create drawings with an exploded view and a bill of materials.\n\nDesign can help build by creating logical subassemblies with complete bills of materials.  Build can reduce issues with missing parts if they kit all the parts they need (custom fabricated and COTS) for each subassembly before they start working on it.",

Your designers should know how any part they are designing is going to be manufactured, and based on that they should be able to pretty easily create  the necessary documentation. For CNC parts you’ll probably want some system to track part fabrication, but this a weak point of my team so I’m not going to try to suggest anything. With manual milled parts, teach your designers to make basic drawings (pictured), don’t worry about getting everything perfect just good enough to manufacture. I recommend having standard tolerances for different operations, manual milling for us is ± .005\" unless otherwise noted. For many things you might not need a drawing, For shafts and tubes we just have cut lists. For shafts we list stock, length, and thread size if tapped, with the expectation that everything will be square off the lathe and withing .005\" preferably .001\". For tubes we usually only care about the number of holes, so a nominal length is all we need with the expectation that all tube cuts align with a hole and the tolerance is +0.0\", -0.1\" or so. image 1408×775 25.5 KB\n\nimage 1408×775 25.5 KB\n\nimage 1408×775 25.5 KB",

Since design and build happen fast we don’t always do a perfect job of creating drawings from the OnShape models.   It depends on the complexity of the assembly.      Here are a few suggestions:\n\nWe review the design progress and current model on a classroom monitor to the full team at the beginning of our meetings.     Early on, it’s just 2d and 3d doodles before the design gets detailed for build.    Build is constantly providing feedback during the life cycle of the design.\n\nWe will usually print assembly and parts drawings with key dimensions and text notes pointing out the critical items.\n\nAn exploded view would be used assemblies that are more difficult to understand.\n\nIn all cases, we just go over the drawings or CAD as a hand-off step.    Build would never be given content without a discussion.\n\nGood luck with your process!\n\nDavid",

The designers make drawings of the parts and this year we started making assembly drawings with exploded views. Typically we skip part drawings for sheet parts we run on the router (gussets and plates) but will make them for tubes, shafts, and gearbox plates (calling out critical dimensions). I’ve made a few drawings with manufacturing steps on some of our parts too. The exploded views go a long way to help assembly. As does a bill of materials table so whoever is assembling can find everything hey need before they start. This year I want us to get better at written assembly instructions in her notes. I’ll try to dig up an example this evening.",

To get from design to fabrication, we use basic engineering drawings, like the ones show above. To get from design to assembly, we have each main designer for a feature create an assembly workflow which is just a set of really detailed steps with step by step screenshots of cad showing “at this point this is what you should have”. It also specifies what nuts, bolts, and even tools you should need for each step. Then, even if the build people have no design knowledge (which most of them do), they can follow the instructions to build the feature correctly (the first time).",

At this level, it would take more time to write/draw/animate build instructions, than it would to just supervise the build in real time.",
