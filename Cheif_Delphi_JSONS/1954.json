As a community driven solution, any form of support helps us.\n\nDuring the FIRST Championship, some teams expressed their concern over the availability of Meta Quests in regions where it is not officially sold. QuestNav was created with the purpose to expand the availability of cheap, high quality localization to all teams. Not just those in countries where Quests are sold. As such, we are announcing today that we have decided to explore expanding support to the Pico 4 , which is officially sold in China, and is available in many other nations as well.\n\nToday, we are also announcing the release of comprehensive documentation for version v0.9 of QuestNav. This should help clear up a lot of frequently asked questions. The site is available at https://questnav.gg now! A lot will be changing between now and 2026, as such, documentation on this rolling release cycle may be delayed. We encourage teams to try QuestNav but be prepared for changes as we implement them.\n\nIn order to better assist teams, we are recommending people join our discord instead of using CD for support due to its real-time nature. Join here.\n\nAfter the 2025 season, many teams expressed interest in using the AprilTags on the field for initialization of QuestNav’s pose and validation of the VSLAM pose during the match. With the recent release of Meta’s Passthrough Camera API, we can utilize this along with the Spatial Anchoring API to provide a consistent and performant fiducial detector. This completely eliminates the need for any external devices that many teams previously used like LimeLights or PhotonVision. We expect this to remove the issues of human error in resetting the start pose, as well as accounting for edge cases that may—albeit very rarely—arise during the match.\n\nAlong with this, we plan to improve the connection robustness of the headset by implementing a more up-to-date NetworkTables library, and supporting alternative connection methods.\n\nIn the coming months we will be releasing a web-based log viewer for teams to easily debug any issues that may occur during use. This will also make it significantly easier to provide community support and hopefully allow us to assist more teams.\n\nWe expect some other miscellaneous changes to be made as well, but we wanted to outline the major ones. Be sure to keep an eye on the project roadmap and be sure to open an issue on GitHub if you have a feature suggestion!\n\nWe will be providing updates in this thread as new features are implemented and released to keep everyone informed. We hope to see a lot of Quests next year!\n\nBest,\n\nSean 5152 Lead Programmer & QuestNav PM FRC Team 5152 - Alotobots\n\n@juchong",

Now, we recommend you use the built-in API to reset the pose of the Quest on the Quest side. This differs from our previous method of resetting the pose with an offset on the robot code side.\n\nThis can be easily switched, and is documented in our new documentation! See here.\n\nThis change is highly recommended as we move towards getting AprilTag compatibility for various reasons, most notably it allows the Quest to maintain its own state, rather than being dependent on the robot code.\n\nHappy Questing!",

We are doing some items to mitigate it however.\n\nWe are in the process of switching over to natively run NetworkTables on the Quest side, which will give us significantly faster response and loop times. Along with this, we are transitioning to using protobufs for the command frames, which will include timestamps for latency compensation.\n\nYou can also “fix” this issue before the native NetworkTable release is ready by doing something like this:\n\nSome code from 5152’s 2025 repo\n\nHere is the link to the getAutoStartPose method\n\nThis essentially just resets the auto start pose whenever the new auto is selected, rather than when the auto starts.\n\nObviously not a perfect solution, but it should be a stopgap until we can get the new version working! The main reason why this switch is necessary as a whole is due to AprilTag detection as stated previously. You don’t necessarily have to switch yet, but it may be advantageous for your team to do it prior to the AprilTag feature’s release.",

This took a little work to figure out, but it can be done by calling a different constructor in TunerConstants .\n\nCTRE does use a different timestamp, and this is kind of a problem, but starting in Tuner X 2025.3.1.0 the generated CommandSwerveDrivetrain has an AddVisionMeasurement overide that already handles this.

There are a few known issues with the current build, but nothing critical. It is definitely an improvement over the previous version, however!\n\nTo migrate from older versions we recommend you simply start fresh and follow the updated quick-start documentation again due to the amount of changes.\n\nRobot Code Setup Link\n\ngetLatency method is only accurate for a small amount of time after the robot code starts, then starts slowly drifting towards a more negative value\n\nIf you find an issue, get support in the Discord and create a GitHub issue.\n\nThanks again for the support, and happy Quest-ing!\n\nLINK TO RELEASE",
