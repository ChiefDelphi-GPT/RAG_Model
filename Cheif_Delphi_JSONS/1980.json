                    "cooked": "This season, team 3414 explored a variety of methods in terms of alignment. We settled on one strategy we found worked “well enough”, but in the background, we were developing a new, and much more elegant, solution; unfortunately, we never got to run it before CMP . But we got right back to work after we got the robot back home, and we were (happily) shocked by how well it worked. We continued adding better features to the program, which we dubbed Autopilot. Now, with thorough testing at IRI and during drive practice,  we’re excited to release Autopilot to the public.\n\nAutopilot is a control system for a 2 dimensional field that focuses on simplicity while retaining powerful features .\n\nAutopilot has a couple of different features that may interest teams:\n\nFast motion. Autopilot employs a hybrid motion profile that maximizes speed at the start of a path, but smoothness in the back end. More specifically, Autopilot will cause the robot to speed up at a constant acceleration, but then align with constant jerk - which means that we come to a very smooth stop.\n\nFast code. Autopilot is completely stateless, which means that it never tries to plan ahead into the future.\n\nNonlinear paths. Autopilot offers control over entry angle , which determines the end direction of the robot. This opens the possibilities of the original beeline drive-to-point to a whole new level.\n\nEasy to use. As a result of its stateless nature, Autopilot exposes a very simple API.\n\nAutopilot is one step up from simple “beeline” drive-to-point solutions that travel in a straight line, towards the target. Autopilot offers more features that allow for more control of the robot’s motion while still obeying the core values of “ simple yet powerful ”.\n\nInspired by the autonomous strategies of teams like 2056 and 2910, Autopilot maintains a few core aspects of the simple beeline controller:\n\nStateless design . Autopilot is completely stateless, and doesn’t generate any paths or trajectories. Like a well-tuned PID controller, Autopilot works off of clever design - given some state and a goal, an output can be constructed. Following this output will always drive the current state towards the goal - even though no actual “path” is planned. This means Autopilot “flights” are very inexpensive to calculate on-the-fly.\n\nStateless design . Autopilot is completely stateless, and doesn’t generate any paths or trajectories.

This means Autopilot “flights” are very inexpensive to calculate on-the-fly.\n\nNo hassle . Besides configuring maximum speed, acceleration, and jerk, Autopilot has very little actual configuration necessary. Define your motion constraints, desired behavior, and your target, and.. you’re done.\n\nNo hassle .

By not attempting to “think ahead”, Autopilot doesn’t perform any computation that isn’t necessary right now .\n\nAutopilot is not a drop-in replacement for tools like PathPlanner or Choreo. It aims to solve the same problem of autonomous robot navigation, but it does so in a different manner that isn’t suitable for every single use case. Unlike those tools, Autopilot doesn’t try to follow a pre-generated trajectory. The benefits of this have already been described, but this comes at a cost. You cannot modify a path, even if you know the initial and final state. What I mean by this is that you cannot open a GUI and modify the shape of the path. If you really need to fine-tune your paths, Autopilot is not the solution for you. However, is this really necessary? Highly successful teams like 2056 and 2910 both ran relatively simple “drive-to-point” straight-line controls this year, and 2056 boasted what I think is the most dominant auto on the planet. Autopilot only builds onto this simple base, adding more control over the end behavior of the path - as well as providing a smoother end motion profile.\n\nautopilot-path 800×800 14.1 KB\n\nautopilot-path 800×800 14.1 KB\n\nautopilot-path 800×800 14.1 KB\n\nThe above graph shows two different paths that the robot can take. Autopilot is capable of behaving in either manner, but the difference is in entry angle . When entry angle is not respected or demanded (the black dashed line), the robot should directly travel towards the target position. However, if the robot needs not only to approach the target, but also do so from a known direction, a second action is taken (the solid purple line). This is the trajectory that Autopilot gravitates towards when respecting entry angle.\n\nYou can try to experiment with Autopilot with this Desmos graph and see how Autopilot behaves. Click and drag the purple dot to change starting position, and see the trajectories generated.\n\nNote that Autopilot doesn’t actually generate these trajectories, it only calculates the current velocities required to follow that trajectory. For a more detailed, math-focused description of how Autopilot works, read this page of the Autopilot docs.\n\nTeam 3414 ran this version of Autopilot at IRI 2025, and although we had our fair share of other struggles, we didn’t need to make any modifications to our code for alignment. We saw great results. Tracking was smooth, consistent, and we only missed two coral in auto during the event (and we had the vision issue fixed after the third match (2nd miss), after which we proceeded to have 100% coral consistency throughout the rest of our autons. For the remainder of the event, we saw high consistency in alignment in teleop as well. But the best part about Autopilot vs our older solution of just a profiled PID controller (trapezoid profile) was the end behavior. Where the older solution occasionally struggled in the last part of the path, where slowing down is crucial, Autopilot’s smoother end profile gave us faster alignment speeds because we ensured we came to a smooth stop and didn’t overshoot the target.\n\nExample match: IRI Match 86 . We’re top right on red (3414).\n\nIn our off-season development of gamepiece tracking, Autopilot is being used again. Because it’s completely stateless, it’s easy to quickly navigate towards a target on the fly - even if the target is moving. We just use the estimated pose of the gamepiece on the field to navigate towards the target.\n\nThanks for reading! If this sounds like it may be of interest to you or your team, consider giving Autopilot a try! Also feel free to ask questions about Autopilot that I may not have covered!\n\nTo see the code, view Autopilot’s Github . Currently, this project is Java-only.\n\nFor more information about installation, code use, and the technicalities of Autopilot, read the documentation .",

It doesn’t return a rotational speed - only a setpoint.\n\nThe reason for this is because Autopilot is mainly about the translation bit of the path, so it leaves the rotation bit up to the user. If it was included, it would just be an internal profiled PID controller which the user would have to supply anyways, so best leave it out.\n\nBut if you’re asking if the setpoint is just the target, yeah. I’ve considered adding a rotation interpolation or whatever, but I don’t know if that’s super helpful (but let me know if you think it would be).",

These are all respected, if possible, but the robot’s motion will slow down as it rotates. However, the shape of the path should be unaffected. The direction the robot travels in won’t change - although it will have to slow down to follow it and turn.\n\nlevyishai:\n\nwhich affects the constraints\n\nNot really.

Excited to try this out in the fall.\n\nWe used a “DriveToPose” pretty well this year throughout Auto and Teleop to lineup to nodes. It was just profiled pid controllers on each of the dimensions and rotation.\n\nFrom watching our videos, it isn’t bad but we seem to come to a sudden stop in some cases.

(Really, we ran it faster but we missed more so it was effectively slower.) The other main reason that these autos missed so much was because we hadn’t yet introduced any sort of demand for entry angle. Therefore, when we overshot (which was often), we did so in an unpredictable direction. We could be coming in “sideways” to the target with respect to the reef, so instead of stopping at the branch, we’d go too far to the left/right.\n\nHowever, with Autopilot, we can ensure that our end direction of motion is always towards the reef, which means that if we overshoot (which isn’t even really a problem anymore), we only push into the reef, which is much more tolerant of error because we’re still lined up with the branch.\n\njoemost:\n\nIt’d be cool to see the difference in your paths plotted vs that sleek auto linked above.\n\nThe old solution utilized PathPlanner for most of the motion, but then used a simple beeline controller (drives straight towards target) with a trapezoidal profile to do the final alignment. Here’s a screenshot of what the path looked like in PathPlanner:\n\nleft3 878×403 45.8 KB\n\nleft3 878×403 45.8 KB\n\nleft3 878×403 45.8 KB\n\nThe parts where it’s close to the reef or HP station are where we would switch to a simple beeline controller.",

The library is really very simple (as I’m sure you noticed - really just 4 files) so I figured it would be relatively quick to port - I just don’t have the time to learn C++. I’ll  put a link to it in the docs where the warning is to let users know there’s a C++ option now. In the future, I think it would be possible to merge your project into the “official” repo but I don’t know how that would work with jitpack (which is only for Java). I really appreciate you taking the time to do this!\n\nUpdate: the link is now on the website’s home page. Thanks a ton!",

Is the F=ma too theoretical on the forces the robot experiences? What does the decreasing force do for the smoothness? Is it actually for a faster initial braking and only letting off when you get really close?\n\nIve done a little digging and there’s some pages that say constant jerk is good in robotics but not really why. I am wondering if you can explain it from your experience here.",
