Is there a way to better load Balance?",

I would not think this is expected behavior – if the motors are mechanically tied together I would expect to see only minor variations in current draw between them (within measurement error probably). Steps to debug:\n\nDo you see identical behavior on both sides, or is it only on one side? If it’s only one side it may have something to do with wiring (bad connection on the one that is pulling more current).\n\nDo you see identical behavior on both sides, or is it only on one side?

Unplug two of the motors for each gearbox and see how it drives (not aggressively, just to see which direction it goes) c.

With out removing the bot code then using Phoenix Tuner commamded motor 1 (leader)  all motors flash green. Wheel spin forward , Commanded motor 2 flash green spins forward SLOW. I suspect it’s is because the robot code is also trying to command a zero speed *motor 1, Commanded motor 3  same as 2\n\nOther side is the same. So phase seems inline and mechanicaly coupled.\n\nFur the question if both sides appear to have similar results. YES\n\nOn stilts M1 peeks 90amp, M2 peeks 20, M3 peeks 30.\n\nI know there is much to try yet. Probably first going to try amd remove all follower code and command each individually with the same Controlmode.Velocity, setpoint.\n\nSo there is a question what do the followers follow? The master is running in velocity mode with just a feed forward configured.  The followers do not have any pidf. I was to believe the followers follow using percent output of the leader.\n\n@marshall master/slave are the terms I commonly see with my Rockwell Automation Motion Control Systems.",
