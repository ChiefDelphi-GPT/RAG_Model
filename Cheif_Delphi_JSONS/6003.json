Given the spec sheets, requirements for operation, and the reasons for switching, (I think) we can expect some exciting new changes to rules, specifically regarding wireless connectivity at competition. Thanks to the change to the 6Ghz band, we may be finally allowed to use (non 6ghz) wireless connections at competition, finally alleviating a major headache of teams and spectators. Given the official use case listed for “practicing at home” we may be able to connect wirelessly at the practice field, which frees up space for teams practicing to move around each other, gives teams more freedom of motion when testing, and generally alleviates the headaches resulting from a tangled or caught tether cable.\n\nIf you have any more official documentation, or insider info on potential rule changes, feel free to share!",

But I fear that if we move to wireless practice teams will be more careless and more people will get hurt. Teams may do a decent job of being cognizant of when their robot is about to move, but I have seen too many times where people aren’t aware of what other robots around them are about to do (whether it’s because they aren’t paying attention or because other robots are less predictable).\n\nIf wireless practice comes alongside more space limitations (no one can be within X feet of a robot and it’s intended path when it’s being tested), and greater supervision, then maybe this is something that would improve safety and team experiences. But I don’t think we can or should drop wireless practice into the same experience we have done in the past.",

Though I cant quite make out if they were spare fields setup for practice matches, or wireless fields for testing auto.\n\n(Context) I was one of the practice field FTAs this year at Champs.\n\nThere were two full-size fields on either end of the FRC floor (so 4 in total).\n\nOne was dedicated to tether practice, 4 teams on the field at a time for 10 minutes. No restrictions on what you can test, it was predominantly used for auto testing but I saw some of everything.\n\nThe other was dedicated to playing practice matches like you would on a real field (minus refs and real scoring), with teams getting two matches back to back with a few minutes to reset in between.\n\nSeparate from that there were wooden practice elements like you would see at regional event (6 sets per side I want to say?) and two full-size, field-quality stages to practice tethered climbs and traps.\n\nIf we keep a tethered field, I think mandating longer ethernets and no one within several feet of a robot and it’s intended path is the only way to go. There were multiple injuries and near-misses on the tethered fields, and something needs to change. I don’t believe wireless practice (short of moving to a system where no one is on the field while robots are running) is the right direction regardless of wooden fields or full fields, even though it’s supported by the new radios.",

I feel like one of the biggest problems is the lack of safety requirements on the practice field. One thing that may be a big help is having for example a plywood ’ table ’ that can be used as a driver station to create a mental barrier between the field and the driver (safe) side. This along with perhaps a small plywood barrier even if it’s just a few 2x4s, or taped off safety zone would help to ensure safety. I feel most team members wander around the practice field a bit too much without regard for the robots. Surprisingly, I noticed a drastic drop in awareness around robots at competition compared to practicing at home. Not sure if it’s just the stress of competition, or perhaps the lack of a defined danger zone, but something needs to change. I’m sure you’ve also seen some of the things teams get away with on the practice field without repercussion that would be an immediate e-stop on an actual field. Things like running full speed toward an individual, with or without a barrier to stop them come to mind.",

Now that the fields will be 6 GHz, and mobile phones aren’t allowed to use this band for hotspots, it would be great if hotspots were explicitly allowed in the stands.\n\nSpecifically, even for a simple scouting app based on a google form (which is a fairly easy thing even for low resource teams), students need data to be able to access this from their phones.  This has been a concern as a majority of our student scouters don’t have data.  A simple solution would be for one team member with data to offer a team hotspot, and then the other scouters can submit results through that.  This is by far the simplest and most cost effective solution we can come up with.",

Simple changes like only 3 people on the practice field at a time, only one person interacting with the robot, no-one on the field when autonomous is being tested, even small changes like a few 2x4s lined up as a ‘barrier’ of sorts would help to mentally separate the danger zone from the safe zone.\n\nTethering, as it stands, is not the solution however. Another option to avoid swapping radios or reconfiguring could be a second radio running in bridge mode permenantly linked to a ‘driver station’ radio kept by the volunteer running the field. Using this, teams could connect wirelessly simply by hooking the secondary radio into their robot radio and enabling POE to deliver power to the field’s robot radio.",
