Then stops doing so after the next reboot and will not work again until I restart the install from scratch. And it will not show every time.\n\nManually starting Photon Vision generates several errors in the log including: Couldn’t load shared object photonlibcamera At this point, I am pretty sure this is my immediate issue. Could not deserialize apriltag layout! Could not connect to the robot! Failed to create or connect to Pigpio Daemon socket: Connection refused Exception while setting DHCP!\n\nCouldn’t load shared object photonlibcamera At this point, I am pretty sure this is my immediate issue.\n\nAt this point, I am pretty sure this is my immediate issue.\n\nCould not deserialize apriltag layout!\n\nCould not connect to the robot!\n\nFailed to create or connect to Pigpio Daemon socket: Connection refused\n\nException while setting DHCP!\n\nYour mission, if you choose to accept, is to help me figure out what I am doing wrong.",

Each time leads to a final step of rebooting the Romi, seeing the WPILibPi Portal come up as expected and the Photon Vision Portal come up but not recognize the camera. Sometimes, intermediate steps do recognize the camera but then “loose” it on subsequent reboots. Here is my process.\n\nGetting Started with Romi\n\nGetting Started with Romi — FIRST Robotics Competition documentation\n\nI really liked these instructions, they were well written and clear.\n\nSubsteps that were all successfully performed: Download WPILibPi_64_image-v2023.2.1-Romi.zip for the image. In previous attempts I used the 32 Bit version. That choice does not to appear to impact behavior Flash SD Update Firmware IMU Calibration Attach Life Cam and Rename Update SSID\n\nDownload WPILibPi_64_image-v2023.2.1-Romi.zip for the image.

Also, at this point the Photon Client is also up and running. And here is my issue.\n\nThere is no recognized camera.\n\nSo, I disabled the service and rebooted. The Photon Client did not come up as expected. I then ran:\n\n/usr/bin/java -jar /opt/photonvision/photonvision.jar\n\nSo I could see the logs. The logs are below, but the first line is:\n\n[2024-01-28 13:26:29] [Camera - LibCameraJNILoader] [ERROR] Couldn't load shared object photonlibcamera: /tmp/libphotonlibcamera.so: libcamera.so.0.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\nI cannot find any documentation on photonlibcamera , but suspect this is what would load the camera.\n\nSo, this is where I am stuck.\n\nAny suggestions?",

                    "cooked": "Reopening this old thread, since not much development has happened on Romi side, and the problems described here are still happening. I do see people refer to this thread in various forums (e.g., on the FRC Discord channel), so it looks like other people (like myself) are still trying to make this work.\n\nSo, after stumbling upon all the errors described here, and with the hint from loafdog’s last message + a little bit of info in the most current Photovision installation page ( Romi Installation - PhotonVision Docs ), it looks like the trick is to install a 2023.4.2 version of photonvision. I’m copying here the info I compiled responding to a question in the FRC Discord channel:\n\nWhen I run sudo ./install.sh -v 2023.4.2 it was failing with this error:\n\nWhen I run ./install --list-versions it will indeed list versions only ranging back to some time mid 2024. But last night I managed to work around that and now I finally have photon vision working on the Romi. I’m adding notes how that worked out in case anyone else stumbles upon this:\n\nRomi is imaged with WPILib version from with “_Romi” in the image name (the last, AFAICT) as per instructions here Imaging your Romi — FIRST Robotics Competition documentation\n\nI’ve went through hoops and loops to enable the Bridge mode, since that seemed broken as well. DM me if you want my messy notes on this\n\nI then got to installing the PhotonVision script, starting with downloading the script (while SSH-ed in the Romi’s PI):\n\nHere, before running the install script, I went in with sudo nano install.sh and commented out the following two lines. This is so it actually just downloads the real_install.sh and not delete it on the spot:\n\nFinally, I went into the real_install.sh with sudo nano real_install.sh and commented out the lines (l286-l289) that check for the existance of the old package:\n\nFIRST Robotics Competition Documentation\n\nImaging your Romi\n\nThe Romi has 2 microprocessor boards: A Raspberry Pi that handles high-level communication with the robot program running on the desktop and, A Romi 32U4 Control Board that handles low-level motor …\n\nSo now running sudo ./install.sh -v 2023.4.2 again, skips the version check and happily installs the old version. Few more reboots and sudo systemctl restart photonvision.service later, the service finally came to life!! NOTE: The service takes the liberty to rename the hostname of the pi, so it is not accessible as http://wpilibpi.local or any custom hostname you might have had for it but with http://photonvision/",
