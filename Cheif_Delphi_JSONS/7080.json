                    "cooked": "We had a problem at PNW Sammamish Competition this weekend that makes no sense to any mentor or member of the team. Between matches, with no code changes, our previously reliable odometry failed in a very crazy way, it looked almost like it was giving random positions on the field. After the match, we took the robot back to our pits and ran some tests using apriltag images to test to see where it would go, and it seemed to go to the right positions. Just to be extra sure, we took it to the practice field to test out vision. We encountered no errors with the odometry, so we assumed it was a onetime issue. Next match, same issue, the odometry was flipping out again, teleporting to almost random positions and even jumping off the field, which is weird because we have code that discards vision inputs if they are out of the field boundaries. This match though, our drive coach recorded the match so we could review it after. In the video, any time we did not have an apriltag in our camera’s sights, it would run just fine using mechanical odometry, so we assume it is probably something with our visual odometry. This issue kept up for the rest of the competition even through elims, with the error unrepeatable outside of actual matches. After the competition, we took the robot back to our field and ran a full run through of a competition from autos to teleop and didn’t see the issue. The next day we ran through as many things we could think of to replicate the issue with no avail, such as maxing out robot cpu to force loop overruns or messing with photonvision settings on our cameras to get a similar result. We have run out of both ideas and theories of what happened and if it will continue to happen at future competitions. Right now, we are testing faking bad mechanical odometry for our robot or trying to show it multiple wrong or the same apriltags on a single camera. If anyone has had a similar issue, please reach out to us.\n\nBad Odometry Video\n\nGood Odometry Video",

I’d expect that if there was a field-related issue, we would have seen it the first day, and other teams running Photon Vision would have seen it as well.\n\nThe other thing that stands out to me is how fast the poses are changing, which suggests that we’re feeding in data with very low uncertainty. We’re scaling our standard deviation for each measurement linearly with distance to the target and I’m not sure what failure mode would give us a valid target with a very small distance. With the way we’re calculating it, there’s no way for the uncertainty to go negative, and feeding in a NaN causes the whole filter to break and lock us at the origin.\n\nThere’s a chance we may have been getting bad drivebase odometry data, which the original post mentions that we’re going to test next, but it seems odd that the robot would move much at all if there was a problem there. The steering encoders seem like they were fine because we were able to drive the robot without field-relative orientation adjustments, the drive encoders must be fine because they’re brushless motors and they still moved, and I’m not sure a gyro outage tracks with the variety of different positions the pose estimator was hitting.\n\nIf we can’t get a solution here, I think advice on how to log raw odometry data to disk without choking our CPU would also help so we can get some real data (instead of me trying to point my phone at a screen while also playing a match). We have a screen recorder on our driver station now, but getting real numbers that we can plot would be better. We’re a little too late in the season to figure out AdvantageKit integration now.",

At our event in NC this past Sunday, we had issues with tags on the red side but not the blue. There were windows at the red end and it was a sunny day. Late in the afternoon (in time for finals when we were red) it cleared up. We do not recall having the issue Saturday when there were more clouds. We think it might have been the sunlight but we have not been able to prove it.\n\nI took a look at the weather this past weekend in Bellevue, WA and it appears that there was much more sunshine on Sunday as compared to Saturday. If this is true and your pit and the practice field are shaded, this might be issue.",
