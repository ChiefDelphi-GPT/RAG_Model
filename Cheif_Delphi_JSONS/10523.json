The idea was that I wanted to build something that could be constructed quickly and require 0 manufacturing resources while being competitive.\n\nIs this the most competitive robot you can build? Probably not. Is it the most optimal way to do it? Yeah no. I just wanted to see how far you can go without manufacturing anything and build an entire robot doing that while only taking a few hours to design the whole thing.\n\nI priced it out with a friend, and it was under four thousand dollars (with electronics not including stuff in the KOP), which is a lot, but considering there’s swerve and electronics are expensive, that’s good enough for me.\n\nConstraints:\n\nAs little manufacturing or precision work as possible. The only thing you need to do is cut tubes and shaft to length. (which hopefully is possible)\n\n0 tapping\n\nUsing laser cutting/2d cnc resources is allowed, fabworks and scs are used\n\nAs much stuff from 1 COTS supplier as possible. (like 95 percent rev) image 917×671 94.2 KB\n\nimage 917×671 94.2 KB\n\nimage 917×671 94.2 KB\n\nDrilling basically doesn’t exist. if you need some level of precision, use a laser-cutting service.\n\n1 Part studio, 1 Assembly for the entire robot (for fun)\n\nThe polycarbonate + aluminum plates are bought, I could have used a box tube system instead of the large 1/4 plate, but I didn’t think it would be pretty and it would require some amount of drilling into the tube/adding extra plates to support it and make it strong, which would be kind of redundant.\n\nThe driving shaft is coupled using the two max planetaries, so you don’t need to tap the shaft.\n\nAll other shafts are retained using shaft collars.\n\nI couldn’t bother with belt cc distances, but you could probably buy all the belts you needed from vbelt guys for an extra 20-30 dollars or so.\n\nFasteners are not cadded because I want to go to read before I go to bed.\n\nUsing maxtube for the intake allows for pre-cut configurations of 7 and 15, which decreases the manufacturing time and need for precision. It was a first for me to use this tube, so it was a little bit awkward at first to figure out how to design with it and make it work.\n\nInspired heavily by team 1561, thanks for the inspiration!",

They replaced the shaft with a steel one to counteract this issue, but I think putting the pivot point lower would be better.\n\nI’m kind of worried about the impact resistance of your front plate.",

During a build season, I think it’s worth doing a custom plate and ordering it to simplify manufacturing, especially if the COTS solution is overbuilt or has a high part count. I bet teams could find a manufacturing sponsor for plate or ask local teams too.\n\nLast season, I had Fabworks basically laser all of our 1/8 plate even if we had an omio, just because it reduced the amount of machining error by a lot and freed up our machining by a good amount.\n\nFor the belly pan, I’ll be happy to let a service take care of it lol. Making a belly pan by hand takes up a ton of student hours and it can get frustrating (but it’s possible!).\n\nI bet REV knows of a better way of running my design without the custom plate, but I’m happy with the first attempt that I made for fun on a whim.",

Designing a robot that can be manufactured by “only” a hacksaw, and then including parts that have to be outsourced to laser cutting and machine shop services seems rather counter-intuitive. It doesn’t really fit the low-budget/low-resource model at that point. And, as with the example you provided, similar concepts can be executed in-house without using machining resources that low-resource teams would likely have access to (cordless drills).",
