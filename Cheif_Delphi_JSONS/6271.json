It is a QR code scanner that stores the data in an offline database. You (the scouting “manager”) sit in the stands with your laptop application as your scouts bring you QR codes. That data can be exported to Excel or whatever analytics software you use.\n\nmain\n\nSonic Scout is scouting software for First Robotics competitions. - diskuv/scoutapps\n\nNew in this 2024.07.29 release:\n\nThe Android app and Windows application have been prebuilt. Just download them to try them out.\n\nA single script to do “development” (you do source code modifications, it does download, installation, building of apps and launching of the QR scanner and Android Studio)\n\nYou will need your team mentor to start any development. The programming languages are Java and OCaml . (Mentors can contact me directly.)\n\nEnjoy, Jonah",

A school provided laptop is rarely sufficient. It is better to check prerequisites earlier.\n\nPart of my mentees’ motivation was the love of robotics and competition, and getting familiar with what life could be after high school. And part of the motivation was having something unique and directly relevant to college to put on their college applications . That is where OCaml helps, since it will be familiar to most professors in CS departments and (from my limited dataset) looked favorably compared to the conventional pure Java/Python applicant. So as the school year starts, if you have strong students who don’t want to do robotics since “everybody” does it (etc.), this is your selling point.\n\nMost students will need some training with OCaml . My training is a dramatically reduced form of Cornell’s CS3110 YouTube series … just enough that students can understand and hack the code.\n\nHere’s the thing … I can do the prerequisites check and the training! But: 1) A mentor needs to be present for obvious reasons and 2) The more people who want training the easier it is for me to justify hosting it.\n\nAll the best, Jonah",
