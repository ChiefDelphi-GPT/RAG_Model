                    "cooked": "Hi CD , About a year ago our team experimented with using vex limit switches (we have plenty from our school’s engineering department). However sketchy, those trigger switches worked quite well on our offseason bot for detecting cubes, so well in fact, that we decided it would be a good idea to use vex bumper switches to detect the note in our pivoting intake this past 2024 season. However, those switches have caused nothing but problems for us. At our first qualifier, we had one bumper limit switch. It kinda worked but not well. We did have to replace it a few times as it broke a lot. Between our qualifiers, we thought that it would be a good idea to increase the number of bumper limit switches from 1 to 3 in the hope that a broken limit switch would not make intaking hard, and to be sure that the note would hit the vex bumper limit switch. This turned out to be a problematic solution. The vex limit switches did break (we expected them to) but when they broke, they often defaulted to the triggered position. TLDR: the intake thinks there is a note when there isn’t and thus won’t actually intake. I’m pretty sure we ended up quickly coding a manual override, but even so, our autos were often screwed for that second qualifier, and many close “winnable” matches we failed to win because of this problem. We switched to a different limit switch not from vex for the DCMP , which worked quite well. We now are investing in other systems like break beams and photoelectric sensors going forward, along with the better limit switches.\n\nOther teams may have had more luck with these switches, but from our expierence, it would probably be a good idea to invest in the more expensive, but probably better option if your team can do so.\n\nCD , what has your experience been?",

I’m assuming these are the same bumper switches you are talking about and I did not like them back then either.\n\nTheir intended use case is to attach them to a chassis on the outside and use it for collision detection. Vex EDR bots were pretty slow so they survived some hits, but when we tried them in FTC they snapped on the first wall. The plastic felt cheap and easy to get stuck.\n\nhttps://www.vexrobotics.com/276-2159.html\n\nAs others have said besides the cheap quality of these sensors, there’s other reasons to find someone else",

They aren’t super common in industry, unless you have a really low impact failure mode if you lose it.\n\nA typical method for failsafing a sensor is to use a 3-wire switch that has both a normally open and normally closed output. The outputs would be wired into two different DIO slots. Normally a single one is true and the other is false, and then when the switch is triggered they change places. A cut wire (both open) and shorted wire (both closed) condition can be inferred if the two DIO are not inverse of each other.",
