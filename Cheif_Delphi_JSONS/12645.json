Our team is using a Raspberry Pi 4b+. Other posts state that:\n\nribbon cable is faster than USB\n\nOV9281 is probably the best recommended for PhotonVision\n\nTherefore we purchased a the Innomaker OV9281 ribbon cable camera ( here ) , and the latency is over 80 ms on our pi 4b+ with 4GB RAM because there are limited options for resolutions. We didn’t realize at the time the lack of resolution options. We have to use 1280x800 at 60 FPS as that is the only option high enough to use 3d in PV. The rest are 640x480 or 320x240. Obviously this latency is too great.\n\nWould someone be willing to share the link to the specific camera to use that works well with a pi and PV? We have seen that another team using the Arducam OV9281 USB version ( here ). Is this what works best? Is there not a version of the OV9281 that is a ribbon-cable and has the correct resolution options?",

All the latency numbers we have seen people posting are smaller than what we are seeing (sometimes much smaller), which led us to believe that we need to get our numbers down to be useful. We are a lower-resourced team and don’t yet have all our parts to make a drivetrain functional enough to do more testing on our own. Also our practice space is a narrow hallway, and we likely won’t be on a field or anything close to even a half-field until our first competition. It will be difficult for us to see if our system is going to really work until our first competition. We are trying to “learn from the best” by following what others are doing. It is very helpful for us to see other teams will have latencies around 300ms as now we know our assumption was wrong and may be fine for our use.",

This is the simple strategy, and one Limelight helped push forward big time a few years back. It’s still the easiest way to get started. 80ms is right on that threshold of “probably negligible” - your code runs every 20ms, so that’s only like 3-4 loops behind. 150-200 is where you’d probably start to see bigger issues. Specifically, the most common symptom is not being able to tune your drivetrain PID gains very high before oscillation occurs.\n\nThe hardware way (that I’m referring to, and which is detailed in the 254 paper) is to remember a short history of where your robot has been for the past second or so. Then, when a vision measurement comes in with some latency, go back in that buffer of history to correct the point at which the vision measurement came in, and “replay” the samples after that with the adjustment. The latest in the buffer is still what you use for controlling the robot’s drivetrain.\n\nThe jury is still out on whether apriltags can be processed fast enough to use the old “ignore-latency” method. Certainly lowering resolution and increasing decimation helps (to the point where you can see ~60-80ms latencies on photonvision even on older Pi’s). However, what I honestly don’t know is whether with the speed optimizations, the accuracy at distance is still good enough to be useful on a real field. I sure hope it is, but I’m not yet hanging my hat on that being for-sure-true.",

We have been reading all the theory behind using vision and generally understand it, but as first-timers with vision and limitations on the size of our practice space for testing it is hard to know what the line is between acceptable latency and where more complex code needs to be written to correct for it.\n\ngerthworm:\n\nSpecifically, the most common symptom is not being able to tune your drivetrain PID gains very high before oscillation occurs.\n\nAt this point we aren’t planning to use PID on our drivetrain to align on a target as we are using a differential drive, which limits our maneuverability. Rather we plan/hope to use PoseEstimation  with PV to auto-drive to certain targets within the Community. We hope that our updates to the Pose with the AprilTag info will be accurate enough to allow us to do this.",
