Understanding your rationale might help someone better tailor a response.  If you “standardized” on CTRE , would you forego using a Power Distribution Hub from Rev, the current FRC -selected supplier of core control components?  If you “standardized” on Rev, would you forego using a CANcoder on a swerve module?\n\nTatiman-Dev:\n\nMech stuff, etc\n\nNote that CTRE is an electronics supplier.   They don’t have “mech stuff”.  If you standardized on CTRE , but wanted a great planetary gearbox, would you forego using the MAXPlanetary?\n\nMaybe the essence of your question is Kraken vs Vortex?",

                    "cooked": "Oh god, this thread might devolve basically into a religious debate\n\nWe’ve had a lot of great experiences with CTRE , even just this past weekend on a Saturday evening we called them for help with some software and other troubleshooting and they were absolutely amazing.\n\nI don’t have nearly as many experiences with Rev, but their email service has been excellent.\n\nHowever we have felt that from a software perspective we prefer to work with CTRE and their features. We’ve also been getting deeper into the WCP ecosystem and are looking forward to seeing more WCP and CTRE integration in terms of products. I have also had the impression from my own team and teams we work closely with that CTRE sensors have been easier for their students to work with and troubleshoot than some Rev sensors.\n\nDisclaimer: 177 is sponsored by WCP which is affiliated with CTRE .\n\nFor mechanical components we have mostly WCP and Thriftybot, with some Rev components sprinkled in.\n\nJust like everything in life, variety is a good thing. You can try to standardize some places, but often time a mix of vendors here and there gets you to great solutions. For example our motors are CTRE , but some mechanical components mix in Rev with a large chunk being WCP , TTB , and others.\n\nEdit: I do want to mention something CTRE did that I love and have actually used - Tuner X is available as an Android application. I was able to connect to our robot a few days ago after using my cell service to pull firmware onto my application, and then was able to connect to our robot to check firmware on robot devices, all from my phone.\n\nIt sounds like something easy - but the fact that I didn’t know this was something I wanted but loved having was really nice. It can come in very handy in places where you may not have wifi and using your phone might be much quicker.",

We have had numerous with REV products.\n\nCTRE ’s software is amazing and miles ahead of REV’s, also.\n\nBy the end of 2023 I was starting to get a little fed up with REV’s lack of software support but personally, REV’s QC issues and the fact that their already lacking (in some ways) software is also more buggy than CTRE ’s was the final nail in the coffin for me. I do prefer the REV PDH and many REV products that do not require being programmed but as far as programming and electrical goes, CTRE ’s products just seem to work more and work better.\n\nI have nothing fundamental against REV, I just wish they would step their software game up a lot.\n\nI will also say, neither company is perfect. We have lost multiple matches due to inadequate documentation and faulty reporting of “fixed bugs” on products from both vendors (some actually just this last weekend ).",

                    "cooked": "I am going to preface this with the statement that I love both companies and think they’re both doing a great job however each have their own downfalls.\n\nFirst I am going to explain the software perspective.\n\nI loveee CTRE ’s software and how they allow advanced PID utilization through their compounding FeedForwards and motion profiling, BUT all of this comes at a steeper price (understandably bc more dev time was needed to make this). REV is great and cheaper but it’s integrated capabilities are sorely behind TalonFX capabilities, while keeping their prices down (good!) they have been neglecting some developer time to continuously improve their library to integrate advanced common functionalities that their products may be used for.\n\nWith that said, everything you can do with CTRE Hardware can be done with REV hardware, however it may be slower due to the root commands being sent from a robot program with WPILib classes which require a more intimate understanding and operates in 20ms loops at best, whereas it can be done with only initial configuration and handled in dedicated loops like CTRE libraries do.\n\nCTRE Libraries work well with all logging aspects and even enables logging of every packet sent to maximize debugging capabilities of teams, there is 3rd party effort through Mechanical Advantages URCL vendordep which recreates this, however it is not REV native again.\n\nREV hardware has a nasty issue where configurations are disregarded in rare occasions and when fetching data from REV devices the error handling and verbosity is lackluster in comparison to CTRE ’s implementation of a global wrapper for all fetched CAN data.\n\nNow for hardware wise.\n\nREV has had a few mistakes this year in the rollout of the SparkFlex and NEO vortex, however this is their first season of availability and we wish these issues were caught sooner that didn’t happen.\n\nMore importantly than the issue’s themselves is REV’s response to them proves they are a company which will not make it complicated, or fault users who have been interrupted by this manufacturing issue. They issued the first recall i can remember in FRC history and handled all returns and replacements swiftly and responsibly to do right by their customers even if it hurt their bottom line. This is worth noting particularly because we have seen issues like the ones REV had and not seen a response for weeks or months and when it did come out it was “buy more” (which you can’t fault CTRE for, infact CTRE will do RMA’s just like REV and send replacements) not “send it back and we’ll replace it”.\n\nAs for application on a robot the build teams can work well with either and both have equal capabilities in that regard.\n\nAnother thing to note is that CTRE supports newer CAN protocols and a secondary CAN bus through their canivore which reduces utilization on congested CAN networks. REV has yet to introduce the same product.\n\nNow for the big one, accurate reporting…\n\nSparkMAX’s and SparkFlex’s dampen the readings to filter out noise at the cost of accuracy, too high of a cost at times. The issue can be mitigated by alternative hardware but shouldn’t need to be. This may be an area where a revised motor line could be introduced.\n\nSupport wise.\n\nCTRE ’s team is much more active in nontraditional forms of customer support such as the unofficial FRC Discord, and ChiefDelphi. REV is present in both but not to the same degree, however their email support is second to none and will correct issues anyone brings up with them, they will route your problems to the correct people and i highly suspect the reason they don’t have as many convenience features as CTRE ’s library is their lack of presence of these platforms and initiative to address common problems with elegant library or future hardware solutions.\n\nHowever at this point it is important to keep in mind REV is not only invested in serving FRC but FTC as well, so nontraditional support would be extremely difficult for both programs.\n\nI would also like to point out CTRE is actively supporting non- FRC outlets in industrial settings, something REV may or may not be intentionally doing as well to a smaller scale.\n\nNow onto the most controversial part.\n\nPhoenix Pro; when it came out it was decried as it locked promised features ( FOC ) behind the license. Since it’s launch CTRE has proven they are not squandering the funds generated from Phoenix Pro and instead reinvested it to improve and recreate from the ground up a conscious highly optimized, and maintainable, user-centric API which can be used for years to come by all teams, Phoenix 6 and it’s associated application Tuner X.\n\nREV may release the same but if they do and don’t have the return in which CTRE has clearly provided for all customers it may be viewed as a useless cash grab, as CTRE ’s initial rollout was.\n\nAs stated before, both companies are amazing and using their resources very differently. It is entirely up to resources and team choices on which to purchase from.",
