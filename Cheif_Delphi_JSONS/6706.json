                    "cooked": "Whatever you choose, get something with haptics . I can’t recommend them enough. Haptics (a.k.a. rumble) are one of the best ways to quickly signal something to your driver. They’re even better than LEDs because they don’t require a sight line, and once you start using haptics you’ll never go back. We used them on our robot to signal when we had a note in our intake and when the flywheels were up to speed, and it made a significant impact on our cycle times.\n\nWe use Xbox One controllers because they’re reliable, easily replaceable, and have haptics for a pretty good price point. They go on sale frequently as well — for example, you can get them for half off on Black Friday. As a first-party controller they have a nice build quality and feel great to use. Plus, they’re natively supported by Windows, allowing your programming team to become the pro gaming team as soon as the robot breaks.\n\nIf you’re trying to decide between an Xbox controller and an Logitech controller, I’d advise against the Logitech controller. While I’ve heard they’re decently reliable and they’re dirt cheap, the lack of haptics and middling build quality are deal breakers for me. Keep in mind though that this advice is coming from someone who thinks that the Logitech controllers look and feel like Happy Meal toys and would much rather spend a week figuring out how to get a Wiimote to work than spend an hour holding a Logitech controller.\n\nIf you’re in the market for something high-end, I’d look for a controller with Hall-effect sensors in the joysticks (as they’re super accurate and almost impossible to wear down), extra buttons, or with snapback capacitors to increase accuracy with fast movements. I haven’t done a ton of research in this area though so I can’t recommend anything specific.",
