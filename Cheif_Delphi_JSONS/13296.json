I will try my best to answer anything and any reason we may have done something a certain way. Also if we are doing something a weird way, feel free to point it out, it’s still a learning process for the students and myself.\n\nFor STL area teams I am really hoping to have some programming workshops this fall once we get new recruitment when school is back in session so please reach out if you are interested in joining those.",

Because of this the ty() angle in it’s raw form gives a pretty bad distance value. This is easy to see if you move rotate your robot/turret in the yaw axis and look at the limelight image. You’ll see that the center of the goal moves up as you go either to the left on right. Making the ty() angle appear as if the robot is closer. So we did a quick and dirty and divide the tx() angle in degrees by 12 and reduce it, we call it our yaw correction factor.\n\nIm pretty sure there’s a better way to do this but this worked pretty well. We use the vision constantly (every single loop) to solve for robot x,y so we can use the pose and velocities to position a “virtual goal” for move and shoot. So It was really important that we could do this while moving even tangentially when the target is by the edge of the image. This allows us to successfully move and shoot approaching top speed when behind the “ball circle”.",

If you left it at say 2.00s then the robot may rotate the swerve modules with a really small command to rotate but never get there. Probably does not matter much but we didn’t want to robot to continue to keep trying to get to the angle when stationary, so whatever correction it can get in that last .25s was good enough, next year we are going to revisit this as I think there may be better solutions",
