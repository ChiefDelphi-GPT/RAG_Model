We sourced parts from CNC routers, lasered AL parts suppliers, and manufacturers. We prioritized ease of tuning and relied on auto-scoring for the Reef.\n\nThe robot evolved from a basic design, incorporating key features like a珊瑚/algae end effector for impact resistance. We learned valuable lessons about shaft measurement and encoder placement, enhancing our build process.\n\nThis year, we emphasized pre-designing components such as the chassis, elevator, and end effector, drawing inspiration from previous designs and current trends. We adapted strategies to avoid certain challenges, such as avoiding a climber to save weight and time.\n\nThe CAD assembly, labeled \"Master,\" aimed to integrate a ground coral intake but was delayed due to time constraints. The implemented system proved effective despite delays.\n\nThroughout the season, our focus shifted to improving the codebase, particularly in vision systems and driver aids. The Coral/Algae end effector underwent subtle revisions for enhanced performance.\n\nOff-season projects include expanding the robot's capabilities and preparing for multi-camera localization. The naming decision was influenced by the design's resemblance to a stingray's tail barbs, reflecting the team's creative input.\n\nIn summary, the StingRay represents our dedication, innovation, and teamwork.",

Then assignments dropped, and we were assigned to Archimedes. Great! Nice round up there. Then we got the schedule, and StatBotics posted their Strength of Schedule stats. Cue tiny violins... 0.87 – We had the third hardest schedule! So that plan went out the window. \n\nSo we just played our game and had fun. We still had nice scores, and our EPA was around where we were for DCMP. Reliable, no real mistakes, playing well with others, enjoying the circus, team meals, etc. \n\nDraft time came up, and at best, we were hoping for a late second or third pick. Getting to the top of the draft and the second-to-last spot with Miss Daisy 341 (a Hall of Fame team) picked us up! Wooo Hooo! So what if we were the spare bot?!? We had a great time hanging out. We helped out 4270-Crusaders with some spares and some tools. We watched the high-end play from ring side, etc.",
