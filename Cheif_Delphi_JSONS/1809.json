Like last year , we’re going to structure feedback as looking for the good, the bad, and the ugly:\n\nThe good : What worked well? What did you find particularly beneficial to your team? What would you like to see more of?\n\nThe bad : What didn’t work? What did you struggle with? What would you like to see changed?\n\nThe ugly : What did you have to hack around to make it work for you? What made figuring out the right solution more difficult for you (e.g. wasted precious time)?\n\nWe’ll be using this feedback to evaluate priorities during the upcoming offseason. Any feedback is valuable – if we don’t know about, it we can’t fix it! I’ll again note that as PhotonVision is an open-source community project run by students, alumni, and working professionals in their free time, the best way to see a feature get implemented is to implement it yourself, or get someone in the community interested in implementing it. We welcome both ideas and contributors!\n\nThe most permanent way to make sure a particular issue doesn’t get lost in the noise is to open a GitHub issue ticket – we’ll be triaging these as we move into the offseason.\n\nWe’re also interested in the cameras and and coprocessors you’re using.  We would appreciate if you can fill out the survey below, so that we can identify areas of focus for the offseason.\n\nThis Form is private\n\nEdit: For those interested, here’s a spreadsheet of all the responses for data analysis.",

Basic integration and getting from 0 to 1 was straightforward enough that it was working in the first lab session (2-3 hours after school) entirely by two students.\n\nBad: We had intermittent troubles with cameras not connecting. We never really got to the bottom of this because it wasn’t frequent enough and we only really started relying on vision in our last event.\n\nBad/could be improved : We had one camera tilted up 10° to give us a better view of the loading station tag. We really struggled with “what should the translation matrix to apply to get the Pose be?” This was mostly on us, but could be aided by sample code and a web page that walked through how to convert one pose to another for an angled camera.\n\nCould be improved : Also on us, but we struggled with a Pi overheating, because we deployed it at first without any heatsinks and no fan. There’s probably a documentation (or pointer to documentation outside the project proper) opportunity here.\n\nOverall, PhotonVision was a success for us and specifically a success for me who argued “don’t buy those LL -3Gs; I know an answer that will fit our needs better [and be cheaper]”",

                    "cooked": "In the web interface, when you have the “Multitag” Estimation enabled, when you are looking at a tag that’s constantly “flickering” as an unstable target, the interface shifts around components as those tag estimates keep showing up and going away. It makes it somewhat impossible to click stuff (this is on the page where you can adjust exposure, brightness, etc.) It’s kind of annoying, and would make adjusting those values a little faster if they didn’t move so much. The reason I bring this up is during field cals we like to change the exposure, and if the tag estimate is flickering, it makes it impossible to drag the slider because the slider position just keeps moving on our screen.\n\nNow, this may also be because our window size was too small or something, but I just wanted to mention it since it did happen so often (every time we did field cals). It’s a really nitpicky quality of life change, but I would request that the tag estimates are “hideable” so you don’t have to deal with it while messing with the settings.",

Absolute lifesaver of a feature\n\nvision simulation: Added in almost no time at all, really well done.\n\nBad:\n\nThe translation matrix for setting up camera could benefit from a visualizer, although we didn’t struggle too much due to how our cameras were set up.\n\nA few times we had cameras not show up on boot, requiring a reset.\n\nDespite setting camera names/serials, we still wound up having designated USB ports for them. Something about the device id handling didn’t pin things like we were hoping for.\n\nUgly:\n\nMulti-tag filtering, prioritization, and standard deviations. We couldn’t pin down sensible values or processes, and most of the time when trying to input scaling based on distance or other confidence values, our position became nonsensical (literally spiraling around the reef). We eventually just gave up and left it as “default”, which was too aggressive, and instantly reset pose. This worked for comps, but not for our practice field. Better examples of how to set this up would be appreciated.\n\nTraining object detection is an undocumented mess (not just a photonvision problem, but just generally). We eventually got things working with enough hacking, but this is a  place that would benefit from a well written tutorial by someone experienced in the craft.\n\nOverall though, very satisfied, and once things were working, it was rock solid and very effective.

I think simplicity would actually go a long way into easing set up for most teams.\n\nBad part 2: The details for calibration, and how important calibration is, and how to calibrate multiple camera sets for hot swap really need to be emphasized, put in size 70 font, and bolded. we host workshops for teams teaching them how to go from zero to swerve, and a lot of teams were clueless on how critical it was.\n\nUgly Part 1, seconding above: Multi-tag filtering, prioritization, and standard deviation tuning were a major struggle. Clearer examples or guidance on setting this up properly would be incredibly helpful.\n\nUgly part 2,  ** Object detection** same notes as above\n\nUgly part 3, ** calibrating for inconsistencies on the field between sides, or with a reef.\n\nReally happy with your guys work, and am exited to see the new features.",

I could then use those photos offline for calibration (manually filtered to trash bad ones), accuracy testing, etc.  I really would like to see PV embrace more abilities to work offline; IMO it would improve and simplify things like accuracy testing.",

Charuco being able to capture/calibrate on partial grid capture made it much easier to follow the recommendations for rotating the board and getting all the way in the corners of the camera frame. This was pretty frustrating to do on a square checkerboard pattern, and often left the corners with poor coverage on the calibration, and with the board held mostly square to the camera.",

                    "cooked": "Initial setup and calibration for 3 cameras (across 2 co-processors) was painless and took only ~2 hours. This is our second year using PhotonVision, so we mostly copy/pasted our robot-side pose estimation code from last year which was already sufficiently tuned for filtering vision measurements, further reducing the time required for bring-up.\n\nWe ran the entire season with the cscore frame time fix enabled and didn’t observe any degradation in performance (rather, the opposite). Granted, we did not perform any rigorous analysis on the accuracy of reported frame latency, so we may be blissfully unaware of its potential shortcomings. Regardless, from our perspective the ~80% boost in FPS seemed to come at no cost to pose accuracy. If it’s useful to anyone, all of our robot logs from the 2025 season are public and accessible here , which includes NT data published by PhotonVision.\n\nNotably, we also utilized both of the new solve methods with great success; PNP_DISTANCE_TRIG_SOLVE while enabled due to its stability, and CONSTRAINED_SOLVEPNP with headingFree = true while disabled for seeding the initial position of the robot. We felt these methods were better suited for this year’s field than MULTI_TAG_PNP_ON_COPROCESSOR as we only used reef tags, of which a single camera would rarely see two of simultaneously.\n\nOccasionally (probably 1/50 startups), one of our co-processors would fail to boot into the OS. Ultimately, we’re still not sure if this is due to our hardware setup (Orange Pi 5 Pro, Sandisk 16GB Industrial MicroSD , Redux Zinc-V, OV9281), user error, something upstream from PhotonVision, or gremlins in our robot. Fortunately, there is a status light on the Orange Pi that signals if it has booted, typically around 5 seconds after the board starts receiving power. Relaying instructions to our drive team on how to diagnose and fix a bad boot (“If you don’t see blue blinky, power cycle ”) was enough to prevent any failed matches.\n\nWe had issues with old heading data provided to a PhotonPoseEstimator “poisoning” future estimates after a pose or rotation reset, which was a particular issue at the start of autonomous routines where we would see our estimated robot pose move unpredictably after resetting odometry. We had to resolve this issue by importing a modified PhotonPoseEstimator into our code with a method added to allow the heading buffer to be manually cleared.\n\nGranted, later on we switched to running CONSTRAINED_SOLVEPNP while disabled to retrieve our initial field position (as previously mentioned) instead of resetting our pose to a predetermined location, but this issue still may be a potential footgun for other users. I just opened a PR to upstream our fix.\n\nEven though we did encounter some issues, overall our experience with PhotonVision this year was immensely positive, and we’re excited to continue using Photon for the foreseeable future. Huge thank you to the maintainers and contributors for all of your work!",

We were able to get very accurate fusing of vision and odometry pose estimates.\n\nThe bad: We were affected by the # 1771 issue with exposure on the OV9281s.  Since a fix was not found or implemented we had to manually flip autoexposure on and off every time the robot was booted, including every competition round.  It wasn’t a huge issue, but something we had to remember to do.\n\nThe ugly: Very rarely, like one in 50 matches, either at-home practice or at competition, one of our camera streams would shut down and reset.  We were usually able to notice this happened since our pose accuracy was noticeably poorer.  When the camera stream came back up (pretty quickly), we’d have to pop open a browser and do the autoexposure on/off thing (shout out to our drive coach for quick action the 1 or 2 times this happened in competition).  This didn’t seem like a hardware problem since it happened so infrequently and to different cameras.  We were not able to identify the problem and (as a result) are not positive that PV was the root cause.  It seems worth noting, though.",

Are you referring to something else?\n\nAnother necessary argument for creating a PhotonPoseEstimator is the Transform3d representing the robot-relative location and orientation of the camera. A Transform3d contains a Translation3d and a Rotation3d . The Translation3d is created in meters and the Rotation3d is created with radians. For more information on the coordinate system, please see the Coordinate Systems documentation.\n\nJAVA\n\npublic static final Transform3d kRobotToCam = new Transform3d(new Translation3d(0.5, 0.0, 0.5), new Rotation3d(0, 0, 0));",

I looked back at the Twitch archive for practice 2 on Curie, which is the last time it happened.  We missed one of our three L4 auto and I can see the driver pointing at the drive computer screen, but no one behind the glass fixes the exposure once teleop starts.  I followed up with them and they confirmed that they just ran with bad exposure on the one camera in that match and the other time it happened at a regional.  They added that when connected to FMS , opening the browser and adding a camera stream from the PV dashboard would put us over the bandwidth limit and they also didn’t want to divert attention from the field in a real match, so they knew they were just going to live with the issue if it happened in competition. It was only in at-home practice that they would fix it.",
