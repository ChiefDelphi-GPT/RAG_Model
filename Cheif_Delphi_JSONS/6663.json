                    "cooked": "A Gamification System for logging team tasks and student skills… I have some notes.\n\nGamifyFRC is a project that aims to make the FIRST Robotics Competition ( FRC ) more engaging and fun for students. The project is inspired by the idea of gamification, which is the application of game design elements to non-game contexts. By incorporating elements of games into the FRC experience, we hope to motivate students to learn more about robotics and engineering, and to develop their skills in these areas.\n\nThe main goal of GamifyFRC is to make the FRC experience more enjoyable and rewarding for students. We believe that by adding game-like elements to the meeting and competition process, we can increase student engagement and participation. This, in turn, will help students develop their skills in robotics and engineering, and will encourage them to pursue careers in these fields. In addition their skills are recorded and can be used to help them get internships and jobs.\n\nGamifyFRC includes a number of features that are designed to make the FRC experience more engaging and fun. These features include:\n\nLocal WiFi or Non-Internet based system for use both at the lab and at competitions\n\nA point system that rewards students for participating in meetings, completing tasks, and achieving goals\n\nA leaderboard that displays the top students in skill categories\n\nAchievements that students can earn by completing specific tasks or challenges\n\nA shop where students can spend their points on rewards and prizes\n\nA profile page where students can track their progress and see their achievements. This also serves as a resume for internships and jobs.\n\nQR codes that can be scanned to earn points for attending meetings or completing tasks\n\nWeb based with NodeJS, EJS, Express, and SQLite3\n\nRunnable on a Raspberry Pi\n\nMVC based open source code\n\nTask: A task is a specific activity or challenge that students can complete to earn points. Tasks can be assigned by mentors or team leaders, and can range from simple exercises to complex projects. Tasks may have points in multiple skill categories.\n\nAchievement: An achievement is a special reward that students can earn by completing a specific set of tasks or challenges. Achievements are more difficult to earn than regular points, and are designed to encourage students to push themselves and develop their skills. This come with bonus points upon completion.\n\nLeaderboard: The leaderboard displays the top students in each skill category, based on the number of points they have earned. The leaderboard is updated in real-time, so students can see how they rank compared to their peers.\n\nShop: The shop is where students can spend their points on rewards and prizes. The shop offers a variety of items, including gift cards, merchandise, and other incentives. Students can also purchase special privileges, such as the ability to skip a task or challenge.\n\nProfile: The profile page is where students can track their progress and see their achievements. The profile page displays the student’s current point total, their rank on the leaderboard, and a list of the tasks and achievements they have completed. This also serves as a resume for internships and jobs.\n\nSkills Categories: The skill categories are the different areas in which students can earn points. These categories include, but are not limited to mechanical, electrical, programming, design, and outreach. Each task is assigned points in one or more skill categories, depending on the skills required to complete the task.\n\nStudents: The students are one type of user in the system. They can earn points, complete tasks, earn achievements, and spend their points in the shop. They can also view the leaderboard and their profile page.\n\nTeam Leaders: The team leaders are another type of user in the system. They can assign tasks, track student progress, and update the leaderboard. They can also view student profiles and achievements.\n\nMentors: The mentors are another type of user in the system. They can create and assign tasks, track student progress, and update the leaderboard. They can also view student profiles and achievements.\n\nCoaches: The coaches are another type of user in the system. They are system administrators and have access to all features of the system. They can create and assign tasks, track student progress, update the leaderboard, and manage the shop. They can also view student profiles and achievements, and can add or remove students, mentors, and coaches from the system.\n\nStudents log in to the system using their username and password.\n\nStudents view the list of tasks that are available to them, along with the points that each task is worth.\n\nStudents complete tasks by following the instructions and submitting their work to a mentor or team leader for review.\n\nStudents earn points for completing tasks, and can track their progress on the leaderboard and their profile page.\n\nStudents can spend their points in the shop to purchase rewards and prizes.\n\nStudents can earn achievements by completing specific sets of tasks or challenges, and earn bonus points for doing so.\n\nMentors log in to the system using their username and password.\n\nMentors view the list of tasks that are available to students, along with the points that each task is worth.\n\nMentors can make new tasks or edit and delete tasks. They also can assign tasks to students.\n\nMentors can view the progress of students on the leaderboard and their profile page.\n\nMentors can “sign off” on tasks that students have completed, and award them the appropriate points.\n\nMentors can create achievements and assign them to students who have completed the required tasks or challenges.\n\nTask Creation and Assignment\n\nA mentor logs in to the system and creates a new task for students to complete. The task is worth 10 points in the mechanical skill category, and requires students to cut a piece of metal to a specific length using a bandsaw.\n\nThe mentor assigns the task to the task list.\n\nStudents log in to the system and see the new task on the list. They read the instructions and complete the task by cutting the metal to the correct length.\n\nThe students bring their phone/device they logged in with to the mentor, who scans the QR code on the task page to verify that the task has been completed.\n\nThe points are added to that student’s total, and they can see their progress on the leaderboard and their profile page.\n\nThe task is added to their overall history of tasks completed.\n\nAchievement Completion\n\nA student has completed a number of tasks in the mechanical skill category, and has earned enough points to qualify for the “Master Mechanic” achievement.\n\nThe mentor logs in to the system and creates the “Master Mechanic” achievement, which is worth 50 bonus points in the mechanical skill category.\n\nThe mentor assigns the achievement to the student, who receives a notification that they have earned the achievement.\n\nThe student’s total points are updated to reflect the bonus points they have earned, and they can see their progress on the leaderboard and their profile page.\n\nThe achievement is added to their overall history of achievements earned.\n\nMultiple Skill Categories Tasks\n\nA mentor logs in to the system and creates a new task for students to complete. The task is worth 20 points in the mechanical skill category and 10 points in the programming skill category, and requires students to design and build a lego robot that can follow a line on the floor.\n\nThe mentor assigns the task to the task list.\n\nStudents log in to the system and see the new task on the list. They read the instructions and complete the task by designing and building the lego robot.\n\nThe students bring their phone/device they logged in with to the mentor, who scans the QR code on the task page to verify that the task has been completed.\n\nThe points are added to that student’s total in both the mechanical and programming skill categories, and they can see their progress on the leaderboard and their profile page.\n\nThe task is added to their overall history of tasks completed.\n\nShop Purchase\n\nA student has earned 100 points and decides to spend them in the shop.\n\nThe student logs in to the system and goes to the shop page, where they see a variety of items available for purchase.\n\nThe student selects a gift card for a local restaurant, which costs 50 points.\n\nThe student confirms the purchase, and the points are deducted from their total. _ The shop page is updated to reflect the student’s purchase, and the student can see their updated point total on their profile page.\n\nThe student receives a notification that they have successfully purchased the gift card.\n\nTheir total on the leaderboard is not affected but their spending points total is updated. The leaderboard is always a lifetime total score for the skill categories.\n\nA coach will be notified of the purchase and will give the student the gift card.\n\nProfile Page\n\nA student logs in to the system and goes to their profile page, where they can see their current point total, their rank on the leaderboard, and a list of the tasks and achievements they have completed.\n\nThe student can also see their progress in each skill category, and view their overall history of tasks and achievements.\n\nThe student can update their profile information, such as their name, email address, and password.\n\nThe student can also download their profile page as a PDF, which they can use as a resume for internships and jobs.\n\nOther users can view the student’s profile page, but cannot edit it and it is not downloadable.\n\nFeel free to run with it! I started on this on paper,  haven’t gone any further. Planned around NodeJs, SQLlite3 and EJS.\n\nIf you don’t want to deal with the environment setup (it’s not that bad), Repl.it has nodeJS environments you can use that will set itself up (libraries install based on your imports) with correct code.",
