Contribute to stormbots/stormbots.github.io development by creating an account on GitHub.\n\nhttps://stormbots.github.io/\n\nUnfortunately, this way of having the site didn’t really pan out; While we did try to make it user-friendly to upload and change, this involved a custom IDE to a degree. At the time there wasn’t great IDE and tooling support, and the media-focused teams didn’t want to deal with running a local site and build processes to check their changes. In particular, the amount of code needed to change the visuals was a problem for them. As a result, it didn’t survive the 2019 season, and the site was rebuilt using a different content manager entirely. As far as feedback goes, this is the big one: Make sure it’s easy to use, and has proper buy in before committing to the big picture and doing the more difficult design efforts.\n\nFor a Contact form, you’ll need to be mindful of your hosting solution. Because Hugo is a static site tool, some hosts (such as Github.io ) don’t provide a way to run server-side code, locking you out of some options. Google Forms is probably the easiest solution in that case, but with most hosts you can do it easily enough using a simple JS form and a backend script to send an email out or record on a text document.",

It’s a very basic Hugo site setup under the Ananke theme which was picked out by our business/marketing team 2 years ago. They have all since moved on and the current subteam is not technical. Just setting up Hugo on Path, getting VsCode setup and explaining GitHub to them was “too much” and I can see what they mean.\n\ntekdemo:\n\nBecause Hugo is a static site tool, some hosts (such as Github.io ) don’t provide a way to run server-side code, locking you out of some options. Google Forms is probably the easiest solution in that case\n\nOur backend hosting is through GoDaddy and Cpanel. I’m not super familiar with all of its features, but I don’t believe I can do backend scripting. Currently our contact form is as you guessed an embedded Google form or it’s a JotForm embed (I have an account I use for my side business I pay for and I make forms for the team on occasion with it).\n\nBoth were easy solutions and the upside of Google forms is they can be linked to the team email and Google drive where we store data already. I’m sure jotform can do the same but I’m planning to cancel that account anyways.\n\nOther options available are firebase hosting with backend availability or setting it up on a heroku server that can support NodeJS backend (what I’m very comfortable with).\n\nFinally because I use Hugo for FRCZero.org I have been working on a wysiwyg editor for Hugo websites but it’s been slow. Ultimately I would like that system to be signed into via your GitHub account, pull down the latest version and automatically make a new branch when someone is making a new page, editing, etc. the front end would look like a markdown text editor for their current page with a live preview window on the side. There are plenty of Rich Text editors that can create markdown as an output. The editor here on CD might be built on the same plugin I was looking at for this. I really like it and it does generate markdown as expected.",
