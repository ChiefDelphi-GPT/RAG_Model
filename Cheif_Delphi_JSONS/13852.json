This, of course, leads to increasing congestion. CAN is, after all, a bus, and whenever any device sends a message, it occupies the whole bus for a millisecond or so. These days, approaching 100% CAN bus utilization is a real possibility for some teams.\n\nI’m interested to see what the community thinks is the best way forward. Bear in mind, when I say “best”, I don’t just mean “most technical capability”, I mean the whole cost vs. capacity vs. complexity vs. reliability trade.\n\nCAN (it’s fine as it is) CAN -FD (5 Mbps) Multiple CAN busses (one safety-critical bus for commanding motor controllers etc., plus one or more for noncritical data) Multiple CAN busses (all the same) RS-485 or derivatives (Profibus, etc.) 100BASE-T1, or some other variety of Ethernet Other (explain in comments) 0 voters\n\nCAN (it’s fine as it is) CAN -FD (5 Mbps) Multiple CAN busses (one safety-critical bus for commanding motor controllers etc., plus one or more for noncritical data) Multiple CAN busses (all the same) RS-485 or derivatives (Profibus, etc.) 100BASE-T1, or some other variety of Ethernet Other (explain in comments)\n\nCAN (it’s fine as it is)\n\nCAN -FD (5 Mbps)\n\nMultiple CAN busses (one safety-critical bus for commanding motor controllers etc., plus one or more for noncritical data)\n\nMultiple CAN busses (all the same)\n\nRS-485 or derivatives (Profibus, etc.)\n\n100BASE-T1, or some other variety of Ethernet\n\nOther (explain in comments)\n\n0 voters\n\n0 voters\n\n0 voters",

I’m a bit surprised we’re already at the 1mbps ceiling of CAN personally, but it can be hard to nail down why. That said, I’m also a little surprised we’re limited to 1mbps still.\n\nI personally vote for anything other than CAN, just so we don’t have to keep reading CAN topology threads every week.\n\nIdeally, I’d like a RIO with 24 USB-C ports. Realistically, we’re probably not getting that.\n\nMy thought is - we are already plugging all our speed controllers into a central device. And then we are plugging them all into each other.

As it stands, you need to run a CAN wire all across your robot and all the way back to the PDP (unless you have your own terminating resistor) in order to use brushless motor controllers to their fullest potential, unless you make design compromises to either keep all motors where they can’t be hit, lose out on motor-saving current limiting by running PWM, or lose the weight advantage by using a brushed motor.\n\nCAN’s nice, but it’s clear we would have been better off if we had more of a “Super PWM” of sorts that would allow all the features of CAN without the drawback of having your whole robot at risk if one part of the wire goes down.",

CAN -FD for 5Mbps could work sure, but do the devices we already have support it?\n\nThe only sensible solution in my mind is encapsulation and mitigation.  Put existing CAN traffic over discrete sub-buses using any significantly faster / lower latency bus as the transport method, and then re-transmit.  That’ll keep sub-bus latency and utilization low, but not make every CAN device we’ve invested thousands of dollars per team into, useless.\n\nThe obvious methodology is RS485 based (and encapsulating the 29-bit CAN packet within 4-5 RS485 8N1 packets) on the new REV Control System but they’ve said:\n\nREV Robotics - 2022 FRC Control System\n\nAs it was pointed out by @ josesantos and others, we use RS485 on other devices we make.\n\nWhile there are no current plans for this interface in FRC , or the crossover for these new hubs into other programs, we feel that it was worth it to standardize our hub interfaces and that:\n\n“it might be useful later.”\n\nEven as-is it’s possible to hit near 90% CAN utilization and the reflectance of poorly wired buses will cause latency and retransmissions. CTRE and REV will probably want to get those CAN status frame tuning guides going sooner rather than later",

The USB-PD spec has provisions for vendor specific mitigations and it’s like all of the USB standards in that everyone is doing their own thing with it. Dell actively sells chargers that hit like 120W today.\n\nThat’s also not the full story.  It’s an evolving standard and the current (no pun intended) working groups have met on a 240W standard: USB Charger (USB Power Delivery) | USB-IF\n\nThis will get higher or we might see a derivative connector specific to high power draw applications come along soon.

Personally, I’d like to see the radio become the locked piece of kit on the 'bots, with compute opened up.  This would mean the replacement radio would have Ethernet ports, CAN ports, and perhaps BroadR-Reach (or similar) ports.  This would make it fairly central, as is the PDP – so an external antenna might also be a good addition.  In this model, the radio handles the safety stuff and the compute only gets access to CAN via the radio.",

One option to address this could be to allow certain approved compute devices (e.g. the Rio) to control via PWM (and they would have approved software that would listen to the CAN messages for enable control assuming the above implementation).\n\nIt shouldn’t be that major of a barrier, but note this approach would also mean radios would be required for all benchtop setups for programming testing, etc.\n\nThere are some downsides to moving to an open compute system, namely that a standardized processor enables greater reliability (most cheap COTS things are much less reliable than a Rio), spare parts, teams to more easily help each other with issues, a standardized library stack (WPILib), etc.  Teams today pretty much already have the ability to go open compute (e.g. Jetson, Pi, etc) and drive CAN motors from those other devices (with the Rio providing the safety controls), but most teams just use the standard setup because of support reasons and they don’t really need something more powerful.",

Another possibility is more  (approved) things like PCM or CANifier, except with the safety/disable logic and able to control things like relays.\n\nThe point about the ability to use other compute today is a good one.  I know some teams would be really impacted if that were to go away.\n\nThe points about the downsides are also valid.  But, there are also upsides.\n\nThe radio is pretty clearly the weak link in the control system, so it needs updating in any case.  Getting all the regulatory approvals can be a huge pain/expense, except there are modules that can be used (internally) that are already certified.  Putting a small battery or supercap into the radio would be helpful as well.\n\nWPILib is great, and it gets better each year.  There’s a ton of good stuff in there, and it is wonderful that it is open.  If the compute H/W were opened up, I suspect most teams would choose to stay on whatever hardware was supported by WPILib (and/or LabView).  This would apply to the H/W as well I suspect.",
