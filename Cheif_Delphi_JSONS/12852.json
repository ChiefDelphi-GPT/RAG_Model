Then tie a line over the pulley between the connecting rope and the spool.\n\nAdditionally, I would reccomend considering whether your design actually requires two end attachments. For example, most elevators work just fine with one line with an attachment point and pulley reasonably close to the center.\n\nI would not recommend trying to run two ropes through one pulley or trying to coil two ropes on one spool without some sort of divider.",

For example, most elevators work just fine with one line with an attachment point and pulley reasonably close to the center.\n\nThere is a big difference between “work just fine” and “are robust”\n\nIMO, all else equal, the small weight penalty from running two ropes is far less than the penalty that occurs when something goes wrong due to one set of rigging.
