                    "cooked": "Hello! My team is looking for new Xbox controllers (which we will use both in and out of competition) and are considering getting wireless Xbox One controllers. But, we’ve read up on ChiefDelphi and we’re seeing that using a wired connection with a wireless controller during competition can cause issues on occasion. Knowing that teams can’t use a wireless Bluetooth connection during a match, we’re wondering if there’s a way around this connection issue (if not, a wired controller is always an option). Some of the responses I’ve found on this subject mention a micro USB connection being the one that causes an issue (for example, source A and source B ). We’ve found this wireless Xbox One controller from Amazon which uses USB-C rather than micro USB.\n\nDoes anyone know whether a USB-C would perform better than micro USB for this purpose? Or, does anyone have experience with this wired-wireless-controller connection issue and know how to avoid it?\n\nThank you in advance!",

Im not too familiar with Xbox controllers, but id assume there is a way to keep that function turned off (quick searching implies that being wired has it automatically off.)",

Though in some cases with high quality Micro USB Connector Housings, the wear may mostly be on the cable, which can more easily be replaced to regain some of the holding force, more-so than with USB C cables. Overall USB C is the future.\n\nYou do need to make sure that when wired in, the controller is using ONLY the wired connection to the computer. If you physically unplug the controller it should NOT then connect wirelessly at a competition.\n\nPersonally, 3468 has been buying the PowerA Wired Controllers the last couple years. I like that the connectors are very deep-set which helps avoid the cables being accidentally pulled out, but these have no wireless functionality.",

I have seen several occasions where a wireless controller may randomly disconnect, even just for a few seconds, which is certainly not ideal.\n\nIn terms of micro-USB vs USB-C, for a controller there is a negligible difference between the two. As @MikLast stated, Micro-USB cables are becoming an older cable and are starting to become harder to find in a store if you need one quick. USB-C is much newer and is much easier to find in a store if you need to get a new replacement cable in a jam.\n\nOur team has been using a micro-USB wired controller for the past 5-6 years and have never had an issue with it and have had no issues in terms of resolution or latency. We purchased a 3rd party wired controller which has no wireless functionality, that way we have no worry of wireless interference in any way and it’s also cheaper too.",

I’ve heard that USB-C is much better in this regard (and most others as well).\n\nOverall I’d agree with what folks are saying: get a USB-C controller.

Thanks for the input, obviously any inexpensive Xbox 360 controller would do the trick, in fact this is what we most recently had. Them wearing out was not due to any specific accident, but I also don’t think it was only natural wear and tear, haha. So worst-case scenario we get something like what we already had, probably Power A brand or VOYEE like you suggested, and it really would be alright. We also typically use one of those Logi joysticks for comp, but the copilot at least often likes to use an Xbox controller instead.",
