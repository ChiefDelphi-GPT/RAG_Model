                    "cooked": "We got grant money to replace the donated desktops (now going on 12 years old) that we are using for programming. The existing desktops were pretty much for FRC programming and testing only; the new laptops would be used by FRC , FTC , and FLL .\n\nThe school IT department is being pretty insistent that these end up under the school domain control, and that the students use their domain accounts to log in. Additionally, they want to pull our existing laptops (the ones we use for competition) under school domain control.\n\nI have shared the driver station best practices with them, pointing out items 8 (“Avoid managed Windows 10 or 11 installations from the school’s IT department.”) and 12 (“The Windows user account you use to drive must be a member of the Administrator group.”). That’s moved the bar a little, but I still have concerns.\n\nHere are the issues I see:\n\nfor FRC , using the driver station requires admin access. We can get that on a couple of laptops used for driving at competitions, but I believe that testing code on roboRIO can’t be done from a student account, which is a pretty major impediment. I see this one as a show stopper.\n\nright now, student written code ends up in the “developer” account on the PCs. If Joe and Jo are working together on stuff, and one of them doesn’t show up on a given night, the other one can still get to the code. If the code is under Jo or Joe’s documents directory, the other won’t be able to pick up the work. I believe this can be mitigated by using the public documents directory. Is this correct? Other solutions?\n\nWe’ve expressed concern about some of the policies that the school uses (timeouts, etc), but they are being receptive to those concerns, so fewer worries there.\n\nDoes anyone have any (successful) experience with running a large (4-6 students) programming team in an environment like this?",

In our case, we were able to get a team “Robotics” account created, which has the necessary administrator credentials to run the driver station and update software and so on.\n\nOne other benefit we’ve found to having a team account like this is that since the school district uses Google Drive, we have a central place we can store photos, videos, CAD, and code (though we do use Github for code primarily) and we don’t run into storage limitations.\n\nI believe our current DS laptop is not on the domain (it’s newer and shipped with Win11, while the school still uses Win10) but the previous one was, and while we did have some issues with it, we don’t believe they were because of it being on the domain (more likely hardware). We only have a handful of programming laptops that we use (generally on the domain but used with the “robotics” account) and they’re pretty much only used for programming. For anything else, the students are generally using their own Chromebooks and domain accounts.",

Having only domain account can cause issues, especially with connectivity with the robot and if on the Driver’s station then also with the FMS .  Specifically I would be more concerned about the FMS since weird DNS and Anti-Virus/Anti-Malware configurations can cause significant issues.\n\nI would also immediately convert to using some form of source code management system (i.e. Github).  This is industry standard and should be taught to the students anyway.  Correctly using this can be a huge benifit to the team.\n\nEnjoy!",

We can get that on a couple of laptops used for driving at competitions, but I believe that testing code on roboRIO can’t be done from a student account, which is a pretty major impediment. I see this one as a show stopper.\n\nThis would be the primary concern.  Several things for FRC require admin access, the DS being the most obvious one.\n\nManaged machines can really mess with the stability/flexibility needed for laptops brought to competition, so I would push back hard on that point and insist on those to be unmanaged machines.  Admin alone really isn’t enough for the driver station laptop, as domain policies (e.g. power settings) and mandatory installed services (e.g. custom firewalls, AV) can interfere with DS performance and cause control lag or field connection issues.  This extends past just the driver station machine–shared accounts are a must for other laptops at competition too; the last thing you need is for someone not to be able to log into a laptop at a competition because it can’t authenticate to the domain server.",

I will point out that the OP’s statement does not contradict using a cloud version control system.\n\nWe use Github and have team laptops with a shared account (although many people use their own). It happens a few times a year that someone (sometimes a Mentor) works on some code and forgets to push the changes at the end of the day, typically because things are broken, and then is not available the next session. Being able to track it down and then either continue or push is really helpful.\n\nBTW, the one (?) distinct downside of shared accounts is that it typically messes with the version control log. Inevitably, “all” commits end up being from one account, because someone set up the laptop, and then Git just keeps using that name and credentials. There are plugins, but it is really easy to forget to switch Git accounts.",

Security done correctly should be a mild inconvenience, not a hindrance.\n\nOne of the things we discussed and resolved with school IT on a team I mentored was that in addition to team-owned computers, dozens of people brought in their personal computers to the shop.  What they ended up doing is setting up a separate VLAN for us with just an IP block and a gateway out to the internet (still filtered, but with a separate set of rules from the rest of the school).  It helped a lot to have an engaged principal on our side through the process!",

This is industry standard and should be taught to the students anyway. Correctly using this can be a huge benifit to the team.\n\nWe make extensive use of git and github. I ask the students to always commit and push at the end of day (which leads to a really messy git log), but sometimes that don’t happen (code is not always ready for a commit at the end of the day, students leave unexpectedly early).\n\nIf you are a team that only wants rolled-up-via-rebase commits in github (I would love to get there), then you still have to track down the local repository that has the intermediate commits to do the rebase and pull request.\n\nWe currently do not use shared folders, but a shared signon, but I’m trying to find a good way to conform to the school’s request to not have a shared signon.",
