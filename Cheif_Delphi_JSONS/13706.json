Without knowing the game, we are looking at running a WCD made from the Rev Ion Extrusion (which we will experiment with in the next month). However, I have a few questions.\n\nHow do you determine the drop height of the drop-center wheels, do most WCD still use one?\n\nHow do you accomplish the drop with bearing blocks if they are all the same size (the kit bot has the hole o?\n\nIs there an advantage of using chain over belts?\n\nIs there much advantage to using 3 motors per side over the traditional two?\n\nWe are looking at using this PDF as a model but would love to see other build guides. I am not the best at mechanical design, so any help would be appreciated.",

To be honest if your using brushless you can hit the friction limit with 2 motors depending on the wheels and weight, so  3 motors really don’t matter.",

For the chains vs belts, the chains are more reliable if you plan to do more than one competition but they are also heavier so depending on the robot weight it might be an issue. Also, chains won’t normaly skips if you put down more power or if you are trying to fight off defense. For the motorisation, the more power you have the faster you should be able to go but it really goes down to what acceleration you’re able to get. Most fields won’t need your robot to go 20 feet/s to be competitive. Finally, having 6 motors on your drivetrain can be thé best option if for exemple you have a PTO in order to reuse them for the climb. This particular method is more complex but super efficient.",

They are narrow enough to accommodate leading edge wheels (a favorite feature), and the drop is only 0.04\" which I’ve found to be enough to prevent scrub but not so much there’s notable rocking.  Also the clamping force is hella strong, we did not need the cam to keep the blocks in place.\n\nIf you use belts I strongly recommend 15mm wide ones.  We use #35 chain because we were able to break # 25 in testing, and I didn’t want to have to keep thinking about it.\n\nWe ran 3 motors per side in 2022 because there wasn’t much of a reason not to, and it would have been easy to remove if we needed to (for weight, or to use the motors elsewhere).\n\nEdit to add:  Even with corner omnis I recommend a small drop (personally I like a raised end over center drop, but I doubt it matters).  We tried to do flat/no drop in 2019 and it was mildly sad when we discovered that 6\" colson wheels were actually around 5.995\" and 6\" omni wheels were actually around 6.005\".  We didn’t do anything about it and it turned out fine but I was still sad I overlooked that possibility, I’d have rather had slightly more normal force on the higher traction wheels.",

Some teams choose to run omni-wheels on either the front or back axles to eliminate the need for a center-drop and the associated rocking of the base that you will get.  Omnis on both front and back is also possible, but further limits traction.\n\nWith the VEX bearing blocks, the holes are offset by 1/16\" from center.  You install the center one flipped compared to the outboard ones to net a 1/8\" center drop.\n\nIt’s more compact to use chain if you are trying to get it inside the drive tubes.  Belts inside tubes might be possible with big enough tubes.  Belts need larger pulleys to get enough teeth engaged to handle the torque.\n\nIf you are using the newer brushless motors, you’ll probably find that two motors per side will give you sufficient top-end speed and not be traction-limited.\n\nI’m not in a place right now to link any drivetrain calculators, but assuming that someone else does not post links to the most common ones, I’ll try to remember to do it later.",

When we used the vex blocks we hated their tensioners, we used 1/4-20s to pull the blocks at one point, but this allowed us to massively over tension the chains and skew the bearing alignment on shafts.",

This assumes relatively coarse auto mode requirements, tight auto performance requires tight drivetrain build quality.\n\nNote that you should use a relatively small center adder, something like 0.012\", vs exposed inboard chain where you could run 0.018\".\n\nThe chains or belts in the tubes make it annoying to attach additional things to the drive rails. Your students will be fighting interferences that they can’t see. I wouldn’t do it first year.\n\nWe have settled on inboard chain with clear plastic covers over them to keep wires out while preserving visibility, instead of chain in tube.",

This requires you to install bolts from both the inside and outside. We use custom blocks so we can access all screws by removing the wheel. Looks like the AM ones could also be used with all screws from the outside.\n\nHi! Yes, this was a conscious design choice with our bearing blocks to allow the fasteners to all be accessible from one side. It was also a conscious choice to utilize nut pockets with nylock nuts for the threaded feature, instead of tapping the block. We wanted these to never come loose, and be reusable many many times.\n\n-Nick",

We built a Rev ION chassis over the past month and it functions in a similar way as VersaChassis but it is different. I do not know of a way to do a drop center so you will need to use Omni wheels on one end if you have 3 wheels per side or in each corner if you have 4 wheels per side.\n\nIf you want to run chain/belt inside the MaxTube you are going to need to use plates so that the bearing doesn’t take up the space that the sprockets/pulleys need. We were able to build it with chain inside the tube using REV-21-2012 sprockets.\n\nWe have never run chain in tube before but this makes it so easy that we are probably going to do it this year especially since the MaxSpline spacing makes it so you don’t need to tension the chain.",
