We have had a pretty good experience so far, but with the (probable) discontinuation of Falcons and the added capability of the Kraken motor, we are considering switching to using Krakens as our drive motor. From the information I’ve gathered so far, we would need to buy 3-4 more Krakens and 4 pinion sets for about $700-$900 total. We do have some spare Falcons so a motor failure isn’t a huge issue, we are mostly trying to level up our drivetrain. Is this switch worth the money? Is there anything else we would need to purchase? And what are some other ways we can improve our drivetrain?",

                    "cooked": "Krakens deliver a bit more power and are a bit more efficient at high currents. Altogether though, I don’t think the performance difference matters unless your team is really good. I would think more about how to create a reliable robot and fast mechanisms than the performance of my drivetrain. So if you’ve noticed reliability issues you think are attributable Falcons I would consider that a bigger reason to switch than power.\n\nKrakens probably wouldn’t hurt though (I was happy with them this year), and you can always devote the remaining Falcons to mechanisms.\n\nAnother thing you should budget is buying the torque wrenches from CTRE or WCP with the Krakens, they should be considered required if you want to be certain of not breaking your motors by overtorquing the terminal screws.\n\nProbably the biggest way you can improve your drivetrain is through programming and driver practice. I would look at top teams code and see how they make their swerve drives easy to control.\n\nAnother exercise: watch your past matches and count how much time was spent driving from point A to point B and how much time was spent align/placing/etc. like this: WildStang Robotics Program: Team 111 and 112 Build Blog - 2025 - #366 by DohertyBilly",

Which teams would you say have the best swerve code? We will experiment with ratios in the offseason, I believe we are already gonna rebuild our swerve modules for maintenance as we found a few issues.",

Not sure if I have a good recommendation for something more accessible.\n\nProgramming things to look into:\n\nDoes limiting the acceleration of your drivetrain make it more controllable?\n\nCan you have a “slow mode” for finer control with a lower maximum velocity and acceleration?\n\nButtons to snap the robot to certain angles (we had one for each coral station).\n\nWhen I watch your matches, your robot doesn’t seem particularly slow, just looks like you could use more driver practice and the driving is a bit jerky.",

I am not sure how accurate this actually is or if I took it out of context.

We did see that over time we will have more and more problems with the motors. before isr #4 we switched the drive motor to kraken, and while we did see a performance increase, it wasn’t very big. this year we also had a kraken as the steering motor, and that is because our falcon 500 are old, and because we didn’t have time to test other motors like a neo",

In games with full-field cycling (2023, 2024), a higher max speed is important (so lower ratio with more powerful motors), while in half-field or quarter-field games (2019, 2025) better acceleration and mechanism speed are more important (so falcons at a higher ratio with faster mechanisms is probably better).\n\nYou can do some drivetrain calculations on recalc , that’d help with making the decision.\n\nThere was a great thread a while back that discussed current limits that’s important to note; 3005 seems to do well with vortexes and many other teams use Neos.",
