However, at least 2-3 time a season (if not more often), I find myself blocked because a class was programmed with various parameters as “final”. I can’t even subclass them and add my own setter/getter. I either throw up my hands or copy the code (which is sad).\n\nExample from today:  SingleJointedArmSim - the arm length is fixed. OK, so yes it is much easier to not have to compute certain parameters each loop, but there are a ton of extending arms out there.\n\nAnother examples I can dredge up: ArmFeedForward (and presumably all the others): the K’s are all final. For an extending arm, it would not be hard for the user to have a linear model for Kg and maybe the others, but right now, they have no way to update the values and have to ignore the class.\n\nI remember there were other examples we hit last year. I think they were related to the Trapezoidal subsystem. If I remember we could not update any of the constants after the constructor, and could not even do that with our own subclass.\n\nBeyond rote style rules, is there any reason just about every parameter is set as “final”?",

Properly modeling an arm with varying length is not as simple as just adding a setter to change a value, as it’s a coupled system.  Maybe it might work in some instances as an approximation, but to do it right (eg work in all instances, which is what we want our classes to do) requires a completely different model.  We don’t currently have such a model worked out, if we did, it would be a separate class.  The reason we don’t have one is that extending arms were relatively rare in FRC before this year.  It’s something we can look at adding in the future (contributions happily accepted).\n\nPrivate variables without a setter should be marked final, as there’s no way to change them from outside the class anyway.",

Sure, you could copy the whole class, and clean out all the “locking”, but why not allow that from the beginning?\n\n(And just a small note: on a simple FRC scale, an extending arm is not really a coupled system. To the accuracy that the model is known, it would be fine to move the center of mass out by X and recompute the MoI. After all, SingleJointedArmSim already has “estimateMOI” which assumes a linear weight distribute, which is probably not right for any real arm.)",

Why can’t these be written with setters/getters and allow the end user to apply a (external) model?\n\nWe don’t intend for users to override the class. If we wanted to be really opinionated about it, we could have even marked the class as final. Changing the dynamics of the single-jointed arm feedforward makes it not a single-jointed arm anymore.\n\nRegarding the implementation being trivial, that won’t be the case after we implement Add ArmFeedforward calculate() overload that takes current and next velocity instead of acceleration · Issue #5192 · wpilibsuite/allwpilib · GitHub . While the internals are simpler right now, the API doesn’t reflect the typical use case: “I know where I am and where I want to be next timestep. What voltage do I need to accomplish that?”.\n\nprensing:\n\nAnd just a small note: on a simple FRC scale, an extending arm is not really a coupled system. To the accuracy that the model is known, it would be fine to move the center of mass out by X and recompute the MoI.\n\nIt is actually a coupled system. When the arm is rotating, a force is applied to the arm radially outward ( F = mv^2/r ) . This is more noticeable for heavier arms with weaker motors to hold them in place.\n\nWe prefer to implement higher fidelity solutions because it’s easier to wrap reasonable defaults around those than it is for a team to implement the higher fidelity solution themselves if/when they need it.\n\nprensing:\n\nSingleJointedArmSim already has “estimateMOI” which assumes a linear weight distribute, which is probably not right for any real arm.\n\nThis is actually an example of what I just described. We offer a default for users that don’t need or want a more accurate value, but users can plug in a more accurate value from CAD or system ID if they need to. They don’t need to go implement a custom thing to accurately model their system.\n\nTo give you a sense of how I think about feedforwards, they’re duals of our physics sim classes; physics sim computes state evolution from inputs, and feedforward computes inputs from state evolution. We strive for maximal fidelity of the physics sims when we can, and the feedforwards benefit directly from that work.\n\nIf the goal is to simulate a telescoping arm, a dedicated class should be made for that with the appropriate dynamics. Then, a feedforward can be derived more generally from what it does. We do the hard math (because we can and it’s fun) so teams don’t have to.",

I am curious if our interpetation of the ArmFeedForward for a telescoping arm was correct, It worked very well when we finally did it but that doesn’t mean it was correct .   We used sysId to determine the feed forward constants for our arm fully retracted and another set of constants for fully extened. We created 2 instances of ArmFeedForward, one for each set of constants. Then when we were moving the arm we did ran the max extension ff calculate and the min extension ff calculate and did a linear interpolation between the two based on our current extension.",
