                    "cooked": "As part of giving to the community and as a community project, we are proud to share ExcaLib with the FRC competition community.  \n\nExcaLib is a comprehensive Java library built on top of WPILibJ, designed to simplify and accelerate robot development for FRC teams of all levels. Whether you're a rookie team or an experienced team, ExcaLib provides solutions for simplifying your code.  \n\nWhat is inside?  \n- Pre-built mechanism classes for common mechanisms like arms, elevators, turrets, and flywheels.  \n- A complete custom swerve drive implementation with advanced control and easy setup – will be released with v.1.0.0.  \n- PID, motion profiling, and feedforward utilities and controls.  \n- Generic hardware wrappers for motors, motor groups, and IMUs, making your development even simpler.  \n- Command-based extensions for WPILib.  \n- Built-in telemetry/logging via NetworkTables.  \n- Utilities for common robot tasks, such as alliance utilities for geometry-based functions.  \n\nExcaLib was developed by Team 6738 Excalibur and used extensively during the 2025 Reefscape season, powering a full competition robot.  \n\nWe started using it at the 2024 Israeli Off-Season and throughout four events in the 2025 season. After seeing that ExcaLib works well, we decided to share it with the entire community.  \n\nEven though this is not a beta – it’s a well-tested release, now publicly available as a pre-release version. We welcome your feedback, issues, and proposals.  \n\nGet Started  \nFull documentation: https://excalib.excaliburfrc.com  \nGitHub repository: https://github.com/ExcaliburFRC/ExcaLib  \n\nWhy ExcaLib?  \nWe built ExcaLib because we were tired of rewriting the same logic every season – tuning controllers, wrapping hardware, wiring up logging systems. We wanted a foundation that was clean, scalable, and easy to implement, with just the right abstractions to let your team focus on innovation.  \n\nIf you’re an FRC dev looking to save time, reduce bugs, and write smarter code – give ExcaLib a try.  \n\nWe’d love to hear your feedback, suggestions, or feature requests.  \n\nLet’s build better robot code, together.  \n\n-= Team 6738, Excalibur FRC =-",

                    "cooked": "For classes such as TalonFXMotor, it would be really helpful to know what they extend (TalonFX class from CTRE in this case). This isn't highlighted in the docs, and I stumbled across that fun fact in the source code. This would let me know that I can still call methods that return status signals, or interface with the motor directly. I like that design choice, but please tell us in the docs!\n\nSome notes on the documentation:\n\n- Units are sometimes unclear. For example, in your Quickstart page, you pass a method reference (firstMotor::getMotorPosition). But you never make it clear to the user that these units are in meters, except for on a separate page.\n\n- I may just be misunderstanding the terminology, but the phrase \"position conversion factor\" doesn't make much sense by itself. I see that it's a unit conversion, but without the example, I can't say I've heard that term referred to as a position conversion factor before. If the docs made it clear what this term meant, that would help greatly. I can make a guess, but that's never as good as the docs just telling me. IMO, docs can be verbose without being scary to look at and maintaining understandability.\n\n- This is pretty nitpicky, so take my advice with a grain of salt. However, for the method AlliancePose.getMirrored() and getRotated(), it would help to make it clear that these are dependent on the DS's connection status (i.e., creating these at robot init will cause problems if it switches to the red alliance). I see it'll output a warning, but from the docs themselves, I may not realize this, especially if I haven't shot myself in the foot with that one before.\n\n- It's obvious that your API docs aren't the plain docs generated by Javadoc (they look very nice, good work!), but when I'm browsing the API for WPILib I find myself looking at the source code often, because it's linked to the method names in their descriptions. If that could be implemented, that would be super.\n\nBut don't get the impression I'm not impressed. This is super interesting, and I'm interested to see where this goes!\n\nFinally, there seems to be a bug with the API docs. This may just be me, but clicking on some fields (IdleState and DirectionState seem to be problematic) don't load, and instead crash the site. Reloading opens a vercel error page.\n\nThis is the site after clicking on IdleState. I reload, and get this:\n\nThis error page also happens whenever I reload any site on any page that isn't the homescreen. Among other things, this means I can't \"open in new tab\" anything, nor can I duplicate the tab. I have to duplicate the tab and then go to the home page and then go back to whatever I need to see, which isn't great for quickly looking at the docs and the API at the same time. A fix would be appreciated, but it's not a big deal.",

Fixed an issue where refreshing a page would crash the route page. Added clearance to the AlliancePose subclass. Clarified the position conversion factor - it’s simply the number of motor rotations per swerve wheel rotation (or any other wheel or gear). I’ll also add a note in the docs for extra clarity, just in case. Thanks so much for the feedback!",

This means each motor rotation corresponds to \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\)th of a full turn, which translates to \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{5} \\) radians.",
