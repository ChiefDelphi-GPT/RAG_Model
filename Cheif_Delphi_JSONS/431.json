                    "cooked": "I have been playing around with using the cOPRs available through TBA to use for match predictions, similarly to this older post (although my model is a simpler binary predictor) and some others. I think a trained model would be better suited for the relationship between alliance members (and the limits of the field) than a purely algebraic model. (E.g. two robots that can fill L4 on one alliance wouldn’t: they would likely fill L4 and L3. It seems possible but very tedious to create.)\n\nTest matches are all subsequent matches (the week indicates the training data).\n\nThe results seem good (some overfitting?), but all of the matches were using data from after each event had ended (instead of from the previous matches), which makes it hard to tell if the model is actually an improvement over other methods.\n\nSo, my question is: Is there an easy way to access historical TBA data from the same event? Unless I am really misunderstanding something, using cOPRs from before each match should show realistic inaccuracies in early matches. If not, how are the TBA cOPRs calculated? I saw that you can get alliance scoring data per match through their API, would calculating them be similar to how TBA calculates OPRs ? (I have briefly looked through their repository, but I couldn’t find anything relevant.)\n\nAny other insights would also be helpful, since I am neither a statistics nor a Python expert. Currently, I am using a LightGBM model with all of the available TBA statistics, as well as hyperparameter tuning on the lambda values, the num_leaves, bagging_freq, bagging_fraction, and feature_fraction. I have also tried several custom neural networks, but they were significantly slower to train and slightly less accurate.\n\nThanks.",

                    "cooked": "cafougner:\n\nSo, my question is: Is there an easy way to access historical TBA data from the same event?\n\nI am nearly 100% confident that the match-by-match evolution of cOPR as calculated by TBA for an event is not saved.\n\ncafougner:\n\nUnless I am really misunderstanding something, using cOPRs from before each match should show realistic inaccuracies in early matches. If not, how are the TBA cOPRs calculated?\n\nIf you re-compute the cOPRs match-by-match using the available match data then the issues created by trying to estimate contribution from an underdetermined linear system when only a few matches are complete will be “realistic”. TBA attempts to stabilize cOPRs early in an event using a minimum mean squared error (MMSE) solution to the system which involves the use of prior cOPR estimates.  Interpreting the terse TBA cOPR code is not for the faint-of-heart, but it’s available.\n\ncafougner:\n\nAny other insights would also be helpful, since I am neither a statistics nor a Python expert.\n\nWhy are you trying to improve match predictions?  Are you looking for a tangible benefit or are you just pursuing an academic exercise?  To the extent match prediction has value, what additional value would you expect to gain over something like the readily available Statbotics match predictions?",

Take a look at scoutR::event_opr_progression() . If this is your first time using R, I have a new users vignette . The documentation still has a long way to go before it really onboards you without guidance from someone who knows R, but that’s all I’ve got right now\n\nAs an example, this line of code returns a dataframe for the 2025 CHS Glen Allen district event (“2025vagle”) with 36 columns (34 teams at the event, plus one for the number of matches and one for the number of matches per team) and 51 rows (68 matches played, the linear model is only defined starting with match 18.)\n\nevent_opr_progression(“2025vagle”, response_name = “autoCoralCount”)\n\nScreenshot 2025-05-30 103058 1888×954 137 KB\n\nScreenshot 2025-05-30 103058 1888×954 137 KB\n\nScreenshot 2025-05-30 103058 1888×954 137 KB",

Are you looking for a tangible benefit or are you just pursuing an academic exercise?\n\nThe primary purpose for my project was to learn more about machine learning; making something that could be useful would be nice, but I wanted to learn more about different types of neural networks and how to create/use them.\n\nWith the models that I’ve made, I think I have a better (albeit basic) understanding of them, and I was interested in seeing how accurate of a model I could make. Although, from what @Skyehawk said, if accuracy is what I want, then there are better ways to approach the problem.\n\nSkyehawk:\n\nI put together a cascading model for limited scoring locations/gampieces for the 2025 game component EPAs\n\nIf you have the time, I would definitely like to see how you decided to implement this, even if it isn’t necessarily an improvement.\n\nGKrotkov:\n\nIf you’re comfortable dipping into R, I maintain a package for myself and my students with a function that computes the (c) OPR progression over the course of an event.\n\nAs per my original post, this seems almost exactly like what I was looking for. I haven’t ever used R (and I also have many more side-project ideas now), but if I ever to come back to this I will definitely look into it.\n\nThanks for all the help, everyone!",
