                    "cooked": "Hi everyone, our team is somewhat inexperienced when it comes to making controllable arms. We are experiencing a lot of backlash right now with our setup of a maxplanetary gearbox + 90 degree gearbox + chain onto a 1/2 in hexbar which pivots our arm. Moreover, our arm is very bouncy (if we are still and then I apply a force onto the arm it bounces with a large amplitude).\n\nWe are wondering if there are any quick fixes that wouldn’t require a complete redesign?\n\nWe are considering increasing the size of the sprocket that directly mounts onto the hex, or removing our chain altogether and putting the motor with a 90 degree gearbox directly onto the hex. We are also thinking about decreasing the length of the hex between the pivot point of the arm and the motor.\n\nAny ideas would be greatly appreciated",

Planetary gearboxes have some backlash, MAX90 gearboxes have more backlash, and hex shaft has some backlash… chain can introduce backlash if it isn’t super tight.\n\nPlanetary backlash: pretty much need to live with it without a big redesign\n\nMAX90 backlash: I would try designing this out of the system if possible\n\nChain backlash: use an inline turnbuckle or external chain tensioner to ensure your chain is extremely tight\n\nHex shaft: you can shim hex shaft to remove quite a bit of backlash but an even better solution would be switching to MAX Spline if your design allows\n\nA stackup of many small sources of backlash can easily result in 15 degrees or more at the arm.\n\nSome pictures would be helpful to provide more specific recommendations.",

These tend to have a couple degrees of backlash, which add up quickly with a long arm. If possible I would recommend finding a way to either bolt the sprocket driving the arm directly to the arm, or switch to another type of axle, like maxspline. A larger top sprocket can help too, but I believe that the hex interface is your biggest source of backlash. If you have to run with hex shaft, definitely shim it, and check it fairly frequently for any twisting.",

Another way of reducing backlash in hex shaft joints is by pinning them all the way through - either cotter pins or bolts will do!\n\nYou could also probably do with a higher ratio on the MaxPlanetary gearbox (depending on what you’re running on at the moment), which would improve the holding torque your motors are providing.\n\nAnd to echo Ryan, pictures or CAD would also be helpful",

Over time, backlash will only get worse and destroy your parts, costing you both matches and money.\n\nHowever, during the time you’re stuck with backlash, using trapezoidal motion profiles helps immensely with reducing system wear and improving consistency and control. The quickest and easiest code fix code fix is to drop to a ProfiledPID , and start fiddling with values until performance is adequate, and crunchyness is minimized.\n\nA constrained, and relatively low acceleration will reduce the forces applied to the system while the hardware gets patched up. And then once backlash is removed… you can crank those numbers up for better performance.",

If so, this is the worst problem by far and I would try to switch to a zombie axle or deadaxle as live hex is susceptible to torsional deflection which sucks a ton. 1/2hex is just not stiff, so even if there was 0 backlash, you would get a ton of torsional deflection. Maxspline live or deadaxle, or round pipe deadaxle are significantly stiffer and will help a lot.\n\nI would also try to eliminate as many hex/hex interfaces as possible. Screwing chain directly into the arm or using a clamping mount will entirely eliminate backlash. Shim tape can help, but eliminating the problematic interface helps more.\n\nDepending on when your first or second event is, a custom gearbox can be used to have much less backlash than a maxplanetary. We’re late into build season tho, so this might not be an option.\n\nIs it also possible to post a video of the problematic arm?",

Not all teams have the resources to build them but a custom gearbox with 20DP gears allows  you to reduce the backlash down to absolutely minimum levels - especially with shim tape on your intermediate gearbox stages. If you do have the ability to build one, doing so with a long arm is a borderline necessity.",

Another BIG thing is the location of your feedback sensor.\n\nAre you using the built in motor encoder, or do you have an external encoder somewhere else. It’s hard to control a mechanism you don’t know the precise location of, and with lots of backlash, the difference between the expected location from a motor encoder and the actual location can be substantially different.\n\nTry to mount a feedback device directly onto the arm itself, or at least as close as you can. This will make controlling the precise location of the arm much easier.",

                    "cooked": "When it comes to arms you need to look at something called rotational stiffness. Rotational stifness is basically how stiff the arm is with its natural frequency. If the natrual frequency of the arm is in the 1 to 2 hertz range then thats the root of the oslotaion you really want to aim in the 5 to 7 hz range if its a single jointed arm but if its double jointed then aim for the 4 to 5hz range. My team had the same problem in 2023 with our double jointed arm and we even used a custom gearbox. In order to stiffen the arm,  Since your using chain your going to want to change it to No.35 if its no 25H chain because its way stiffer. Also custom gearbox and using green loctite or loctite 380 will also get you the same reslut as shim tape but its more permanite solution and will require a heat gun or blowtorch to get off. If your unsure still id recomend looking at 971 debrif on thier 2023 arm design and it will go over rotaion stifnees and what materials would improve it. I hope this helps",

I will upload some pics of the arm today.\n\nWe tried using a bigger sprocket and as predicted, it pretty much divided our rotational backlash by the ratio of the teeth between the sprockets.\n\nOut of the mentioned fixes, I’m leaning towards shim tape, removing the 90 degree gearbox (if necessary), and replacing the chain with a stiffer one. We have an absolute encoder and will be using it for feedback. We will do motion profiling for smoother travel.\n\nThese seem like the easiest changes to make before our week 1 event.\n\nAs for afterwards, if we don’t completely remove our arm in favor of a different design, we will most likely remove the live hex. I keep seeing deadaxle everywhere, but I’m not sure what it means.\n\nAnother question, can shim tape be used on a hex interface in a printed pulley? Can it be used on bearings on hex? Is it good for all hex interfaces?\n\nAre there any other easy ways to improve stiffness (that don’t involve redesign like using a custom gearbox)?",

They are extremely not stiff and wear fast, further exaggerating the problem of live hex, which is already incredibly bad and likely the #1 contributor to your stiffness issues. Using shim tape on them is rather pointless if they are under any load, as the next match, they would already have worn.\n\nDeadaxle is where the shaft remain fixed and the arm rotates around the shaft. In this setup, the shaft transmits 0 torque and therefore has no torsional deflection. Zombie axle is similar, but the shaft isn’t prevented from rotating, it just transmits 0 torque. Swapping to a zombie axle should be easy, as you just need to bolt the sprocket to the arm and now you avoid most of the hex shaft issues. I would suggest making this a very high priority, as no amount of driver skill or software can work around a robot that doesn’t do what it is told to do.",
