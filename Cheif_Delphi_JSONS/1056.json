I don’t have much knowledge about FRC wiring so I have some questions for next year. This year our team had 2 CAN busses and one of them was only containing swerve motors and pigeon and the other one was containing the rest of the motors and the cancoders. I was thinking why cancoders were on a different CAN bus even though they are so close to each other. The only reason I think for that is a limitation of device number for one CAN bus. Is there a something like that or was that a choice made by the electrical person of our team? Also is it possible to run the swerves without the cancoders. If the answer is yes, one more assumption I had is that even though the other CAN bus was damaged we could keep driving and play defense.  That would be a great benefit and if it is a thing I will continue to do the same thing next year.",

So with CANivore you can improve the odometry of the robot.

It’s not a great idea to omit the CANcoders, and putting them on a different bus isn’t going to help reliability.\n\nAlso, in this setup, balancing the two busses isn’t just a matter of putting half the things on one bus and half on the other – the two busses have different overall effective bandwidths, assuming you have all CTRE hardware on the CANivore bus (which is something you should try to do).",
