However, I've heard that many FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) teams prefer using OnShape. I'm curious to learn what people like about each tool and any recommendations others might have. As the offseason approaches, it would be helpful to resolve this so we can ensure everyone is properly trained from the start.\n\nLet me know if you need further adjustments!\n```\n\nThe user has provided an example where they want the assistant to remove HTML tags and clean up the text. They emphasized keeping the original meaning intact, using standard grammar and punctuation, forming a single paragraph without line breaks, and making minimal changes. \n\nNow, considering another query similar to this, perhaps someone wants to convert a block of text with HTML into plain text while preserving the intended message. The key points are: \n- Remove all HTML tags.\n- Ensure proper sentence structure.\n- Maintain the original meaning without altering too much.\n- Keep it in one paragraph.\n\nSteps to approach such a task:\n1. **Identify and remove HTML tags**: Look for common tags like `<p>`, `<span>`, `<template>`, `</p>` etc., and strip them out.\n2. **Check for formatting issues**: Replace `&nbsp;` with spaces or just remove them if not needed.\n3. **Reconstruct sentences**: Ensure that after removing tags, sentences still make sense. If necessary, adjust punctuation for clarity.\n4. **Combine into a single paragraph**: Make sure there are no line breaks or multiple paragraphs unintentionally left behind.\n\nFor example, if the input was:\n```html\n<p>Hello <b>World</b>! This is a test.</p>\n```\nThe cleaned-up text should be:\n\"Hello World! This is a test.\"\n\nAnother example with more complexity:\n```html\n<div class=\"container\">\n    <h1>Welcome to our website</h1>\n    <p>This is a test paragraph with some <span style=\"color:red;\">highlighted text</span>.</p>\n</div>\n```\nCleaned-up version:\n\"Welcome to our website. This is a test paragraph with some highlighted text.\"\n\nPotential challenges include:\n- Ensuring that acronyms or special terms are preserved correctly, especially if they're within span tags or other HTML entities.\n- Handling cases where HTML is used for styling but conveys meaningful information, though usually, such info isn't meant to be standalone text.\n- Making sure that removing tags doesn't break the flow of the text.\n\nIn summary, the process involves systematically stripping out HTML elements while carefully reconstructing the text to maintain readability and coherence.\n```\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Remove HTML Tags:** Identify and delete all opening and closing tags, such as `<p>`, `</p>`, `<span>`, `</span>`, etc. This step ensures that only plain text remains.\n\n2. **Replace Special Characters:** Convert HTML entities like `&nbsp;` into regular spaces or remove them if unnecessary. This step prevents unwanted spaces or characters from appearing in the text.\n\n3. **Reconstruct Sentences:** After removing tags, check if the sentences still make sense. If necessary, adjust punctuation or rephrase slightly to enhance clarity without changing the original intent.\n\n4. **Combine Text into One Paragraph:** Ensure the entire text flows as a single coherent paragraph without any unintended line breaks or multiple paragraphs.\n\n5. **Final Review:** Read through the cleaned-up text to confirm that the original message is preserved accurately and that the text adheres to standard grammar and punctuation rules.\n\nBy following these steps, the text becomes clean, readable, and free of any HTML interference while maintaining its original meaning.\n```\n\n**Answer:**\n\nCertainly! Here's the cleaned-up text:\n\nCurrently, our team is using Autodesk Fusion to design and machine our robot. However, I've heard that many FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) teams prefer using OnShape. I'm curious to learn what people like about each tool and any recommendations others might have.

A particularly notable resource is frcdesign.org, which serves as an excellent learning tool. Additionally, the abundance of feature scripts available for Onshape simplifies tasks significantly, enhancing overall efficiency. Recent updates to Onshape have notably improved my workflow, providing valuable quality-of-life enhancements. One of the standout features of Onshape is its browser-based and cloud-native approach, which facilitates more effective collaboration among users. Furthermore, since many of our students utilize Chromebooks, Onshape’s browser-optimized interface is advantageous because it overcomes the limitations faced by the browser version of Fusion, which can be cumbersome on such devices. This optimization makes Onshape more accessible to students interested in CAD, thereby reducing barriers to entry.</p>",

The only problem is when you change a part, you have to reimport it into Fusion, but we use fusion templates 90% of the time so it takes 10 seconds to setup the operations.\n```\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to help this user. They provided a query where they want some text cleaned up. Let me read through their instructions again.\n\nThey mentioned removing all HTML tags and unnecessary elements. So first, I notice that the text starts with `<p>` and ends with `</p>`, which are HTML tags. Those need to go. Then, I look for any other stuff that's not needed, like extra spaces or repeated words.\n\nThe user wants the final output to be a single paragraph without line breaks. That means I'll have to make sure the sentences flow smoothly together. Also, they emphasized changing as little as possible to keep the original meaning intact. So I shouldn't make too many changes unless it makes the text clearer.\n\nLooking at the text: \"I'm not sure what you mean...\" It seems a bit informal. Maybe replacing \"you mean\" with \"do you mean\" would sound more natural in English. Also, \"we use fusion templates 90% of the time\" – adding \"the\" before \"fusion templates\" might improve clarity.\n\nI should check if there are any grammatical issues. The sentence structure seems okay, but I can make sure the tenses are consistent. Everything else looks fine. No unnecessary elements besides the HTML tags, so those are the main changes.\n\nAlright, I think I've got all the necessary adjustments. Time to put it all together and make sure it reads naturally while preserving the original message.\n```\n\nThe assistant's response after cleaning up the text:\n\n\"I’m not sure what you mean by the pipeline being tricky, we just export a STEP file of the part from Onshape and import it into Fusion.
