Each tag pose is then transformed into field space on the rio and sent to the pose estimator individually.\n\nWhen calculating the translation of the robot from each tag we don’t use the tags’ orientation. We instead use the expected orientation using information from our gyro which helps us get useful poses from anywhere on the field.\n\nAfter running into occlusion issues with only having our main camera at our first comp we added two limelights that point to the left & right at an ~15-degree angle. They ensure that we always have a tag visible while we’re scoring and picking up game pieces.\n\nWe’re simply using the botpose the limelights output and applying them directly to our pose estimator. We found that the pose estimation degraded quickly once we moved too far away and throw out any poses when we’re > 4 meters away from a tag. It’s possible that the new camera calibration features would help significantly for this.\n\nWhile the button is held down control of the robot’s drivetrain is swapped to the robot code.\n\nWhen the button is initially pressed the robot requests the robot commands the robot to continue moving at the current  velocity. A path is then generated asynchronously taking the robot from the current position to the target goal.\n\nThe same button is used to line up to scoring nodes is also used to line up to pickup positions We first decide whether we want to go to a pickup position or scoring node based on which side of the field we’re on + some velocity based lookahead. Scoring The grid that we want to go is predicted based on the robot’s position + a velocity lookahead. Once the grid is determined the actual node we want to go to is based on what is selected on the operator’s button panel Pickup The normal left-paddle will auto lineup to the inner double-substation The right-bumper is used to line up to the outer double-substation We initially tried position and velocity based prediction for this, but it was too unpredictable for our driver\n\nWe first decide whether we want to go to a pickup position or scoring node based on which side of the field we’re on + some velocity based lookahead.

(This helps the robot drive a smoother S-curve)\n\nOther points are dynamically added in between the start and end position if needed to avoid the charging station.\n\nWe then pass this to WPILib’s trajectory generator to return a path the robot can drive.\n\nWe use the same path following code that we have for driving during the autonomous period.\n\nOnce the path is complete we have an additional position PID controller that is continually running.\n\nVision is continually correcting the position of the robot as it drives the path.\n\nThe same button is used to bring the mechanism up for scoring and double-substation pickup. The robot’s position on the field determines the which setpoint to go to\n\nThe robot’s position on the field determines the which setpoint to go to\n\nIn scoring the selected position on the button panel is also determines the setpoint to use.\n\nThe selected position also determines which piece mode to use which changes the strength of the grabber.\n\nEach of the mechanism’s control their position independently with their own PID controllers and feedforward to compensate for gravity.\n\nOur MechanismStateManager class converts setpoints represented as 2D coordinates into the 1D setpoints that each mechanism needs to go to. The MechanismStateManager also ensures we don’t command the mechanism past their limits and into field elements.\n\nThe MechanismStateManager also ensures we don’t command the mechanism past their limits and into field elements.\n\nIf you all have any questions about anything feel free to ask below and I’ll try my best to respond!",

For that we first tuned the PID portion, so it got to the target position as fast as possible and the configured the profile to achieve a balance between how fast we get to our target angle, and how much turning would slow down our robot while we drove a path.\n\nThe motion profiling part was something we played around with quite a lot throughout the season. Having it turn too quickly would cause us to fall behind on our trajectory (and then slam into the scoring nodes because the position PID is trying to catch us up), but if we were too slow we wouldn’t be done turning in time.\n\nFor our drive motors we only used feedforward to control the velocity of the robot. We would log our motor velocities/accelerations and then fit them to a line to get our feedforward values. We then ran our autos a bunch of times and hand tuned those values more until we were happy with them. We don’t actually have a way to input acceleration throughout our drive class, but we faked this in autos by calculating a velocity command that would give us acceleration equivalent to what we want.\n\nFor most of our other control loops we first figured out the appropriate constants to cancel out gravity (if needed) and then hand tuned our pid loops to act on top of them. Not having to worry about gravity really allowed us to push our pid loops to the maximum. (iirc our elevator ran at its maximum output power until we were within just a few centimeters of our goal position.) (You may still see some leftover motion profiles in our robot code, but these should all be disabled. Our robot loop jittered too much to have to be able to properly run the motion profile from the rio & we weren’t able to get the motion profiles to work properly on our sparks.)",
