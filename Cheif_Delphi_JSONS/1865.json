To learn more, check out the documentation or take a look at our conference from the 2025 FIRST Championship.\n\nAdvantageScope’s fifth season in 2026 marks an important transition as we begin looking to the future of a unified FRC and FTC control system with SystemCore . We’re humbled to watch the growth of AdvantageScope from less than 100 users in 2022 to almost 13,000 in 2025, and we look forward to working with new users as AdvantageScope becomes more closely integrated with FIRST Tech Challenge in the coming years. We appreciate everyone who has used AdvantageScope, given us feedback, reported bugs, or contributed code over the years.\n\nDespite future visions for control systems yet-to-come, we also have some exciting updates to share for the 2026 season! The 2026 release of AdvantageScope includes several major new features and numerous smaller enhancements across the application. You can find the full details on the What’s New in 2026? page of the documentation. We’ve also highlighted a few of our favorite additions below.\n\nThank you to all of the developers who contributed to this release, including @j5155 , @virtualkyle378 , @amsam0 , and @Kabinet .\n\nIn preparation for full support with SystemCore in the 2027-2028 season, this release adds several features to improve compatibility with the existing FIRST Tech Challenge control system:\n\nFTC fields and robot models on the 2D field and 3D field\n\nNew coordinate system options for compatibility with standard FTC coordinates\n\nSupport for Road Runner log files\n\nSupport for the FTC Dashboard live streaming format\n\nFTC teams should exercise caution when using beta/experimental software during the official season. More details regarding supported formats and compatibility can be found here .\n\nFTC Field 1920×575 91.5 KB\n\nFTC Field 1920×575 91.5 KB\n\nFTC Field 1920×575 91.5 KB\n\nThe line graph tab has been redesigned to be fully unit-aware. This enables several new capabilities when graphing numeric fields:\n\nPrecise labeling of Y axes and value displays\n\nQuick conversion to compatible units (no popup windows)\n\nImplicit conversion of compatible unit types within a single axis\n\nAccurate display of integrated and differentiated units\n\nThe screenshot below shows all of these features in action. Note that the left axis includes fields with different angular velocity units, and the right axis includes values that are differentiated and displayed in a non-native unit (degrees). Selecting units is also easier than ever before, with compatible unit options integrated directly in the control menu for each axis.\n\nMore information about unit support can be found in the documentation .\n\nUnit-aware graphing 2040×1432 694 KB\n\nUnit-aware graphing 2040×1432 694 KB\n\nUnit-aware graphing 2040×1432 694 KB\n\nDownloading logs from the roboRIO is now 2-4x faster than previous releases. This is accomplished by switching to a new protocol (FTP) that allows the roboRIO to transfer log data with less CPU overhead.\n\nThe table below shows the measured transfer speed on the 2025 and 2026 releases of AdvantageScope while tethered via Ethernet (max bandwidth of 100 Mb/s). Note that the performance of the 2025 release is severely impacted by the CPU load on the roboRIO.\n\n2025 (SFTP) 2026 (FTP) Speedup High CPU load 25 Mb/s 80 Mb/s 3.2x Average CPU load 40 Mb/s 90 Mb/s 2.3x Minimal CPU load 90 Mb/s 95 Mb/s 1.1x\n\nSeveral new visualization options are supported on the 2D field and 3D field:\n\nA wider variety of robot bumper colors are now available on the 2D field, and each object can be configured with its own color. This enables greater flexibility when combining ghosts with multiple robot objects.\n\nWhen visualizing 2D mechanisms on the 3D field, mechanisms can now be placed on the YZ plane in addition to the XZ plane. This enables easier visualization of complex mechanisms with movement in multiple axes.\n\nNew field visualization 1920×911 119 KB\n\nNew field visualization 1920×911 119 KB\n\nNew field visualization 1920×911 119 KB\n\nFor more flexible visualization of data produced outside of robot logging frameworks, AdvantageScope now includes basic support for importing CSV files. Check the documentation for more details on supported formats and other limitations.\n\nCSV data 2188×974 103 KB\n\nCSV data 2188×974 103 KB\n\nCSV data 2188×974 103 KB\n\nThe AdvantageScope UI on Windows 11 has been updated to support a translucent sidebar, which was previously exclusive to macOS releases (after a short-lived beta release on Windows last year). An updated app icon is also available for macOS Tahoe based on Apple’s Liquid Glass material.\n\nWindows UI 1198×686 111 KB\n\nWindows UI 1198×686 111 KB\n\nWindows UI 1198×686 111 KB\n\nThe menu bar and related controls have been streamlined and reorganized to make the controls more accessible and consistent across all platforms. Notable features include:\n\nFaster switching between live sources (e.g. NetworkTables and Phoenix Diagnostics), with no need to open the preferences window.\n\nRight-click on the sidebar to quickly copy the name of a field (or the full field key).\n\nReorganization of the preferences window, making options easier to find quickly.\n\nStreamlined menus 1189×747 144 KB\n\nStreamlined menus 1189×747 144 KB\n\nStreamlined menus 1189×747 144 KB\n\nThe AdvantageScope 2026 beta is now released! You can download it from the GitHub releases page by finding the first release with version v26.0.0-beta-X . We welcome feedback, feature requests, or bug reports on the GitHub issues page .\n\nTHIS IS A BETA RELEASE , which means that you will encounter issues not present in stable releases. We rely on your feedback and bug reports to make AdvantageScope better for everyone. Keep an eye out for updates, and we look forward to seeing what all of you do with AdvantageScope in 2026 and beyond!",

One thing that could really make our lives easier is some functionality to make it easier to switch between live Network Tables data and logged data.  It’s unfortunately a lot of overhead to set to useful tables and other visualizations, only to have them work in only one of the environments.

I’d be happen to explain our use case.\n\nI think you are referring to pulling information from Network Tables, and being able to do so either from a live connection or from log files.  However, I’m referring to a use case where information is always logged to files, but only sent via Network Tables for purposes of live debugging when practicing, etc.  Upon reflection, I realize that of course just because we do it that way doesn’t mean that everyone works that way, so please allow me to explain our setup for a moment.\n\nWe do our logging through DogLog , which is really just a front-end to WPILib logging, but one that enabled us to easily and broadly log large amounts of robot data, which – when combined with AdvantageScope – has been transformative for us (and for which we are tremendously grateful to @jonahsnider , sometimes affectionately known as “other Jonah” ).  When we practice in our facility, we use DogLog’s withNtPublish option to publish what’s logged over Network Tables.  However, when competing, because we will not be interactively looking at such data, we disable the publishing over Network Tables, limiting the load on the Rio and preserving network bandwidth.  Therefore, when looking at the log files from competition matches, the same data is there (plus a bit more, such as joystick controls, etc.), but the data that we were accessing through Network Tables is now available at a different (storage-based) path.  Therefore, any useful tables, graphs, etc. that we’ve saved from our time working interactively with the Network Tables data need to be re-setup for the paths on the logged (non-NT) data.\n\nPerhaps our paradigm could be improved.  I’d also be open to suggested alternative ways of working, instead of looking for a tooling change for our current paradigm, which perhaps might not be as common as we would initially presume.",

The default behavior for all of these clients is to only subscribe to data that they are actively using, so any additional telemetry fields published to NetworkTables won’t be transmitted at all when running in a competition configuration. The CPU performance of NetworkTables should also be less of a concern with DogLog compared to the raw NT API since the data is being sent to NT via a background thread.\n\nI think the fundamental issue here is that DogLog uses a unique architecture for publishing data (manually copying data to both NT and WPILOG), but operates on top of other systems that already have a standardized behavior (DataLogManager). AdvantageScope is primarily designed to either deal with these standardized logging structures OR completely unique architectures that don’t have any overlap with other systems (e.g. AdvantageKit, Phoenix). DogLog straddles the line between these in a way that makes it challenging to cleanly support. We can sometimes approach a problem like this by adding more options , but we always try to make AdvantageScope “correct by default” unless we have no other choice. Even users of AdvantageKit (where the distinction from standard frameworks is more clear) sometimes struggle to take advantage of AdvantageScope’s integration options.\n\nOne easy solution from the DogLog side would be to simply record DataLog values with a NT: prefix directly, which matches the standard structure used by DataLogManager logs. I also think there’s some potential for simplification here given the diminishing benefits to publishing log-only values in the first place.",
