Now, since the last update, we have been unable to use limelight with photonvision. https://photonvision.local/ also will not connect. Everything is imaged & up to date, team number is set, we can see the limelight stream using limelight finder, just won’t connect to photonvision. We’ve seen some threads that say we need a network switch on the radio, is this the case?",

We use limelights every year, but the lead programmers graduated last year, so we are inexperienced with it. We are using photonvision with the limelight, so we aren’t using the  limelight software, correct? We plan on using a Logitech C920x Webcam, I’m not sure if that’s the exact model, but I believe it is. We haven’t set that up yet, but from what we’ve seen online, we will need to connect that to a Raspberry Pi, right? Also, since the limelight is considered a coprocessor, we don’t need to connect it to anything besides the PDB & radio, right?",

I’m no expert at LL or PhotonVision but have used both and our own custom software for years. I’ll try to answer but do try out your vision soon.\n\nNimble:\n\nphotonvision with the limelight, so we aren’t using the limelight software, correct?\n\nYes, if you load PhotonVision software instead of the LL software on the LL hardware.  Either software works well - pick the features best for you - so I don’t have to tell you which one my team is leaning toward but haven’t finalized.\n\nNimble:\n\nLogitech C920x Webcam\n\nBe careful of any Logitech on any of the Linux boxes. All my use of them had them usually  initially fail by displaying only speckles and it required unplugging and re-plugging the camera to get them to work. You can’t be doing that during a match! I don’t (usually) argue with success so if yours work - great.\n\nNimble:\n\nconnect that to a Raspberry Pi\n\nI never got Logitech to work reliably on any RPi - WPILibPi, my own program, LL , PhotonVision. If anyone knows the secret to success, I’m all ears! You have to try this to see what works for you.\n\nNimble:\n\nlimelight is considered a coprocessor, we don’t need to connect it to anything besides the PDB & radio\n\nLargely true, but…\n\nI wonder what else it could be considered but I guess that doesn’t matter.\n\nFrom my teams experience (school of hard-knocks education or we lost some matches not doing this) we believe the best practice for reliable connection is that espoused by many great CD contributors as “ use a switch .”\n\nPlug all Ethernets into a switch (roboRIO, radio, co-processors, etc.) If you are not familiar with POE be aware your switch probably will smoke if you put the power side of cable into it (YMMV). (You could ask me how bad that smells as I happen to know the answer to that question.) And don’t mix up the radio POE if you use it (you have a couple of choices on that and the Rev power injector is best for us) and the LL POE if you power it that way (we do and like the ease and reliability.\n\nAlso pay attention to what the power spec is for the switch. We went with the BrainBox often (but not always) recommended on CD . It, too, plugs into your version of a PDP (I presume that’s what you meant by PDB) without any other power regulating devices needed.",
