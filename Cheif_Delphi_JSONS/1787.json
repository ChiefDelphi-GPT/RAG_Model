I believe it does have some practical use cases in FRC for quickly getting AI Models from data that would usually exist on full FRC Field that some people might not have access to. In the future I’ll likely experiment to see how good it is for simulating robots for my dream goal of a fully autonomous robot .\n\nYou can generate synthetic data in various formats to do things such as\n\nObject pose estimation with DOPE (Deep Object Pose Estimation)\n\nObject detection through various methods such as YOLO\n\nvSLAM\n\nSo much more\n\nNote: the rest of this is kinda a very very bare-bones tutorial if you’re looking at seeing what you can do and getting started\n\nFor some prerequisites you should look here\n\nTo get started you have to install the Omniverse Launcher, then you’ll have to install Isaac Sim, and I think that version 4.1.0 is a little bit better just because of a bug in 4.2.0 that might make it hard to make custom materials. Even though you’ll likely need some programming experience in python, if you have experience in any other language it’ll likely not be too difficult for the light amount of code in python that you might write.\n\nHere you can drag a model of various potential fields to test the game on for me I wanted to play around with generating synthetic data for a real field for 2025, so after importing the Reefscape Field model I had to play around with the materials (and still do a bit to get the most authentic feel)\n\nThen I selected all the coral and all the algae and gave them semantics so when generating synthetic data it’ll know what is what.\n\nThen in a folder in vscode I created a little workspace that I called reefscape_sim which has a .vscode/ folder that is fairly close to the one in C:\\Users\\*user*\\AppData\\Local\\ov\\pkg\\isaac-sim-4.1.0\\.vscode with some slight modifications so that I can have intellisense while I’m working.\n\nThen my python code to generate some synthetic data follows as such:\n\nAfterwords for training a YOLO based model I take the data from my output folder and put it into a training workspace that I then run a script to convert all my Kitti data to YOLO. Finally i run a train.py script as such:\n\nwith the conf.yaml of:\n\nNote: in the process before running the train.py it is likely fairly important to add some various real data to mix in with the synthetic ones (although I personally I have not yet). For me I would likely look at Collections: First Robotics Competition dataset; the robot one specifically to mix in. from synodic.ai This is because as you can see in the gif it sometimes detects various other objects with only a single location for the images.\n\nNote: This gif is significantly slowed down Note_2: This was tested with Vision Detector on iOS by converting the YOLOv8s model to CoreML\n\nSince I’m on a Windows machine I had to use WSL to convert the YOLO model to CoreML. The process followed as such:\n\nDownload python and install the ultralytics library if not installed yet\n\nMove the best.pt model to a folder in WSL.\n\nCreate a python file, in which I named conv.py\n\nIn the python file write the following and run:\n\nMove to best.mlpackage to iPhone through various means for use with Vision Detector\n\nI’m still kinda new to using Omniverse and there’s more to this but I thought to bring this to light to the best of my ability cause I found this really cool.\n\nI think it’ll be a good offseason project or potentially even during the season if you have spare time. Although I love Omniverse and Isaac Sim I would say that the documentation is kind of sparse. There may be some issues that you’ll come into that I didn’t mention in this post but I’ll be glad to try to help anyone if you get stuck. :3",

Also, how does the data compare to real-world data?  I know in real-world applications, there’s likely going to be a lot more variance in terms of lighting conditions, so I’m wondering if that’s going to be account for here.  I’m also creating a dataset of pictures on roboflow that you might be interested in.",

I can say that it will almost definitely work IRL, although I’m still likely gonna have to experiment with it more when I have the time.\n\nThe great thing about Omniverse is that you can always add more code to randomize things even further. Various types of lighting, obscure camera angles, cameraFocusDistance, cameraFocalLength, cameraAperture, the materials of any object, you can randomize the environment to instead of a normal field you could have any object in a factory, hospital, office, etc… you could sprinkle in a variety of misc. props. Although you can also add various humans into your scene I think that it’ll likely be better through real data just because programmatically posing humans might be strange although I haven’t played with it too much yet. TLDR: Omniverse has the ability to programmatically change pretty much anything to create a large variety of photos\n\nI think where Omniverse really excels is by allowing you to capture more than just a bounding box of the object. For instance they have a way to accurately detect the pose of an object using Deep Object Pose Estimation or CenterPose, which might be better for exacting the position of things, which could include robots and game pieces. Moreover there’s just some things that those who don’t have a real field won’t be able to get many images of. Looking at The Zebracorns (Team 900). I think they use some sort of SLAM localization, so being able to track any element on the field might be helpful there.\n\nimage 1920×1140 138 KB\n\nimage 1920×1140 138 KB\n\nimage 1920×1140 138 KB\n\nBy next Tuesday I’ll hope to have trained a more silly model to detect more information about the game objects such as which level the coral is on (if it is on a reef) and potentially it’s orientation.\n\nAlso I really appreciate the dataset, I will likely be using using this as the test dataset to check progress thank you! :3",
