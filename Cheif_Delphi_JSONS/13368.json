                    "cooked": "I would like to use the simulation facilities in WPILib to help my team develop largely without the use of the robot. The first goal is to allow code developed to go essentially unchanged onto the robot itself. I see many quick examples of simulation and read the docs. Either I am having trouble orienting myself or there is a misalignment with my intent and the present state of WPILib.\n\nI would expect some configuration to cause the HAL to direct calls to synthetic elements instead of actual device drivers. There would be some central simulated robot state so these synthetic elements could give coherent responses. It would be nice if the simulation state also captured physics and environment as well. I would anticipate this requiring explicit HAL use for device access. This would extend to team-developed drivers for devices through MXP and CAN.\n\nGoals (in order of increasing ambition):\n\nWhole system development without the robot\n\nExpectation unit testing where mock/simulated elements can be queried. e.g. The robot transitioned from State1 to State2, did the motors run?\n\nVision system development where the synthetic robot orientation drives the camera/viewport of a 3d model of the field.\n\nPre-integration collaboration where subteams exchange mocks of their system before developing the actual versions.\n\nAnalysis-of-alternatives investigation where different hardware can be evaluated in simulation",

It seems like the most natural thing to do with WPILib is not that, though: instead both the “robot” and “physics” domains are mixed together on the “robot” side.  I found it most natural for simulation code to wind up everywhere (example: my swerve sim thing .\n\nI think there are good reasons why it works this way – beginner programmers have just one thing to learn, it works the same in java and c++ – but i think it could also work the way you and i expect.  If anyone is working in that direction, I’d be interested in learning more about it, maybe helping out if that would be useful.",

The simulation HAL is used any time you run robot code on the desktop.\n\nIn addition to the RoboRIO actual hardware functions, the HAL also supports simulation-focused virtual devices (SimDevice) that provide a way to access higher level functionality in simulation–for example, rather than needing to mock the SPI layer of gyros, a Gyro class in WPILib creates a SimDevice in simulation that just provides direct access to the gyro rate and angle.\n\nThe simulation HAL also supports plugins, so e.g. the simulation GUI is a plugin that displays a GUI and uses the simulation HAL functions to change HAL values seen or set by the robot program.  There’s also a WebSockets plugin so you can use any language to talk to the simulated HAL.\n\nThe simulation HAL functionality is exposed via both the low level HAL functions and higher-level WPILib “Sim” classes.\n\nCode construction wise, yes, the typical approach is to write code into simulationPeriodic() functions that is the sim analogue of the “normal” robotPeriodic(), but that’s certainly not the only way to do it.  You could write separate classes, or even run a completely separate application and talk to the simulation HAL via websockets instead.\n\nYou can find more information in the WPILib docs under “Robot Simulation” regarding both physics simulation and unit testing.\n\nIntroduction to Robot Simulation, Simulation Specific User Interface Elements, Glass Widgets, Widgets for the Command-Based Framework, The Field2d Widget, Plots, Physics Simulation with WPILib, Dev...",

Our team is working in Java, and I’d be happy to help with an effort in this direction if someone can provide support and review on the nuts and bolts in the robotics libraries.",

Hardware calls go to the real HAL on the RIO, and to the simulation HAL (ie HALSIM) on other platforms. The library handles all this under the hood, and exposes functions such as RobotBase.isSimulation() to check and methods that are run only in sim such as simulationPeriodic() for simulation-specific user code.\n\nPhysics simulation classes such as ElevatorSim use physical constants to simulate mechanism responses to applied voltage. These constants can be derived from CAD, determined using SysID (if the robot is already built), or set arbitrarily to reasonable values (the latter will require retuning of other constants once running on the real robot, as the simulation physics model wouldn’t be accurate). The responses from the physics simulation can be fed into hardware simulation classes that provide a way to set sensor values etc. Hardware simulation objects can also be used in unit tests to query hardware state without adding a ton of getters to the tested code.\n\nThe rationale for having simulation-specific code in the same source set as “regular” code is that often said simulation-specific code needs access to subsystem internals and such.",

If you wanted to handle the HAL simulation layer completely separately, that is something that would work perfectly fine today. Its how the sim gui plugins work, but you don’t have to write it as a plugin to properly work. You could always just fire up another thread that only talks sim calls.\n\nIn general, the choice for the documentation and examples to combine the sim side and robot code side is out of convenience. Completely separating everything is complex, and while there are cases where it could be better, generally for most teams it seems like mixing the systems works well enough.",

So the “typical approach” is good for that reason.\n\nSo I think if we were going to do anything else (e.g . the websockets approach), it would end up to be “mentor-ware”.  I’ve ruminated on that too: the field elements are mentor-built, so maybe the physics model could also be mentor-built, and deliver the value of simulation to the students without embroiling them in the complexities of supporting it.  But I dunno, I also really like the students to be able to understand everything that they touch, all the way to the metal.  And i think there are real issues there – how does closed-source CAN-based stuff work with the websockets approach?\n\nAnyway, still interested in exploring a more segmented approach, but i don’t think it’s easy.

I entirely understand providing an escape hatch for the robot code to change function when running in simulation but the docs/examples would lead me to believe that it is the primary mode of operation.\n\nIt would help me a lot if there was a simple, but not empty, example that includes regular robot code that is largely unaware that it is running on real or simulated code and then a separate section of code that handles simulation. For my purposes, I would like that in C++ but I can handle Java as long as it aligns with the C++ calls. I appreciate that the examples are focused on single topics for when I am looking for a specific topic.

We structure our subsystems to isolate hardware interaction to an “IO layer” with multiple implementations. This allows us to swap out real hardware for the WPILib physics sim classes while bypassing vendor libraries (or write multiple “real” implementations for robots with different hardware). The main control logic doesn’t need to know which IO implementation is being used. This structure also interfaces with our AdvantageKit logging framework to enable more advanced features, but we started using IO layers for simulation before AdvantageKit existed.

However, we’ve found it easier to deal with small interfaces for each subsystem that we have full control over, and it clearly enforces a separation in our code between control logic and “hardware” (though this isn’t impossible with the HAL approach). The IO layers are also more flexible when we need more than one “real” or “sim” implementation. Ultimately either approach is reasonable, so it mostly comes down to personal preference.\n\n(Also we prefer not relying on vendors to provide robust simulation support.)",

GitHub - frc1444/robot2019-sim: Our robot code from 2019 ported to robo-sim and GitHub - frc1444/robot2020: Our robot code for Infinite Recharge that utilizes robo-sim . Both used a library I developed called GitHub - frc1444/robo-sim: A 2D simulation and abstraction of WPILib code for FRC .\n\nThe main idea is the same as @jonahb55 talked about in their post, although I think we did the implementation a bit different. We ended up using multiple gradle modules. One module had code that ONLY ran on the robot ( wpi ), which imported WPILib code, one module had the core of our code that ran in both the simulation and on the robot ( core ), and one module was only for the simulation ( gdx ). We used lots of dependency inversion since the wpi module imported the core module and the gdx module also imported the core module.\n\nIn my opinion, the end result was a lot cleaner than global simulation state and none of the simulation code had references to things like MotorControllers. However, I was the only person on the team that understood what the code was doing and it’s really hard to teach new students to create an interface (inside core ), then create two separate implementations of said interface (in wpi and gdx ). It was an elegant design, but teaching it was difficult.\n\nI personally don’t really like the simulation approach that WPILib takes, because it seems to combine simulation code and non-simulation code side by side with if statements, but I don’t have a better solution to recommend that’s easy to teach. Since I couldn’t teach it and there wasn’t documentation for it, we didn’t use my simulation stuff in 2022 since college was keeping me busy.\n\nHere’s the thread from two years ago: RoboSim: A LibGDX robot code simulator\n\nI think in 2020 our code hit on some of your points. We simulated vision data in a very similar manner that the robot reported data to us and since there wasn’t global state everywhere, many unit tests were possible.",

                    "cooked": "AronRubin:\n\nGoals …\n\nOne thing I find useful is to break down “Simulation Facilities” into its components. This should in turn help understand the best way to achieve the goals.\n\nStarting with the idea that “Simulation” equals “get robot-like functionality without a robot”, there’s a few steps involved:\n\nSince the robot isn’t present, presumably, you need the code you wrote to be built so it can run on a different CPU architecture.\n\nWPILib fully supports this.\n\nPresumably, the robot-specific IO is not present. This means the code, at some point, will reference hardware which doesn’t exist, and break in one way or another.\n\nA minimum viable product involves “stubbing out” all IO related functionality, so it simply returns “0” or “happy”. This will allow the code to at least start to execute on the alternate target.\n\nThis step is often referred to as choosing your “boundary diagram” for simulation. That is to say - choosing what’s in scope to be “same code as robot”, and what’s “sim-specific functionality”. The end usage goals are the primary input to determining what the appropriate boundary diagram(s) are.\n\nWPILib supports this at the HAL layer, and at some other “engineering units” sim layers, as Peter mentioned. Other teams have picked slightly different layers. Again, the correct answer here is highly dependent on end use case.\n\nRather than simply stubbing IO, the ones that you care about might need to be manipulated. This is purely for functionality checkout - IE, get certain lines of code to run. Inputs are manually set, outputs are manually checked.\n\nA simple unit test infrastructure could provide the input and check the outputs. However, all testcases would still be “hand-maintained” to ensure they represent realistic-enough IO to test the right lines of code. And, again, depending on the goals, this may be enough to achieve them.\n\nWPILib supports this through the same layers mentioned above, along with build infrastructure to define and run unit test cases.\n\nRather than manually maintaining inputs and outputs which are just “good enough to hit the right line of code”, you could instead write down simple relationships between how you expect your inputs to change when your outputs have certain values. This isn’t yet modeling exact physics, but rather reducing the manual developer burden to maintain true “open-loop” test cases.\n\nIt could be as simple as “when voltage is > 0, speed should increase”. Again, the goal here is simply to get the right lines of code activated, while minimizing the developer burden.\n\nWPILib supports sim-specific code entrypoints where you can write code to achieve this functionality. It also supports some device simulation classes that add in these behaviors.\n\nA further, orthogonal step is to make that sim-specific code not just “good enough to get the right lines of code activated”, but also to ensure the code output → code input relationships are physics accurate . That is to say - they accurately model your specific robot’s actual behavior.\n\nThis is a big step forward - it has very little to do with anything done previously, and is much more dependent on your ability to model a physical system accurately. It can add a lot in terms of checking alternatives in designs, but (in my experience) does fairly little for your ability to test your software well.\n\nWPILib’s mechanism simulation classes, when paired with proper data capture and analysis, can help achieve this.\n\nWPILib “supports simulation” to the extent that most of the key building blocks to physically model a robot+software system in a desktop environment are present. However, the onus is still on end teams to stitch them together in a way that achieves their goals.\n\nHere’s some of my thoughts on the goals you provided, at least as I understand them:\n\n“Unit testing” is actually your easiest goal to achieve. Pre-integration collaboration would be the next easiest. They require cross-compiling and poking at certain IO points, but neither requires closed-loop behavior to start.\n\nWhole-system development (implying robot+software) and vision system testing would be the next hardest. In addition to some potentially-custom bits for the vision side, both seem to need some level of closed-loop modeling of robot behavior.\n\nAnalysis-of-alternatives is the most challenging. Not only do you have to have closed-loop models, but you have to trust their accuracy enough to drive design decisions.",

Once you figure it out, it makes a lot of sense.\n\nHowever, I really don’t like having simulationPeriodic and mixing your simulation/real code – and even after moving to wrapping WPILibC I’ve hidden it away from users. Instead, in RobotPy we have a physics.py which is only loaded in simulation. A very simple example of this sort of thing is in our examples repo: examples/physics-4wheel/src at main · robotpy/examples · GitHub . A more involved example would be my team’s 2022 code ( 2022-robot/robot at main · frc6367/2022-robot · GitHub ).\n\nI believe I advocated for this type of split instead when simulationPeriodic et al was introduced, but there’s a number of factors that make it a lot harder to do in C++/Java (particularly C++).",
