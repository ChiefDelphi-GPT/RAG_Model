In the constructor of C, CG is created and a series of other commands (including a ParallelCommandGroup PG) are added to CG. Later when C is scheduled, in it’s initialize function, I call CG.schedule(). In the C.end() function, if interrupted is true, I call CG.cancel() expecting all commands in CG to end. C.isFinished watches CG.isScheduled() to determine when all the commands in CG have completed.\n\nThis works in that the robot behaves as expected. However, an unexpected driver action led to an unexpected robot behavior which led me to increase tracing and look at C’s execution in detail. What I found is C had a subsystem required that is also required in one of the commands added to CG. At scheduling, this causes C to be interrupted immediately. I see C.end(true) being called, this calls CG.cancel(). However, the commands in CG continue to run to completion of the command group.\n\nSo with the required subsystem error present, the cancel did not kill the command group. If it had, we would have found this issue last season. But, because the command group continued to execute, the robot did what was expected despite the error and we were none the wiser until now.",

This means that C.end() is called before CG.isScheduled() returns true and CG.cancel() therefore has no effect.  This behaviour by the scheduler is necessary in order to preserve the invariant that two commands with the same requirement are not scheduled at the same time.\n\nA simple fix would be to remove the subsystem from C. A more complex fix would be to reorganise the code so that it does not call schedule and cancel .  This is a little under-tested, but I sketched out a possible approach for creating commands on initialize .",
