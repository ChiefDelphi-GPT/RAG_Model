Our Limelight will be looking down at the cone with a birds eye view so to speak. My question is how exactly do we gather the orientation based off what the limelight sees?\n\nTake an image like this (This cone isnt tipped I just couldnt take a pic of a tipped cone at the moment) for example, would it be possible to gather the x, y coordinates of the corners of the green rectangle and then use math to find out its orientation? I know that limelight has an enable raw corners option but its all very unfamiliar to me. Furthermore if anyone has any ideas or suggestions on how to get this into code that would also be greatly appreciated.",

                    "cooked": "Disclaimer: I got too invested in the idea and ended up writing out all my thoughts and ideas towards the end, so it got a little long.\n\nAfter looking at the Limelight [Networktable docs], you were right that limelight has a corners option. ( Complete NetworkTables API — Limelight 1.0 documentation ), it looks like you need to enable “send contours” in the limelight config page and then you can access the coordinates through Network tables just like your tx and ty using tcornxy: \tNumber array of corner coordinates [x0,y0,x1,y1……] .\n\nShould be able to get the values with something like this… (Assuming Java, but C++ shouldn’t be too different)\n\nand then you can grab each individual corner with (Variable names do not matter - Choose whatever you see fit)\n\nAs for the math required to calculate the orientation, our team was planning on getting the length and width of the targeting rectangle straight from NetworkTables’s tvert and thor and based on the aspect ratio of that, determine whether cones are tipped or upright ( Never got that far so I cannot say if it would work ).\n\nSince limelight only produce 2 dimensional targeting on cones (Or at least to my knowledge) , I’m really racking my head trying to figure out a more robust method. If only the cones had an april tag painted on them. Then we all could use the 3d mode and get exact angles without any processing. EDIT: The corners (Which I believe is the red blotches) do wrap the 3d form, so this statement is fairly null and void but I’ll keep it in cause why not. It was confusing me on why the tcornxy had a … at the end of Y2, since a rectangle can only ever have four corners. But if it is the red like I am  thinking, then that makes everything a lot more accurate. I won’t say simpler, but it should lead to a way better solution then using the 2d rectangle).\n\nOnly thing I can think of is getting that aspect ratio and creating some kind of value table for x and y in relation to its orientation. Pretty much get the ratio for standing, and then perfectly lined up but lying down. Then you can throw some half way values in there like 45 degrees off  and then interpolate the rest to save time (Unless you got the manpower to do a lot of values, then have at it). With that, it should be able to know the angle based on aspect ratio and adjust accordingly.\n\nThe problem with this method is it won’t be able to distinguish from pointy end facing the robot or away from it. Which for pretty much every robot I have seen will definitely cause problems grabbing. Only way I can think of a work around using just limelight and not some GRIP or OpenCV machine learning algorithm based tracking is to somehow light the shot with some headlights or something and determine the size of the brightest yellow pixels, which should be noticeable since it will either be a large hollow square shape or small hollow circle. EDIT: I forgot you had mentioned it will be similar to a bird’s eye view, so lighting from the ground may not have any effect since it will be catching all the reflections from overhead lights.\n\nActually, looking at the image provided, the red markers seem to be following the blob rather than the rectangle, so using the distance between each upper and lower pair and finding the smallest distance should lead to identifying where the tip of the cone is. This should be pretty reliable since the camera is so high up it can see both sides clearly when when tipped. Just need to make sure the thresholding on getting the cone is dialed since the far side of the cone may appear darker or even in shadow at times which may throw off where it places the red corner marks.\n\nIf I keep typing any longer I’ll probably think in circles so I’ll call it here. Hope my rambling of ideas may spark some of your own and lead to a functioning method. I wish you good like and thank you for your time if you made it this far.",
