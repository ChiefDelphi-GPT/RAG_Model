I’ve seen some team like 6081, and 503 and was wondering how its worked for you guys compared to mounting it facing up. Questions I have about it:\n\nhow much pre planning did it take\n\ndo you find it easier to wire\n\nhow is cable management with it compared to conventional\n\nwould you say its easier to work on in the pits",

We put our electrical board on top of our frame 2x1s, and then the electrical components face downward.\n\nThere is nothing taller than 2\",so you can  screw a normal belly pan on.  We use polycarbonate as the belly pan so you can see the components for a quick check.\n\nThe real benefits are servicing.  You have easy access to everything, and don’t have to stuff your hands in between various mechanisms to reach stuff.\n\nIt is critically important, however, that you label all your wires at each connection point.  Because they travel from top to underneath, they can be impossible to trace quickly… If you have a motor not getting power, you want to be able to flip the robot and know exactly which wire it is plugged into the pdh.\n\nI would say this should always be best practice, but you can get away with a little less care when you can see the whole wire run.\n\nAlso, depending on how you terminate your wiring, you can put yourself in a situation where you can’t get the termination (Anderson powerpole for example)  back through the hole for the wire because the termination is bigger than the hole.\n\nAll in all, I can’t think of a good reason not to go with inverted electronics.  Make sure you hot glue everything as well.",

In the past we dealt with this by putting the rio on the hinging bottom bellypan piece right side up, however we decided to stick it above the bellypan space on an empty area on the surface  of the robot on a raised platform for impact resistance, ease of access, and so it wouldnt be on a moving part this year and that worked out pretty well.\n\nOverall we’re pretty happy with at least this portion of how we do our electronics and would recommend others do the same.",

We also countersink the bolts on our inverted bellypan to keep the top flat is there is a sub system up there. This also allows us to mount stuff on the top of the belly pan as well. Which is where we put the PIs on our '24 robot.\n\n2. do you find it easier to wire Yes, as it prevents the need to wire around subsystems, it also allows us to work quicker at competitions as our electronics are fully exposed once we removed the polycarbonate cover panel\n\n3. how is cable management with it compared to conventional About the same, we continue to label all the connections to help with diagnostics\n\n4. would you say its easier to work on in the pits Yes, especially with the smaller robots. In '23 we tried to do a hybrid electrical panel, with 2 upward facing and 1 inverted to make it easier for the FTA to see the RoboRio, and the upward facing compartments were almost unserviceable",

I’ve certainly seen non-inverted setups where the PDP / PDH was hidden under a mechanism or had other electronics stuck on top of it that made it very hard to inspect.  I’m just trying to point out a couple of avoidable inspection problems that an inverted setup might introduce.\n\nAs a specific example of potential issues with an inverted setup, the RI must trace the power wiring for the roboRIO [1] , the radio [2] , PCM /PH [3] , and any linear actuators [4] .  If this wiring passes through holes in the belly pan, then each trace potentially requires two flips.  A few minutes with a labeller can make inspection much more efficient.\n\nroboRIO is restricted to 10A on an unswitched fused channel. ↩︎\n\nroboRIO is restricted to 10A on an unswitched fused channel. ↩︎\n\nI am hopeful that radio power problems will be far less common with the new radios, but there are still ways to connect it wrongly, and I anticipate that there will still be a current restriction on the circuit so the fuse/breaker will still need to be checked. ↩︎\n\nI am hopeful that radio power problems will be far less common with the new radios, but there are still ways to connect it wrongly, and I anticipate that there will still be a current restriction on the circuit so the fuse/breaker will still need to be checked. ↩︎\n\nPCM /PH is restricted to 20A fuse or breaker and is the only circumstance under which a PDH fused channel can exceed 15A. ↩︎\n\nPCM /PH is restricted to 20A fuse or breaker and is the only circumstance under which a PDH fused channel can exceed 15A. ↩︎\n\nLinear actuators are restricted to 20A breaker regardless of wire gauge. ↩︎\n\nLinear actuators are restricted to 20A breaker regardless of wire gauge. ↩︎",

I have seen breakers fall out…\n\nSpeaking of this, I discovered that it is possible to insert your breakers with their connection tabs on the outside of the connector in the PDH .  I discovered this when I found a breaker that was so very wobbly when the rest were quite firm.  I suspect if the PDH was mounted upside down, it would have fallen right out in motion (which might have been a good thing – turning a confusing intermittent issue into an immediately apparent issue – as long as it happened in practice, anyway).",

Saw that the motor controller was not powered.  Tracing back to the PDH , noticed that the breaker was a little crooked and wobbly.\n\nIt clicked right away what had happened and it was so funny.  I had to shout over for our rookie pit student who had placed the breaker to show them and they received a little light ribbing about it.  I take some blame for not checking their work.  So now we know that it isn’t hard to do and that you have to make sure you are feeling some resistance to pushing the breaker in and that they aren’t crooked or wobbly.\n\nedit:  I think inverted boards are a great idea though we haven’t done many  (2021 mainly).  It would generally be easier to work on if the robot lays down on one side reasonably well.  Some robots are hard to work on with all the electronics in the bellypan with plenty in the way.",
