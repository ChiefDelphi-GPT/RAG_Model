                    "cooked": "Question – how do NEO motors compare to 775Pros? My team has used them in the past, but hasn’t in a couple of years, so I’ve never had any experience with them. This year my team used basically all NEOs for anything that needed more than a NEO 550 could do, but I’m going through old lessons and reading that 775Pros are good for whenever you need more than a 550. For teams that have used both 775Pros and NEOs, what are your thoughts? And when do you choose one over the other?\n\nAlso, we also switched to using MaxPlanetary gearboxes instead of VersaPlanetary because of their compatibility with NEOs. If we do start using 775Pros again, is it better to use them with VersaPlanetary, since they’re from Vex, or are MaxPlanetaries still better?",

They’re super simple mechanically,  generally cheaper to produce, and can function without any kind of motor control (apply power to the leads, and it runs!) image 778×560 33.7 KB\n\nimage 778×560 33.7 KB\n\nimage 778×560 33.7 KB\n\nNeos, Neo 550’s, Falcons are all Brushless , which have a number of advantages over brushed motors, including them being lighter, they produce less heat, and have less electrical noise. However, they require motor controllers. This isn’t a major downside in FRC, because we tend to use motor controllers anyway. image 606×636 38.9 KB\n\nimage 606×636 38.9 KB\n\nimage 606×636 38.9 KB\n\nGiven a low torque application, I would personally use Neo 550’s over 775pros. Given a higher torque application I would generally use NEOs, Falcons, or CIM/MiniCIMs.\n\nThis does, however, depend on what resources you have on hand, how much space you have for the motor in your mechanism, etc.\n\nPictures taken from: https://motors.vex.com/brushed-brushless (they’re GIFs when viewed on Vex’s page!)",

We have some RedLine stuff kicking around (and used one in our 2021 rebuild out of cheapskatery), but it’s really tough to beat the power, built-in current limiting, and ease of integrating encoders.\n\nWe’ve also used full-size NEOs in places where we might’ve normally only needed a NEO 550 (or before that, the 775Pro or RedLine) just because it packaged better.  For example, take our 2020 yeet drums to kick out game pieces into the lower port. Two NEOs on that is hilariously overpowered, but it would’ve required significantly more manufacturing (and probably a chain or belt run) to package in a planetary gearbox like we did on the conveyor belts where we had the space (note the two blue Sport gearboxes on the diagonal member).\n\n60410188822__8073F15B-6651-409D-90D3-AF5E90D1A72E 3024×4032 2.77 MB\n\n60410188822__8073F15B-6651-409D-90D3-AF5E90D1A72E 3024×4032 2.77 MB\n\n60410188822__8073F15B-6651-409D-90D3-AF5E90D1A72E 3024×4032 2.77 MB\n\nAs to your other question: 775s will run just fine in a MAX Planetary.  We converted from Sport gearboxes to the MPs this year (with the UltraPlanetary for high speed NEO 550 applications), and we’re pretty happy with the versatility and load ratings.",

                    "cooked": "To add to all the other information,\n\n775s are a small, very high power brushed motor.  They have a much higher RPM than a NEO or falcon, with around 15% less power.  As a result, for pretty much any application you are going to need to use a gearbox or other significant reduction and it’s going to have to be more than you would need for a Neo or Falcon to achieve the same speed.  In most situations the 775 is going to end up being very comparable to the neo or falcon in weight when you take the gearing into account.\n\nThe 775 is physically smaller than a Neo or Falcon and that works to its benefit, however the smaller size also comes with reduced thermal capacity.  A 775 will fail much faster than a Neo or Falcon.  In addition, the way most teams gear down the motors (planetaries) will result in the overall length of the 775, Neo, and Falcon being very compariable.\n\nIn short.\n\n775:\n\nSlightly smaller\n\nSlightly lighter\n\nSlightly less power\n\nRequires more reduction\n\nBurns out very easily in comparison\n\nRequires external encoder for closed loop control\n\nNeo/Falcon\n\nSlightly larger\n\nSlightly heavier\n\nSlightly more powerful\n\nRequires less reduction\n\nIncreased weight means additional thermal mass and durability\n\nIntegral encoder\n\nThere are vanishingly few situations where a 775 has a compelling use case.  There might be a few, but I can’t think of any where I would legitimately use one.\n\nThat said, we’ve found neo550’s to be acceptable, but their reduced thermal mass also means one mistake ends in a toasted motor.  So in that vein, there are fewer and fewer situations where I will willing spec a neo550 unless I’m forced into it because of space considerations.\n\nThis year we used 550s on our swerve steering, turret, and hood.  But only because we didn’t have the money to spring for Falcons, and Falcons were rarely available.\n\nWe actually gifted all of our brushless motors (around 40 775s and a comparable number of cims and motor controllers) to a low budget team earlier this year because we doubted we’d use them and they needed them far more than we did.\n\n550s work just fine with versas.  That’s what we used this year.",

Force can be changed by changing your lever arm (gear reduction).  So once you slow down the 775 through a gear reduction, the torque will be a lot more compariable.\n\nTotal power is measured in watts.  340 something for a 775, and 400 ish for a neo/falcon.

Both are rated for more (VEX tests them at 516 for NEO, 783 for Falcon 500), but consider that past about 500 watts you’re placing a bet on your 40A breaker’s trip times (in that 12.5 volts * 40 amps = 500 watts).  That can be made a safer bet by designing around the breaker’s rated trip times, using the better-rated REV breakers, only using new ones that haven’t been tripped, and by ensuring your electronics don’t start a match hot–but because we live in a world where Goofy Things Happen, there’s always some small amount of gamble to it.",

This is important if your motor is in a exposed position like on a intake. Also if the motor needs to mounted a distance away from the motor controller there is no encoder cable to worry about.\n\nA big disadvantage of a 775s is they depend on high RPM for cooling. They do not do well highly loaded or at stalled conditions.\n\nIn most other cases the brush-less motors are better.",

It is highly recommended to adjust the Smart Current Limit when driving the NEO 550.\n\nDo you really want all the current when it will smoke the motor in 2 seconds?  You should never stall a NEO550 (all motors hate being stalled), but if you are going to run it slow/stalled, current limits are really essential.\n\nThe motor windings can only dissipate so much heat to the air, and will not all be kept at the same temperature by even a whole lot of airflow.  It would be interesting to see how long a NEO550, with independent forced-air cooling, could survive 80A.  My guess is it would still be under a minute…",
