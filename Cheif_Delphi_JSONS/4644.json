I’ve been exploring the platform and thought I’d share some insights and comparisons to help others get started.\n\nThe 3DExperience Platform offers a comprehensive suite of tools that can potentially replace GrabCAD and provide additional benefits. Here are a few reasons why it might be a great option:\n\nIntegrated Collaboration : Unlike GrabCAD, which primarily focuses on file sharing, 3DExperience offers integrated project management and collaboration tools through 3DSpace. This allows teams to manage their projects, track progress, and collaborate more effectively.\n\nCloud Storage and Access : With 3DDrive, you get cloud storage similar to GrabCAD, but with the added advantage of seamless integration with other 3DExperience apps. This means you can access your files from anywhere and collaborate in real-time.\n\nAdvanced Design Tools : The platform includes powerful design tools like SOLIDWORKS, which are integrated into the 3DExperience ecosystem. This can streamline your workflow and enhance your design capabilities. check this:\n\n3DEXPERIENCE SOLIDWORKS Add-In\n\n3DSpace : This is your project hub where you can create and manage collaborative spaces. It’s designed for team collaboration, project management, and storing all your design data in one place.\n\n3DDrive : Think of this as your cloud storage solution. It allows you to store, share, and access your files from anywhere, similar to GrabCAD, but with better integration with other 3DExperience tools.\n\nUpgrade to the Latest Version : Make sure you’re using the latest version of SOLIDWORKS (2023-2024) to avoid compatibility issues. Uninstall any older versions, install the new one, and reboot your system.\n\nBrowser Settings : If you’re having trouble with 3DExperience in your browser, try clearing your cache and cookies or use Incognito mode. Switching to a different browser like Edge might also help.\n\nActivate the Add-In : Ensure that the 3DEXPERIENCE Add-In is properly installed and activated in SOLIDWORKS. This is crucial for seamless integration.\n\nCreate Collaborative Spaces : Set up your Collaborative Space from the browser window using the 3DSpace App. This will help you manage your projects and collaborate with your team effectively.\n\nSOLIDWORKS FRIST Sponsorship: Free SOLIDWORKS for FIRST ® Teams | SOLIDWORKS\n\nI hope this helps anyone who’s feeling a bit lost with the 3DExperience Platform. Feel free to share your experiences, tips, and any issues you’re facing. Let’s help each other make the most of this powerful tool!\n\nGood Luck!",

Teams weren’t using it for “ supplier-specific, reliable models for professional projects”, they used it to share and maintain their CAD files within private groups for members of their team. It was simple, light, and had a great UI.\n\nRespectfully, teams don’t want a public repository of supplier parts, they want a replacement for GrabCAD workbench. Just recreate that, and teams who still use Solidworks will gladly use it. The loss of GrabCAD has been the greatest win for Onshape in the educational and hobbyist community because other CAD systems do not seem to understand what the educational and hobbyist userbase is looking for. This group does not want complex and heavy industrial products, they just want GrabCAD workbench.",

I’ve been using mechanical CAD for over a decade, working with a large number of different companies and a couple different CAD programs. There are three things I use as an integral part of the CAD process: modeling (CAD), file sharing, and CAM. I don’t even know what “integrated project management and collaboration tools” means if not file sharing. Right now my team is using Fusion for CAM and SolidWorks for CAD and are happy enough with those products, but since the loss of GrabCAD workbench we have been trying various replacements with nothing really working well. Filesharing is basically the only thing I want.\n\nIf 3Dexperience can be used as a simple file sharing platform, please give us a guide to setting it up and using it for that purpose. I’ve honestly been unable to understand if 3DExperience could be used to manage files while still using desktop SolidWorks, and if so how to set it up.",

It might seem overwhelming at first because the platform offers a ton of functionality beyond file sharing, but for your specific need. you can use (( SOLIDWORKS Cloud Apps for FIRST teams)), here’s how it works:\n\nInstall and Connect:\n\nYou’ll need to install the 3DEXPERIENCE Connector for SOLIDWORKS . This bridges your desktop SOLIDWORKS with the platform.\n\nOnce installed, you can access 3DEXPERIENCE directly from the SOLIDWORKS Task Pane.\n\nOrganize Files:\n\nFiles can be stored in “Collaborative Spaces” on the platform. Think of these as cloud-based folders for your team to share and organize CAD data.\n\nYou can upload parts, assemblies, and drawings directly from SOLIDWORKS into the platform.\n\nVersion Control and Sharing:\n\nFiles stored in 3DEXPERIENCE automatically track versions. Your team will always know who has the latest version and can work collaboratively without overwriting each other’s work.\n\nYou can share files securely with external users by providing them access to specific spaces or using export/download options.\n\nOffline Mode:\n\nIf you’re working offline, you can check out files to your local machine, work on them, and sync changes back to the platform when you’re connected.\n\ncheck this video too:",

                    "cooked": "Yes, if your team is storing files in 3DEXPERIENCE and using desktop SOLIDWORKS (( 3DExperience SOLIDWORKS - SOLIDWORKS Connected)), you can open previously downloaded files without an internet connection, even if you didn’t formally “check them out,” provided they were cached locally via the SOLIDWORKS 3DEXPERIENCE add-in . Here’s how it works and what to keep in mind:\n\nLocal Cache Mechanism:\n\nWhen you open a file from 3DEXPERIENCE using the SOLIDWORKS add-in, a copy of that file is cached locally on your computer. This allows you to open it later without needing internet access.\n\nExporting and Editing Offline:\n\nAs long as the file is cached, you can: Open the file in SOLIDWORKS offline. Export it as a .3mf or other formats for 3D printing. Save a local copy, make revisions, and upload the updated version to 3DEXPERIENCE when back online.\n\nOpen the file in SOLIDWORKS offline.\n\nExport it as a .3mf or other formats for 3D printing.\n\nSave a local copy, make revisions, and upload the updated version to 3DEXPERIENCE when back online.\n\nOffline Workflow for Modifications:\n\nIf you need to revise a part offline, SOLIDWORKS will let you make changes to the cached file. Once you reconnect to the internet, you can manually upload the updated version to the platform and resolve any versioning conflicts.\n\nBefore Going Offline:\n\nOpen all the files you think you might need in SOLIDWORKS while connected to the internet. This ensures they are cached locally.\n\nOptionally, use the Reserve (Check Out) function to explicitly lock and download the files for offline use.\n\nAt the Competition:\n\nOpen cached files in SOLIDWORKS.\n\nExport them for 3D printing or save local revisions as needed.\n\nAfter Reconnecting:\n\nRe-sync your files to 3DEXPERIENCE by uploading the revised versions.\n\nFiles you haven’t opened or downloaded while online won’t be accessible offline.\n\nCollaborative features (e.g., task assignment, cloud-based versioning) require internet connectivity and won’t work offline.\n\nCached files are only available on the specific device where they were downloaded.\n\ncheck this video:",
