Whether you’re a rookie team looking for a fast start or an experienced team. ExcaLib gives solutions for simplifying your code.\n\nWhat is inside?\n\nPre-built mechanism classes - for common mechanisms like arms, elevators, turrets, and flywheels\n\nPre-built mechanism classes - for common mechanisms like arms, elevators, turrets, and flywheels\n\nComplete custom swerve drive implementation with advanced control and easy setup - will be released with v.1.0.0 .\n\nComplete custom swerve drive implementation with advanced control and easy setup - will be released with v.1.0.0 .\n\nPID , motion profiling, and feedforward utilities and controls.\n\nPID , motion profiling, and feedforward utilities and controls.\n\nGeneric hardware wrappers - for motors, motor groups, and IMUs, making your development even simpler.\n\nGeneric hardware wrappers - for motors, motor groups, and IMUs, making your development even simpler.\n\nCommand-based extensions for WPILib\n\nCommand-based extensions for WPILib\n\nBuilt-in telemetry/logging via NetworkTables .\n\nBuilt-in telemetry/logging via NetworkTables .\n\nUtilities for common robot tasks, such as alliance utilities for geometry-based functions.\n\nUtilities for common robot tasks, such as alliance utilities for geometry-based functions.\n\nBuilt by a Team, for Teams\n\nExcaLib was developed by Team 6738 Excalibur and used extensively during the 2025 Reefscape season , powering a full competition robot.\n\nWe started using it at the 2024 Israeli Off-Season and also throughout 4 events so far in the 2025 season. After seeing that ExcaLib works well, we decided to share it with the entire community.\n\nEven though this is not a beta - it’s a well-tested release, now publicly available as a pre-release version. We welcome your feedback, issues, and proposals.\n\nGet Started\n\nFull documentation: https://excalib.excaliburfrc.com\n\nGitHub repository: https://github.com/ExcaliburFRC/ExcaLib\n\nWhy ExcaLib?\n\nWe built ExcaLib because we were tired of rewriting the same logic every season - tuning controllers, wrapping hardware, wiring up logging systems. We wanted a foundation that was clean , scalable , and easy to implement , with just the right abstractions to let your team focus on innovation.\n\nIf you’re an FRC dev looking to save time, reduce bugs, and write smarter code - give ExcaLib a try.\n\nWe’d love to hear your feedback, suggestions, or feature requests.\n\nLet’s build better robot code, together.\n\n-= Team 6738, Excalibur FRC =-",

                    "cooked": "This looks really neat! I’m not done reading yet, but I’ve already got some questions/ideas:\n\nFor classes such as TalonFXMotor , it would be really helpful to know what they extend ( TalonFX class from CTRE in this case). That isn’t highlighted in the docs, and I stumbled across that fun fact in the source code. This would let me know that I can still call methods that return status signals, or interface with the motor directly. I like that design choice, but please tell us in the docs!\n\nSome notes on the documentation:\n\nUnits are sometimes unclear. For example, in your Quickstart page, you pass a method reference, firstMotor::getMotorPosition . But you never make it clear to the user that these units are in meters, except for on a separate page.\n\nI may just be misunderstanding the terminology, but the phrase position conversion factor doesn’t make much sense by itself. I see that it’s a unit conversion, but without the example, I can’t say I’ve heard that term referred to as a position conversion factor before. If the docs made it clear what this term meant, that would help greatly. I can make a guess, but that’s never as good as the docs just telling me . IMO, docs can be verbose without being scary to look at and maintaining understandability.\n\nThis is pretty nitpicky, so take my advice with a grain of salt. However, for the method AlliancePose.getMirrored() and getRotated() , it would help to make it clear that these are dependent on the DS ’s connection status (i.e. creating these at robot init will cause problems if it switches to the red alliance. I see it’ll output a warning, but from the docs themselves, I may not realize this, especially if I haven’t shot myself in the foot with that one before.\n\nIt’s obvious that your API docs aren’t the plain docs generated by javadoc (they look very nice, good work!), but when I’m browsing the API for WPILib I find myself looking at the source code often, because it’s linked to the method names in their descriptions. If that could be implemented, that would be super.\n\nBut don’t get the impression I’m not impressed. This is super interesting, and I’m interested to see where this goes!\n\nFinally, there seems to be a bug with the API docs. This may just be me, but clicking on some fields ( IdleState and DirectionState seem to be problematic) don’t load, and instead crash the site. Reloading opens a vercel error page. image 1920×1048 28.1 KB This is the site after clicking on IdleState . I reload, and get this: image 1920×1048 45.7 KB\n\nimage 1920×1048 28.1 KB\n\nimage 1920×1048 28.1 KB\n\nimage 1920×1048 45.7 KB\n\nimage 1920×1048 45.7 KB\n\nThis error page also happens whenever I reload any site on any page that isn’t the homescreen. Among other things, this means I can’t “open in new tab” anything, nor can I duplicate the tab. I have to duplicate the tab and then go to the home page and then go back to whatever I need to see, which isn’t great for quickly looking at the docs and the API at the same time. A fix would be appreciated, but it’s not a big deal.",

I’ll also add a note in the docs for extra clarity, just in case. Thanks so much for the feedback!",

But you never make it clear to the user that these units are in meters, except for on a separate page.\n\nGenerally, the term “position conversion factor” refers to the conversion between one motor rotation and the desired position unit. For example, if you have a mechanism with a gear ratio of 5:1 and you want to measure its position in radians, the position conversion factor would be 2pi/5. The mechanism rotates 1/5 of a full rotation for every motor rotation, and you multiply this by 2pi to convert from rotations to radians.",
