                    "cooked": "I really appreciate the fact that we are moving towards functional programming with commands, and having specific classes for instances where you’d want to just pass in method references for actions you want to do instead of writing fully blown classes. As well as different classes that get different types of commands like InstantCommand , RunCommand , StartEndCommand .\n\nBut lets say you want a command that runs as long as a button is pressed and do an action when its stopped you either have to make a FunctionalCommand where it can look something like this:\n\nor simply chaining and andThen() after a RunCommand . But what if you need to define an isFinished logic if you want the command to end early? Theres no predefined class where you just pass in method references for execute, isFinished, and end. You could just use the FunctionalCommand and leave the init: () -> {} to do nothing. But personally I believe it can get confusing, or cumbersome to always having to define each part of a Command when you’re not even using it.\n\nI think it would be really helpful if we have a CommandBuilder class where we can pass in the methods you want to reference, and the command builder will build a command with only those parts and not having to pass in a “do nothing” section. It can look something like this:\n\nI think this design pattern can be beneficial in some instances than using a FunctionalCommand:\n\nyou can define isFinished() with a boolean OR a BooleanSupplier while you still have to pass () -> false if you use FunctionalCommand .\n\nyou can define isFinished() with a boolean OR a BooleanSupplier while you still have to pass () -> false if you use FunctionalCommand .\n\nsame with end() you can pass in a Consumer<Boolean> or a Runnable instead of having to ignore the boolean if you just want to pass an action where it doesn’t matter if the command was interrupted or not.\n\nsame with end() you can pass in a Consumer<Boolean> or a Runnable instead of having to ignore the boolean if you just want to pass an action where it doesn’t matter if the command was interrupted or not.\n\nthis way you don’t have to define sections of the command you want to leave empty. You are forced to define every part in a FunctionalCommand . The CommandBuilder object can start off with the init & exec to do nothing, isFinished as returning true, and end to do nothing unless you change it by using the chain methods.\n\nthis way you don’t have to define sections of the command you want to leave empty.

But using a builder pattern you can pass them however you want, and easier to understand which parts you’re adding in without fancy intellisense.\n\nit is easier to read. having to pass in every part of the command through the constructor can be confusing, and you have to remember which order to put them in.
