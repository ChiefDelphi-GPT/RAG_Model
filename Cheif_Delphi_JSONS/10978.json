                    "cooked": "Hey,\n\nWe’ve had issues with our autonomous pathing behaving very differently on different carpets. Reviewing the logs from various matches, it seems that the issue lies in the odometry drifting in different ways on different carpets. Over the last events we played, we accounted for this by fudging our waypoints in pathplanner, but this takes several matches to dial in correctly and often we only have one, maybe two runs on a new carpet before we have to have a new path dialed in.\n\nIf you have encountered a similar issue, how did you solve it and/or how are you mitigating it?\n\nWe have tried:\n\nDouble-checking the kinematic class has the right measurements (using distance from center of robot to center of wheel).\n\nRetuning the PIDs on Pathplanner - we have confirmed that the robot odometry always matches the waypoints to +/- 3 cm, and the paths are precise - they just aren’t accurate.\n\nFudging our overall odometry based on distance traveled: This showed some promise, but the odometry is still not precise to field.\n\nTracking odometry for each individual swerve module: We were able to demonstrate some play between module odometries, which would imply some slip that would explain our issues. Looking into cross-referencing them to validate their positions.\n\nWe know vision is an option to combat this as well, and are investigating it. However, given the time constraints before worlds, we doubt this could be integrated successfully in 2-3 practices.\n\nIf this is something you think you know the root cause of, we would love to know.",

You can try to be fancy by identifying when your wheels are slipping and taking that out of your odemetry, which might help. What exactly if wrong with the odemetry? Is it just showing up shorter or longer than expected?",

Measure the effective wheel circumference using a tape measure when driving with and against the carpet nap and you will be surprised. You can also just mark a position on a wheel with a sharpie, and roll the robot back and forth a few times and see where the sharpie mark ends up.\n\nVision is your best bet to combat this.",

Will is right that carpet nap and tread wear have a big effect too. Before the swerve era several WCD teams found that some wheel types were worse than others when it came to path consistency.  I seem to recall a few high profile teams switching to blue nitrile over colsons (or maybe it was the other way, I don’t remember so someone please correct me).  Depending on what wheels/tread you are already running you could experiment with that too.\n\nEdit: found the post about switching to blue nitrile from 254: What are the benefits of using Colson wheels? - #5 by Jared_Russell",
