Today we’d like to share our work with you.\n\nhttps://github.com/Rabyte-association/Rabyte_Swerve_Module\n\nBasic characteristics of our module:\n\nas metric as possible\n\nusing NEOs for both driving and steering\n\nusing Redux HELIUM Canandcoders\n\ncustom polyurethane cast wheels with PLA cores\n\n30x60mm profiles for frame\n\nsome 3D printed parts\n\ngears are modified off-the-shelf metric gears\n\n7:64 steering ratio\n\n1:7 or 4:21 drive ratio (1 gear swap)\n\nthe design is based on the SDS mk4\n\nHow do you like it? Do you have any suggenstions? We’d be happy to hear your thoughts.",

One of those screws is always going to want to unscrew on you.  You can make it work with loctite.   That’s easily changed in future if you want to chance it. image 858×563 94.6 KB\n\nI’d consider making the axle bolt go all the way through a hollow axle, rather than be fastened by screws on either side.

Right now, if you want to change a wheel, you have to loosen those bolts from above, where they are obstructed by the motors.  That could be a headache. image 844×604 57.3 KB\n\nSpeaking of the way the wheel attaches. you might consider flipping the bolts that secure the fork to the steering pulley.

Hopefully you find it quick to build because the current rules really don’t favour building your own.  Other teams will be able to use their pre-assembled Mk4 modules from a previous year while you will have to remachine all of this every year .",

While not a major problem, it’s still a failure point that this design should all but do away with.",
