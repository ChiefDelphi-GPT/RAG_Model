However, unlike other driving simulators like MoSimulator , which are built on game engines, this “game” is actually a simulation of the Java robot code running on our physical off-season robot, “11:59.” This same robot competed in the 2024 Beijing WRC Off-Season Event .\n\ncgi-bin_mmwebwx-bin_webwxgetmsgimg_&MsgID=128748877247322637&skey=@crypt_e23f8ed8_b4eda57d82ee47e566b68aecc1d17c72&mmweb_appid=wx_webfilehelper 1280×2275 195 KB\n\ncgi-bin_mmwebwx-bin_webwxgetmsgimg_&MsgID=128748877247322637&skey=@crypt_e23f8ed8_b4eda57d82ee47e566b68aecc1d17c72&mmweb_appid=wx_webfilehelper 1280×2275 195 KB\n\ncgi-bin_mmwebwx-bin_webwxgetmsgimg_&MsgID=128748877247322637&skey=@crypt_e23f8ed8_b4eda57d82ee47e566b68aecc1d17c72&mmweb_appid=wx_webfilehelper 1280×2275 195 KB\n\nIn this simulator, everything that happens to your robot in real life also happens in the virtual environment:\n\nThe mechanisms are simulated using WPILib Physics Simulation .\n\nThe auto-aim feature is powered by a vision system, simulated through PhotonLib Simulation .\n\nThe chassis is modeled mathematically, calculating the motors’ propelling forces and the wheels’ gripping forces for a realistic driving experience.\n\nAdditionally, AI robots can assist in practicing various strategies, such as feed-and-shoot drills, providing a versatile training experience.\n\nIn addition to driver practice, a realistic simulation is a valuable tool for programmers. It allows you to fine-tune your code or adjust autonomous stages without needing the physical robot, making development and testing more efficient.\n\nDuring the build season, this means you can begin writing robot code as soon as the robot’s design is finalized. By the time the robot is fully built, you’ll already have a well-tested robot code in the simulator, and you might even have a conceptual autonomous stage ready to go.\n\nIron Maple's swerve-drive skeleton project, based on 6328's Advanced Swerve Drive Example - Shenzhen-Robotics-Alliance/Maple-Swerve-Skeleton\n\nIf you are not used to FRC Java programming, you might need some help from a programmer in your team\n\nOpen the latest build of Advantage-Scope , select Help -> Use Custom Assets Folder , select Maple-Swerve-Skelton/example/5516-2024-OffSeason/AdvantageScopeAssets\n\nIn WPILib Vscode , run Simulate Java according to this guide\n\nIn Advantage Scope: Drag AdvantageKit/RealOutputs/Field/Robot to 2D Poses , make it Robot Drag AdvantageKit/RealOutputs/Field/Note to 3D Poses , make it Note Drag AdvantageKit/RealOutputs/Shooter/MechanismPose to 3D Poses , make it Component (Robot) Drag AdvantageKit/RealOutputs/Field/RobotBlue to 3D Poses , make it Blue Ghost (these are blue AI robots) Drag AdvantageKit/RealOutputs/Field/RobotRed to 3D Poses , make it Red Ghost (these are red AI-robots)\n\nDrag AdvantageKit/RealOutputs/Field/Robot to 2D Poses , make it Robot\n\nDrag AdvantageKit/RealOutputs/Field/Note to 3D Poses , make it Note\n\nDrag AdvantageKit/RealOutputs/Shooter/MechanismPose to 3D Poses , make it Component (Robot)\n\nDrag AdvantageKit/RealOutputs/Field/RobotBlue to 3D Poses , make it Blue Ghost (these are blue AI robots)\n\nDrag AdvantageKit/RealOutputs/Field/RobotRed to 3D Poses , make it Red Ghost (these are red AI-robots)\n\nDouble-Right-Click the 3D field, Select DriverStation -> and choose a driver-station view\n\nAttach an Xbox Game Controller to Simulation GUI\n\nin the Simulation GUI, select Teleoperated to begin Teleop simulation\n\nYou can also select autonomous mode in SmartDashboard/SelectAuto in your dashboard, select Autonomous in the simulation GUI.  If you want the robot to also shoot preload, grab a note in Teleoperated mode, select Disable mode and then select Autonomous mode.\n\nThis project is generated using Maple Swerve Skeleton . If you use this skeleton to create your own robot code, the simulator will perfectly match your real robot. Key elements like mass, gearing, motors, and program logic will all be identical, making it ideal for driver practice early in the build season.\n\nGitHub - Shenzhen-Robotics-Alliance/Maple-Swerve-Skeleton: Iron Maple's swerve-drive skeleton project, based...
