I think it needs to be sent once not every time the program loops if (joyStick_1.getRightY() > 0.2 || joyStick_1.getRightY() < -0.2){ wrist_motor.set(-1 0.6 joyStick_1.getRightY()); //wrist_motor_encoder = wrist_motor.getEncoder(); w_position = wrist_motor_encoder.getPosition();\n\n}\n\nelse { //wrist_motor_encoder = wrist_motor.getEncoder(); wrist_motor_pidController.setReference(w_position, CANSparkMax.ControlType.kPosition);\n\n}",

                    "cooked": "Regarding functionality, have a look at the smart motion control that comes with it. It allows you to use motion profiling to get a smoother and better control. We used smart motion on our robot this year for both the scoring arm and the cube intake and it works super well.\n\nStill talking about things that will impact your robot’s performance, in most cases it is good practice to avoid analog controls from the drivers (except for the drivetrain). Having to manually adjust your robot’s wrist during the match so it goes to the correct position for scoring is normally slower and leads to higher chances of getting it wrong and missing the point you were going for. What I would suggest is mapping the wrist position for each of the situations you have and using a state machine controlled by button presses so you can use a single click to get your wrist to exactly where it has to be.\n\nRegarding the Java code itself, you can have a look into clean code and SOLID concepts. It is good practice to structure your code in a way to avoid repetition and that makes the code explain itself. This way things are going to be easier to understand/maintain when you find any issues with your logic or decide to add different functionalities. Some suggestions are:\n\nYou can extract the condition of the if to a boolean method/function called “isJoystickOutsideOfDeadband” so it is clearer what you are checking\n\nHave your deadband be a constant that is the same for all places where you apply it to this same joystick. This way if you change it you never risk forgetting some place and causing issues\n\nExtract this logic to a function/method with some name like “controlWristWithJoystick”, so whenever you look at it you know what is expected",

                    "cooked": "I am not very familiar with using Java for FRC applications, in our team we use labview, so excuse me if I am misunderstanding any of the functions you are using.\n\nReading your code it seems that you want to move the robot’s wrist to the position of the joystick whenever it is outside of the deadband and whenever you let go, it should stay in position. Without seeing it in action I would expect there to be a problem with a bit of rebound whenever the driver thinks the position is right. This should happen because if the joystick value does not instantly go back to zero when they let go, the setpoint for the wrist will be changed to a lower value before that case stops being executed. There might also be an error related to setting what you PID considers the zero but not setting the pid to target the zero position, so when you let go it will be at an offset from what it thought was the position. My guess is that the current setup would be a bit hard to control so the wrist lands in the position you want.\n\nI would avoid changing your wrist’s zero (if that is what wrist_motor_pidController.setReference does) during operation. What we do is set a zero at startup, ensure the mechanism always starts at the same position and then define the positions we want for grabbing objects/scoring at each position. This way instead of manually controlling it, you can change it to a button that sends the wrist to that exact position when you click it. That takes a huge load away from the drivers and lets them focus on being more effective on the field.\n\nOne example that we are implementing for champs is using our limelight for detecting where we are relative to the scoring positions and, if the robot is confident enough that it is in a position it will score, the robot itself will send the command to lower the arm and place the object. This way our drivers still have control, but if they are unsure about their positioning, the robot can decide for them and make things quicker.",

We never thought to switch to position control after the motion because the velocity never was right and that was one of the most important things to control during motion. We coded our own control that works right but it was more effort than using canned software.",

                    "cooked": "In our experience smart motion has worked very well. My best guess would be that the systems we are using it on are over-specced. It was the goal and we find that having much more torque than the minimum necessary makes it much easier to have a tight and responsive control. The cube intake has a NEO controlling a very light mechanism (probably 1kg), which is much more than is needed. The scoring arm is a bit heavier and has much more inertia as it is much longer. This one also has more power than it needs with one NEO as we had to limit speed/acceleration on the movement to avoid unsettling the robot too much when moving the arm.\n\nFor both systems we found that the smart motion helped create a smoother motion and avoid overshooting our target (yes, overshoots can be dialed out with a well tuned PID, but it is still nice). Your point is interesting and we will have a look. Right now we are unable to run our bot’s arms, but when we are able I will try to get some plots of setpoint and position to see if we have any steady state error. If we do it is probably minimal, but still nice to investigate.",
