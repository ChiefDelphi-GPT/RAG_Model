When I try to put the chain, which is a # 25 h chain from vex, on, the first 4 or so pins of the chain go nicely onto the sprocket, and then it appears as through the pitch of the sprocket is greater than the pitch of the chain so the two stop mating . The sprockets were cut with a conservative federate and 1/8” endmill. Any idea what could be causing this?",

The dimensions and other technical specifications of Products may vary from those shown in the CAD Models, due among other reasons to tolerances associated with manufacturing processes. Manufacturing tolerance information is considered proprietary by many of our suppliers and is not always provided to us. Thus tolerance information may not be reflected in the CAD Models.\n\nThat would be a section of McMaster’s Terms and Conditions, emphasis mine.\n\nTranslation: Their CAD will be close but may not be 100% accurate. There may be a specific reason for this (see elsewhere in said T&C, that’s your homework assignment).\n\nNow, there IS a fairly simple way to see how out of whack it is. Grab a known good 40T sprocket and a known good 19T sprocket, grab a scribe (Sharpie probably won’t be good enough here, and you’ll have a hard time getting calipers in if I’m right in this), put 'em face to face with the CNC’d parts and line up their teeth. Scribe the known good onto the CNC’d part. Now grab the calipers and see how much more you gotta take off. Modify the CAD accordingly.\n\nIncidentally, I may or may not have experience with this… modified some COTS CAD for reasons , didn’t modify the teeth of the belt pulley I was working with, 3D printed the part. Belt didn’t fit right, though it wasn’t this bad. After I went back and added our standard print allowance (in our case, 1 nozzle-width less material) and reprinted, the new parts were just fine and dandy.",

At first we thought the sprocket just had the wrong geometry (likely a wrong pitch as you suggested). So naturally I cut a new one at work (geometry generated by Solidworks). Much to my dismay, the same thing happened. Next step was comparing my CAD model with the WCP model. Identical when layed over top. The concensus that I beileve we came to, was that a combination of material being to thick (cut from 0.125 material, VEX shows their normal # 25 sprockets to be 0.110) and not having chamfers on the teeth were causing our problems.\n\nThe official suggestion from WCP was to let them “wear in”. Unfortunately though, Covid happened and we never were able to confirm that the thickness and chamfers were indeed the causes of our issues.",

(use the same link)\n\nBe aware that the max roller diameter is based on linear interpolation between .250 and .375 pitch from this chart. I figure in this case most people will only be using either .250 or .375 pitch chain, so it doesn’t really matter in the end.\n\nTo use, just change the desired pitch and number of teeth and you should get the mathematically correct sprocket. It’s just an extrusion – no chamfers are modeled in. The extrusion thickness can be changed as well.\n\nI’ve tested this from tooth counts between 30 and 200. It doesn’t break! but the generation time increases with increasing tooth count.\n\nThe way I used this file was to make a copy of the part studio and reference it in the robot onshape assembly. This way, you offload the calculation into a separate file, saving you some time.\n\nLet me know if you run into issues.",
