We have tons of upcoming changes in the pipeline that we think you’ll love. We’re seeking feedback from students, leads, and mentors about their experiences using FRCDesign.org for their team’s training or personal development. We’re interested in hearing from you about whether it improved your team’s quality of life, its season performance, how you approached using the course and website, what you struggled with, and what features you would like to see added. If you have extra time for a deeper interview—either via text or voice call—we’d appreciate it. Your insights will help us improve the site for everyone.",

It effectively ensured everyone knew how to perform tasks and was planned to continue using it in the future for training new members. This significantly enhanced our team’s quality of life since we didn’t need to create our own curriculum. Additionally, it likely improved our season performance due to establishing good cad practices, which was a positive outcome. Our approach involved instructing rookies to utilize the course during the preseason and seeking assistance when needed. The website proved to be highly effective and is highly recommended for any FIRST robotics competition team considering onshape.",

FRCDesign.org proved to be our primary method for off-season CAD training, enabling us to design a highly successful and robust robot.  \n\nWhile effective for those already familiar with basic CAD skills in SOLIDWORKS, we found FRCDesign.org less helpful for students new to FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) and CADing when relying solely on online tutorials. We believe that supplementing such tools with traditional mentorship could enhance the learning experience.  \n\n Personally, I completed the first two stages of the training but found the tutorials increasingly tedious and time-consuming after that. However, I frequently returned to them for guidance on gears, belts, and chains during our robot design process. I also agree that additional tutorials on creating lightning patterns would be beneficial, as I personally struggled with this concept.  \n\nIn conclusion, FRCDesign.org has been an invaluable resource, and we look forward to using it again in the fall.",

A+ performance without notes, our best season ever, largely attributed to FRCDesign. It required only two of us, self-taught through the learning course, to make a significant impact on the team’s competitiveness. Many don’t realize how remarkable this resource truly is, and we’re fortunate to have it. Thank you, David et. al., for this outstanding project.",

Kids learned shapes in their engineering classes, and it was used on our FTC team, so they were already somewhat familiar with the platform.\n\nThe timing of the release of FRCDesign was excellent for us, and kids really dove into it. It allowed kids to get into FIRST things before we had many robot parts, and made robotics much less intimidating. Their CAD skills for rookies were PHENOMENAL, and I truly appreciate this curriculum.\n\nIt will be an integral part of our training and onboarding for all engineering students moving forward! You all are amazing, thank you for the work you put into this.\n\nNext step is FRCprogramming.org, followed by FRCFundraising.org, FRCBranding.org, and FRCImpact.org, right?",

Despite some challenges such as issues at Stage 1a and Stage 2, the course has proven solid, offering necessary resources for a smooth transition. With ongoing support from the FRCDesign team, we remain optimistic about further refining the website into an even better resource. Excitedly, I look forward to teaching our new members Onshape this upcoming week.",

Returning designers continued with Stage 2 this summer, while new students completed Stage 1. This course established a forward-thinking training pipeline. Feedback indicated that the course improved team quality of life, season performance, and provided foundational CAD skills. Students appreciated the structured approach, ease of use, and practical applications. Challenges included vague instructions and insufficient detail in later stages. Suggestions for improvement included voiceovers, video walkthroughs, and common pitfalls. Overall, FRCDesign.org significantly enhanced team preparation, leading to strong performance in the 2025 season.",

This has meant I’ve been closely observing and learning about the project from its early stages. Consequently, I haven’t jumped into using it immediately.  \n\nAs a student, I taught myself CAD with great difficulty due to the complexity involved.  \n\nI’m impressed with how the site has evolved over time. Much of my feedback comes from noticing trends in how students interact with the learning course.  \n\nI would appreciate more detailed information comparing OnShape Team usage to regular site usage. Some students tend to place every item they create in the team workspace, regardless of relevance.  \n\nThere are common misconceptions about how the site should be used as a tool. While some students are self-motivated and independent, others benefit from more direct guidance. For these students, seeking help isn’t always straightforward. The course’s goals are outlined in the Educator’s Guide, but students may not consult it independently. I plan to include reminders for asking questions and involving mentors or older students as part of Stage 0.  \n\nLearning how to create and interpret drawings is a valuable skill, especially concerning manufacturing resources and general lifelong skills.  \n\nSome common mistakes new students make include misclicking on dimensions or misplacing them, as well as misclicking on assembly mates, confusing points, edges, or faces.  \n\nWe aim to structure our use of the site more effectively during the summer and fall, hoping to increase interest among CAD students.",
