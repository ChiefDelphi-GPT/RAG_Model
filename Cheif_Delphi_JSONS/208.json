It has been a great way to make sure everyone knows how to do stuff, and we plan on using it in the future to teach new members. Definitely improved our team’s quality of life(we didn’t have to make our own curriculum), very likely improved our season performance(can’t say for sure though but we finally had good CAD practices so that was nice). In terms of approach, we basically just told our rookies to work on the course in the preseason, and ask us if they needed help. Great website and I would definitely recommend it to any FRC team who used Onshape.",

Going back to my point if there were more theory’s and practices of pocketing and other weight savings methods that would be beneficial in my mind Edit: also dead axel rollers could be a good idea",

FRCDesign.org was our primary method for offseason CAD training and it allowed us to design a highly successful and robust robot.\n\nWe found that it was most effective for those of us who were already familiar with basic CAD skills in SOLIDWORKS but lacked knowledge of OnShape and more advanced design concepts. It was a lot harder to engage students who were new to FRC and CADing with just the online tutorials and I think that in these situations, FRCDesign.org is a lot more helpful as a tool supplemented by traditional instruction from students and mentors.\n\nPersonally, I worked through the first two stages and then found the tutorials to get very tedious and time-consuming. But, I did find myself constantly referring back to the tutorials for gears, belts, and chains as we designed our robot. I agree that it would be helpful to have a tutorial on creating lightning patterns, as that was a concept that I struggled with.\n\nOverall, it was an amazing, in depth resource that we are definitely looking forward to using again in the fall!",

It was our best season by far, and a very large portion of that was because of FRCDesign. All it took was just me and a fellow teammate self-teaching using the learning course to make an outstanding impact on the teams competitiveness. I don’t think most people really appreciate how special this resource really is, and how lucky we are to have it. Thank you David et. al. for your efforts to bring about this awesome project.",

It allowed kids to get into FIRST things before we had many robot parts, and made robotics much less intimidating. Their CAD skills for rookies was PHENOMENAL and I truly thank this curriculum for it.\n\nIt will be an integral part of our training and onboarding for all engineering students moving forward! You all are amazing, thank you for the work you put into this.\n\nNext step is FRCprogramming.org , followed by FRCFundraising.org , FRCBranding.org , and FRCImpact.org , right?",

The community resources like FRCDesign and the accessibility of Onshape has allowed more students get into CAD.\n\nOverall FRCDesign’s learning course has been solid and has provided us the necessary resources to make the transition to Onshape smooth. FRCDesign has some rough spots (1a & Stage 2), but I’m hopeful that with the support of the FRCDesign team the Website will continued to be refined into an even better resource.\n\nI’m excited to teach our new members Onshape with FRCDesign this coming week.",

We’ll continue to use the learning course with our returning designers working through Stage 2 this summer, and again having our our new design team students completing Stage 1. This will likely be our “standard” training pipeline going forward.\n\nI compiled the feedback from our students and mentors for the 5 questions:\n\nhowlongismyname:\n\nDid it improve your team’s quality of life?\n\nYes, absolutely. We used the Stage 1 course to build proficiency in basic CAD and modeling skills in Onshape, and the design workflow. In the first year we had all CAD students complete this section of the learning course, regardless of previous experience.\n\nhowlongismyname:\n\nDid it improve your team’s season performance?\n\nI believe so. We were able to beat our baseline schedule CAD deadlines even though we had less design mentor time available than in prior seasons and I think the FRCDesign.org training in the fall was a significant contributor to achieving that.\n\nhowlongismyname:\n\nHow did you approach using the course and website?\n\n2910 design students were mostly returning team members, but several were new to the design team. We skipped Stage 0 because everyone was set up already in Onshape Enterprise and had a basic understanding of what CAD was from previous training. We mostly just used the learning course and a little bit of time on the mechanism examples, IIRC.\n\nSummarized from student feedback:\n\nFollowed the Stage 1 tutorials straight through step by step. UI was easy to use.\n\nUsed gain a basic understanding of CAD/get used to working in Onshape\n\nFamiliarization with Onshape tools and practices\n\nFamiliarization with common mechanisms used in FRC robots that we might use a variation of in-season\n\nLearn to CAD basic mechanisms\n\nhowlongismyname:\n\nWhat did you feel like you struggled with?\n\nSummarized from student feedback:\n\nSome of the steps to the mechanisms were pretty ambiguous and vague\n\nAt times more direct instructions would have been useful but we were able to compensate with assistance from the more experienced CAD students\n\nEspecially in the later lessons (in Stage 1) there was a lack of specificity on dimensions, materials, etc. that made it take longer than it needed to.\n\nhowlongismyname:\n\nWhat is missing that you would like the website to have?\n\nSummarized from student feedback:\n\nA voiceover to some of the instructional videos would be helpful. At times the screen recordings were hard to follow with the small cursor and buttons\n\nComplete video walkthroughs of the early lessons/tutorials, while still getting familiar with where things are in the Onshape interface\n\nA section on common CAD mistakes/pitfalls could be useful\n\nOverall, this was a fantastic resources for us. Basically all of our design mentors are extremely busy with family and/or work obligations, so finding time to do proper CAD training has been very difficult. The FRCDesign.org learning course filled that gap and allowed the mentors to focus our limited time on teaching broader design concepts while the students worked through the course during the fall. Consequently, I also don’t have much to say directly about the courses since the kids just went and did all of it on their own - but that alone was great.\n\nOur design team went into the 2025 season the most prepared we’ve been on 2910 (at least post-COVID), due in no small part to FRCDesign.org , and it showed.",

That means I’ve been seeing and hearing about it ever since it was a very new project. As a result, I didn’t end up jumping in to use it right away.\n\nAs a student, I learned CAD by teaching myself (i.e. slowly and with great difficulty).\n\nI have to say I’m impressed with how the site has developed over time. Most of my feedback comes from things I’ve noticed in students that have started going through the learning course.\n\nI would love some more detail on what an OnShape Team is compared to normal usage. Some students have a habit of putting every single thing they make in OnShape into the team workspace regardless of whether or not it has to do with the team.\n\nThere are misconceptions that go around about how the site should be used as a tool. Some kids are very good at being self-motivated and self-paced, but others need more direct guidance. For the latter group, they tend not to be forthcoming when they get stuck or need help. The intent for the course is discussed in the Educator’s Guide, but I wouldn’t expect students to look there. I’d like, as part of Stage 0, a reminder to ask questions and follow up with mentors or older students.\n\nI will die on the hill that learning how to create/read drawings is a good skill to know depending on manufacturing resources and just for life in general.\n\nSome common pitfalls I see new students make that might be good to address:\n\nMisclicking on dimensions, either overthinking where to place a dimension or accidentally clicking on another sketch feature\n\nMisclicking on assembly mates, not knowing the difference between a point, edge, or face and mating things together incorrectly\n\nFor the Summer and Fall, we are aiming to make more structured use of the site and hopefully get more CAD kids interested.",
