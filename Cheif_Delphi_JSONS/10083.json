                    "cooked": "Hello!\n\nSo we have had two instances of Spark Maxes killing USB ports on our team now and I was wondering if there were any other cases with this. Today I was plugged into a Spark Max with the included USB-C to USB-A cable and no 12v power to the motor controller. My computer was charging over USB-C if that helps at all. The controller possibly had a gate fault so I was trying to reflash the firmware on it, however, the firmware flash failed about three times before I unplugged the cable and plugged it back in. When I plugged it back in there was no longer any data being sent and the Spark Max would not turn on. I tried plugging in my mouse to the same port and had no response from it.\n\nThe second case of this happening was about 9 months ago. Someone had plugged into a Spark Max while charging on USB-C, however this time the motor controller was turned on with 12v power and connected to the CAN Bus, which is what we were trying to test. The second he plugged into the controller, his computer gave an overcurrent protection warning and the Spark Max immediately died. This instance seemed to kill all USB ports on his right side and messed up the ones on the left side which would now kill any device that had its own power source that was plugged in. His computer ended up killing 2 ESCs on his drone from the left side that was plugged into his drone battery, however, they were heavily limited on current and could not have pulled enough to die from their own battery.\n\nWe are not sure why this has happened now that this is not a one-off. We have had other computers have USB ports die but no direct evidence that they were caused by Spark Maxes.\n\nIf anyone has any ideas or suggestions I would be happy to hear them.\n\nThank you!",

My personal experience with rev hardware client has been not great though and I have seen it before where flashing a spark max over the can network has corrupted every single Spark Max on the can bus and we had to put each one in recovery mode and re-flash individually anyways. What I had been telling the team to do with Spark Maxes was turn the robot off, and connect individually and configure there. That has provided the best results for configuring the Maxes but I don’t know what to do anymore now that this is a potential risk to be concerned about.",
