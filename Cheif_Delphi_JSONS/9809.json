I think the main thing is learning how teams block out aluminum rain or dust from the many Rio ports (we tape over them), seeing how people mount them (swapped between flat and vertical in my time which were determined based on just where it would fit), and if anyone is doing enclosures for them. Also any recommended optimizations and space savings things people do (I’ve seen teams stack things on top of Rios and things like that).",

                    "cooked": "The Rio is one of the more resilient electronics in FRC for sure, and for that reason I don’t usually see top teams designing protective cases or worrying too much about ESD. Mounting it effectively is definitely very dependent on robot architecture so I wouldn’t say it’s necessarily bad that it’s moved around for your team. The roughly constant things I would consider are:\n\nKeep it visible, but not too physically exposed. You’ll want to be able to see the status lights on the Rio and see all the wires for debugging. Ideally it should be visible without removing anything that needs tools. That being said, keep it either low down in the robot (as citrus and 254 did this year) or otherwise shrouded with Velcro/other easily removable panels to make sure nothing can physically hit it under match circumstances.\n\nMount it solidly. Zip ties are pretty solid, but some VHB on the underside can’t hurt. Might not be necessary, but it can be a good idea, especially if using a rio-mounted IMU like a NavX.\n\nConnectors. Definitely cover the unused headers with electrical tape. I also personally hot glue all the non-locking connectors that I’m using. Just a dot of glue can be enough to prevent cables falling out, which is a really crappy way to lose a match.\n\nQuality of life. Add access holes for the Ethernet port and USB port if you have a shroud, even if it’s just Velcro’d. No harm in it and it makes the life of whoever has to push code at a tournament a whole lot easier.\n\nOverall it’s probably gonna end up being a bit different each year. My priority for stuff like this is just to 1. Make it not fail in the first place and 2. Make it a 5 minute fix if it does. Beyond that is up to the designer.",

If you have a navx or any one of those gyros that mount onto the Rio itself, I would strongly suggest using double-sided VHB tape and mounting it preferably on your belly pan or some other rigid material. There is really no reason for using Velcrom or other methods that allow the Rio to be taken out easily. If you need to take it out to plug in an ethernet cable you should suggest using a male-to-female cable.\n\nimage 640×640 19.2 KB\n\nimage 640×640 19.2 KB\n\nimage 640×640 19.2 KB",

I agree that some VHB underneath would probably fix this, though it would also make it a bear to replace the RIO.\n\nLast year, we tried the screw holes instead of zipties, and the threaded inserts ripped out of the RIO.  Oops, back to zipties.\n\nThis year, we had very close quarters around the RIO, which made it difficult to replace the zipties…or the RIO when it stopped booting right before elims at our second event.\n\nThe mid-season solution was to 3D print a “collar” to retain the RIO laterally and a bridge to clamp it down to the bellypan.  The collar is attached to the bellypan with screws, and the bridge is attached to the collar with screws. The bridge also served as a mounting location for the radio and CANivore.  The entire assembly got dubbed “the everything mount” .\n\nScreenshot 2023-11-29 004050 1080×659 79.5 KB\n\nScreenshot 2023-11-29 004050 1080×659 79.5 KB\n\nScreenshot 2023-11-29 004050 1080×659 79.5 KB\n\nEven with all of the ports taped this year, enough aluminum dust (raining down from the elevator) managed to sneak into the RIO and cause problems.

This provides a very solid physical mount, clamps the Swyft so it can’t work loose, and it’s still easy to swap the Rio if needed by taking off the caps on the corner blocks.\n\nElectrical tape over all unused ports is definitely a must.",
