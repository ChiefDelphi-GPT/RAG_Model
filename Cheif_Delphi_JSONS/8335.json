                    "cooked": "We used a newly purchased REV pneumatic hub in our bot this year.  We found that the compressor was failing to run when the bot was enabled.  This was an intermittent issue that would come and go.  We finally isolated it to the connection of the pressure switch.  When you pulled on the wires, the compressor would run.  Letting go made the compressor stop.   We swapped out the board for one scavenged from last year’s bot.  I took it home, did some examination, and found that there was a cold solder joint between the connector and the ground connection.  It took a ton of heat to get the joint to be good.  I hypothesize that the ground connection is to a ground plane that acts as a heat sink to that joint.  Not too much of a problem if the boards are batch soldered in an oven, but kind of tricky to resolder that joint by hand.  Is anyone else experiencing similar issues with cold solders on these boards?  If so, here’s how to fix it.\n\nNote that repairs of this kind are permitted by rule R710M.  \"Devices may be repaired, provided the performance and specifications of the device after the repair are identical to those before the repair. \"",

We have a couple of them and because they made the connectors so close together you have to use an uninsolated ferrule to install the wiring. They were supposed to be redesigning them but to my knowledge they haven’t. It made the call to not use pneumatics on our robot this year that much easier. Maybe its just one more thing rev has decided to not change like the 1\" wall thickness on the 2x1s",
