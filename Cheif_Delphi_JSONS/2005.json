                    "cooked": "Hello everyone! I’ve posted on CD yesterday and sadly got no response, which made me want to switch to Java (many people already tried to convince us to switch, although this was the breaking point). I still have to convince my team (we just have 2 programmers excluding me, and both of them know, and prefer, C++ quite a bit more than Java), but the current code doesn’t work anyways. I feel like writing actually working code in Java would convince them quite easily though.\n\nWe are using Swerve drive with Kraken X60’s and a Pigeon 2.0. I’ve already generated the project with Tuner X for Java (with a couple of hiccups here and there :)), and after going through RobotContainer.java it seems like it should be able to drive in teleop. I don’t fully understand FRC programming, but AFAIK there’s command-based and timed programming. It seems like our swerve drive system uses command-based programming (I’m not sure if it can work under time-based, correct me if I’m wrong) After reading PhotonVision examples, it looks like they use timed programming. I just want to implement aiming at the AprilTag, for now.\n\nSo, here’s a couple questions:\n\nWhich documents and/or guides should I go through? There seem to be so many to choose from, but they often use a tank-drive system or something completely different. Is there a definitive guide for our use case? (Even a comprehensive Java basics would be useful)\n\nApart from standalone guides, are there any teams’ repos which have some nicely written and easy to understand code?\n\nShould I skip the first, most basic example and immediately jump to the more advanced ones (for example Using WPILib Pose Estimation, Simulation, and PhotonVision Together )\n\nIs there anything else I should know when switching from C++ to Java? Are there any parts I could just copy-paste?",

A quick search turned up 8516’s code , but I’m sure there’s others as your setup is common enough.\n\nI wouldn’t use that as your starting point for code, but using it to bring up the basic swerve functions and prove to yourself that you can make this work at all might give the team confidence to make the switch.\n\nAs a long-time C++ programmer, the only Java code I’ve written has been for FRC and using Java is still the right call for us due to its overwhelming market share in FRC .\n\nFor guides, I’d look at Zero to Robot on WPI and maybe also check out the now a few years old zero-to-autonomous on YouTube .\n\nDespite my advice to try out some other team’s code as a proof of life, I would advise against skipping the most basic examples and jumping straight into advanced topics.

That is, for example, the statements to start and stop a device or acquire a signal are the same. The command-based gives us a very easy way to combine multiple, simultaneous actions of various devices. It manages for the most part the states and timings or conditions of when actions are supposed to happen.\n\nGet which PV example you want to use to work as is. You can move to using the command-based to perform those actions at the appropriate time.\n\nAnd I always endorse and practice what @sokoloff mentioned - get the trivial basics of a line of code to work and build up one working line of code at a time. Okay, maybe 2 or 3 trivial lines at a time as appropriate but keep the learning steps as small as possible. Small experiments are your friends whether or not the experiments work.",
