                    "cooked": "I am very happy to introduce the KITCHEN SINK, a replacement for the outgoing Swyft RoboRIO JST adapter , and also a culmination of every good (and possibly bad) idea I’ve ever had for a RoboRIO expansion board.\n\nBackground:\n\nThe moment I laid eyes on the RoboRIO for the first time in 2015, I had lots of ideas. The MXP port opened up all sorts of opportunities that the cRio would have made horribly inconvenient.\n\nI remember my very first thought being “man, it’d be cool if you could plug an Arduino in there.” My second thought was “man, I wish I could plug LEDs in there.”\n\nThere were also some things I didn’t like about the RoboRIO. Those 0.1\" header pins are great for hobby projects, but they just don’t hold very firmly inside an FRC robot. Also, the RoboRIO lacks ports for a variety of COTS sensors that see common use, like beam break sensors.\n\nAnother thing that has always bothered me with FRC electrical parts, RoboRIO included, is the lack of thought that goes into cable management. The RoboRIO has mounting screw holes, so it gets one part of the equation right. But, for all the cables coming out of it, you’d think they’d give you something to tie those down with.\n\nIntroducing the Kitchen Sink:\n\nSo, with all of that in mind, I designed a couple of RoboRIO expansion boards where I try to manifest all of these ideas.\n\nHere’s the first one, the true Kitchen Sink:\n\nKitchen Sink board render. 1723×914 128 KB\n\nKitchen Sink board render. 1723×914 128 KB\n\nKitchen Sink board render. 1723×914 128 KB\n\nThis board features absolutely everything I could cram on top of a RoboRIO. Naturally, it has all 32 “standard” RoboRIO IO ports. That’s all 10 DIOs, all 10 PWMs, all 4 analog inputs, all 4 relay outputs, I2C, SPI, RS-232, and RSL . In addition, it has…\n\n5 additional PWM /DIO ports from the MXP port.\n\n3 additional analog inputs from the MXP port.\n\n1 analog output from the MXP port.\n\n1 additional SPI port from MXP.\n\n1 TTL UART port from MXP.\n\n2 additional I2C ports from MXP.\n\n2 ports specially designed to connect to LIDAR Lite V3 sensors in PWM mode.\n\n2 ports specially designed to connect to COTS open-collector beam break sensors, like OBP903.\n\n1 indicator LED wired into a DIO on the MXP port.\n\nMVDD SEL header, which allows you to change the supply voltage supplied on MXP DIO/AIN ports between 3.3 and 5V.\n\n7 convenient cable tie points.\n\nMount point for an Arduino Nano Every, which then adds the following features: SPI connection (enabled via Rio CS1) between the Rio’s SPI port and the Arduino. 3 PWM -capable arduino DIOs. 4 Arduino analog inputs which can also be used as DIOs. 2 more PWM -capable arduino DIOs wired into Wago 250 connectors, capable of delivering adequate current to drive LED strips. Another indicator LED.\n\nSPI connection (enabled via Rio CS1) between the Rio’s SPI port and the Arduino.\n\n3 PWM -capable arduino DIOs.\n\n4 Arduino analog inputs which can also be used as DIOs.\n\n2 more PWM -capable arduino DIOs wired into Wago 250 connectors, capable of delivering adequate current to drive LED strips.\n\nAnother indicator LED.\n\nIntroducing the Little Sink:\n\nSo, some might argue that the Kitchen Sink might be slightly overkill. So, I whipped up another board called “Little Sink:”\n\nLittle Sink board render. 1723×914 114 KB\n\nLittle Sink board render. 1723×914 114 KB\n\nLittle Sink board render. 1723×914 114 KB\n\nLittle Sink drops the Arduino and COTS sensor-specific stuff. Instead, it’s basically just one of those Swyft JST boards except it also breaks out the entire MXP port.\n\nI’m hoping to get some feedback about this concept in general.\n\nWhat do/don’t you like about each design?\n\nIs this something your team would want?\n\nWhat would you want on your own personal “Kitchen Sink” board?\n\nPlease note that this is something I’m doing as a side project, and it’s not directly associated with 1732.",

The Euroblock screw terminals are convenient for both initial assembly and field replacement and have been solidly reliable for us.\n\nOur design is freely available on our Wiki page, or you can send a PM requesting the design files.",
