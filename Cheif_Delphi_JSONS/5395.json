                    "cooked": "If you/your team used PhotonVision in the 2023/2024 season, we would love to hear your feedback below! Like other feedback threads , I like structuring feedback as looking for the good, the bad, and the ugly:\n\nThe good : What worked well? What did you find particularly beneficial to your team? What would you like to see more of?\n\nThe bad : What didn’t work? What did you struggle with? What would you like to see changed?\n\nThe ugly : What did you have to hack around to make it work for you? What made figuring out the right solution more difficult for you (e.g. wasted precious time)?\n\nWe’ll be using this feedback to evaluate priorities during the upcoming offseason. Any feedback is valuable – if we don’t know about, it we can’t fix it! I’ll again note that as PhotonVision is an open-source community project run by students, alumni, and working professionals in their free time, the best way to see a feature get implemented is to implement it yourself, or get someone in the community interested in implementing it. We welcome both ideas and contributors!\n\nThe most permanent way to make sure a particular issue doesn’t get lost in the noise is to open a GithHub issue ticket – we’ll be triaging these as we move into the offseason.",

                    "cooked": "First off, thank you all on the PV team for working on this project. This is our second year using photonvision. Our experience is overall positive, so even though there may be a some things listed under ‘bad’ and ‘ugly’, our hope is to help improve the project, not to try and bring anyone down, or call out any critical flaw.\n\nHardware\n\nIntel N100 Mini PC running Clear Linux 1x OV2311 USB from Arducam AprilTag decoder at full res (1600x1200)\n\nThe Good\n\nIt worked! This year, we relied heavily on localization for teleop and autonomous, for both pathing corrections, aiming for shooting to the speaker from distance, and aiming for shuttling game pieces.\n\nEven with the variations from the field, we had good results throughout the season. By champs, we were trusting tags up to 6m away (with 2 or more tags). We eventually fixed our auton launcher accuracy issues by champs, but these were not caused by vision. Pathing corrections worked great, and we were able to pick up game pieces, even with a slightly narrow intake, and even after taking some large hits at the center line. Our teleop accuracy was great through all of our events.\n\nThe fallback option for single tag of ‘closet to previous pose’ performed better than ‘closest to gryo’ in our testing. No issues here.\n\nBy the end of the season, mrcal results were very good for the lens that came with the Arducam. The calibration tool showing when corners are detected, and where they are detected is great. It can be a bit hard to figure out lighting and why its not showing, but getting the feedback of when corners are detected, makes this process very smooth.\n\nBeing able to pull the images and run the mrcal command line tools, while not exactly easy or approachable here, was a nice fallback option to verify results. We stopped using this by the end of the season.\n\nThe Bad\n\nPerformance of ~15fps and ~45ms latency at full resolution was workable, but still not great. Not exactly a photonvision thing, but worth noting.\n\nChanging camera settings for a pipeline is clumsy and slow most of the time. Sometimes it requires restarting the service. This is confusing if you change the shutter speed, think its good, then reboot, and it becomes way too low.\n\nFiltering tags and getting good results without outliers is actually kind of difficult, and requires some level of understanding and skill. Mechanical Advantage’s thread for this is very good.\n\nThe NT results data can be useful, but it can be difficult to debug what happened during a match, for example, why was a tag not captured at some point in time? Or why is the pose stability suddenly a problem? What I am looking for here is having all video data recorded for playback after a match.\n\nThe Ugly\n\nThe story for how settings work as it stands today is difficult to understand. What I am looking for here is to have a main PC, a backup PC, some amount of cameras that are calibrated, and some amount of pre-calibrated spares. All of these should be interchangeable. The way we operated this year is each camera is given a name, and the serial changed through the Arducam UI to this name. However:\n\nIt took way too long to realize that clicking on the calibration was how to export and import calibrations. This is a different location than other settings import.\n\nI can see why you wanted calibration images to live alongside the calibration itself, however the json becomes way to large and unwieldy. Uploading back to the device can fail, since there is a cap of 50MB. Checking this into version control makes git sad.\n\nThe other settings export and import was similarly fragile, especially when calibrated images are stored here. The exported zip has a bunch of files, and when you go to import settings again back to the device, there are 5 different options. I assume ‘All Settings’ is the zip file? What is hardware configs and hardware settings? What is the format for the others? Lastly, the same 50MB limit is present for the settings, which is easy to surpass. Can I just nuke the files over scp on the device if its too big? (You don’t have to answer these here, just highlighting the thought process).\n\nWe ended up just configuring two PCs manually to be similar to each other, and manually import camera calibration. We also wrote a basic script to strip out all the images from the json so it could be imported and checked into revision control.\n\nWe continue to have the issue where we see ‘Input was empty!’ in the journalctl, but without warning in the API (e.g. heartbeat continues). We had a bug earlier on this, but this was not resolved. Our solution for this was drive team checking manually. Haven’t had time yet to report on Github.\n\nViewing the image from the camera for tuning, calibration, or feedback is painfully slow and laggy. With some cameras it could be as low as <1fps and several seconds of latency, even when plugged directly into the PC. To mitigate this, all calibration was done on a specific laptop, which go okay feedback, but never was smooth for us.",

                    "cooked": "Thank you for developing Photonvision, it really helped us out on our second year using it. Overall we have little complaints over a few small grievances.\n\nThe Good: Worked way better than last year. Calibrating is a breeze, and setting up pipelines felt nice and streamlined. Setting up our co-processor was again very simple. Using photon vision we could see tags about half the field distance away with only about 3-4cm of error. Overall pleased with photonvision this year.\n\nThe Bad More definition of the units in the docs would be great. Me and my team had a lot of trouble configuring robotToCam this year due to a overall lack of documentation on the units of the variables in the docs. Using AdvantageScope helped us figure out this issue, which we did do, admittedly a little late.\n\nThe Ugly Now, I am not sure if this is a photon vision issue, It seems more likely to be a Smart Dashboard (or a skill) issue, but I will mention it none the less. To test that our Odom was correct, we displayed the robot odom on the field2d layout in shuffleboard. During this process, we encountered the hexing issue that when we were on the blue side, we seemed to be 20ish inches closer to targets than we actually were, where as on the red side, with the exact same config, we were near perfect. Eventually we were recommended to check out Odom using AdvantageScope, which (using the same config) correctly displayed our position on both red and blue sides.",

During this process, we encountered the hexing issue that when we were on the blue side, we seemed to be 20ish inches closer to targets than we actually were, where as on the red side, with the exact same config, we were near perfect. Eventually we were recommended to check out Odom using AdvantageScope, which (using the same config) correctly displayed our position on both red and blue sides.\n\nThis was a bug in the kickoff release of Shuffleboard, and was fixed in 2024.2.1.

When the lighting was good, vision was accurate to within a CM in perfect conditions.\n\nBad: On boot-up, cameras sometimes were recognized as new even with no changes until related setting was enabled. This led to us just losing cameras randomly on field until we checked logs and left the robot powered on after a match to investigate.\n\nUgly: GUI frequently didn’t display camera streams until either reloading the webpage or when that didn’t work restarting PV . This was usually triggered by an error in logs saying that the camera was already in use, but I don’t really see how that could be. GUI can also be laggy and just not load different tabs during longer testing sessions until coproc restart.",

It was fast and easy to configure. 2D April Tag detection was also very consistent at detection across many lighting conditions and distances.\n\nBad : We connected two Arducams at once one time, and it didn’t work. We read a few GitHub issues and learned that we needed to use a camera renamer tool. However, Photon did not accept it! When we plugged in the camera to any other device, Mac or Windows, it listed the correct name (AmpCam). But Photon refused, listing both cameras as the same default name. Even when the other one was unplugged, it started naming it “ArduCam (1)(1)(1)(1)(1)(1)(1)(1)(1)(1)(1)(1)(1)(1)” etc. We ran out of time fighting it so ended up only using one of those cameras.\n\nUgly : 3D Calibration was absolutely awful. We followed all of the tips and tricks, tried multiple different cameras, but it was always wrong by a large amount (several meters). We really tried to make 3D mode work, but just couldn’t live with the inaccuracy.\n\nInstead, we tried using 2D mode and doing the trig ourselves based on known AprilTag positions and returned angles from Photon. But turns out, the reported pitch and yaw values were wrong! We had to fit a polynomial curve by measuring out distance from a target and calculating the correct pitch. After doing all that, we were able to get accuracy within a few centimeters. There was a lot of frustration involved in a process that’s advertised to be nearly automatic.",

                    "cooked": "We used PV pretty easily for both 2D AprilTag detection and object detection, with very few issues (once multiple cameras of the same model became supported) It let us get targeting on notes and the speaker down pretty easily and well. Also, not any software stuff, but being able to use a battery pack to power the OPi was pretty nice, as we were demolishing our battery’s (one time at worlds we got down to 6.82V!) and not having to worry about brown outs or boot ups was pretty nice!\n\nThe SD Card seems to get corrupt over time(or that’s what we assume it is). After a certain number of power cycles of the OPi, PV just wont start up anymore, and it just gets stuck in a boot cycle until you replace the SD card. It’s sorta sucky, but I see it as acceptable maintenance.\n\nWe had to make our own way of filtering notes by how close to the center bottom of the camera they were, this was mostly to get around notes sitting next to each other tripping vision up. We also had to use a flashlight to change our cameras exposure, (OV 9782) but I know that support for it is already in the works, so this is sorta a mute point.\n\nAll in all, I’m happy we chose PV this season. It let us use slightly less of our precious power, gave us more frames, let us do global shutter on everything, and all in all, was pretty nice to work with, once the camera matching worked. Great work, guys!",

It would have been helpful to have documentation on where cache is stored (we had our cache get broken initially), how to access journalctl logs for those who aren’t super familiar with Linux, and other important commands that could be useful\n\nStrict matching, there should be a bit more flexibility in what parameters go into strict matching, maybe even some way for users to manually choose which cameras to match instead of having to constantly restart the service\n\nSettings randomly reset, this didn’t start happening until champs, and we had a few matches without our Arducam running the correct pipeline, when looking through the journalctl logs, it looked like the database was somehow getting corrupted. This could possibly be an issue with the coprocessor itself, but there could be some safety backup features to restore the database if it somehow gets corrupted\n\nThis only started happening at champs, but sometimes when the LL3 boots up it gets an error like Unsupported winsys offset of 96000 , it would then keep trying to start the service until the device reboots.\n\nOverall, the flexibility and features that Photonvision provides have been monumental to our team’s programming this year. If it weren’t for PhotonVision, we would have never made it as far as we did this season.",

                    "cooked": "Thank you to the entire PhotonVision team. PhotonVision has become a critical software component on our robot. This year, we ran PhotonVision on 4 Raspberry Pi 5s each with an Arducam OV2311 camera at 1600x1200 resolution. Our only pipeline on each was Aruco with 3D AprilTags.\n\nWe almost always saw multiple tags while driving across the field. At times, we saw 5 or 6 at once.\n\nThe multi-tag algorithm was done on the co-processor to offload that processing from the RIO.\n\nWe didn’t have any issues where the Raspberry Pi’s SD card would be corrupted and require refreshing like we did in 2023.\n\nThe  ambiguity for multi-tag is always reported as 0.2. We couldn’t find any way to get a meaningful ambiguity value associated with the multi-tag algorithm. Often multi-tag was quite accurate, but at times it was off and the lack of a meaningful ambiguity value made it challenging to filter out bad poses.\n\nThe UI to export and import calibration was not obvious (clicking on the row in the camera calibration pane). It would be more intuitive if everything could be exported and imported from the same place.\n\nTuning exposure simply didn’t work on our cameras (a change of 0.1 would have a dramatic effect). The auto exposure toggle seemed to work much better.\n\nWe struggled to calibrate each camera well. More documentation or assistance via the web interface would be appreciated. We didn’t try Mr. Cal. We didn’t use Calibdb since it didn’t support the 1600x1200 resolution. There are a couple of PRs to use ChArUco Boards which sound promising.\n\nAt times, one of the Photonvision servers would report timestamps in the future via NT. This may be more of an NT 4 issue than a Photonvision-specific issue. Regardless, this had a negative impact on our pose estimator. When this occurred, every timestamp until the code was restarted would be in the future. (I think the latency is calculated just once.)",

We couldn’t find any way to get a meaningful ambiguity value associated with the multi-tag algorithm. Often multi-tag was quite accurate, but at times it was off and the lack of a meaningful ambiguity value made it challenging to filter out bad poses.\n\nAmbiguity doesn’t really mean anything in multi-tag, since the solver only considers the best match (though in that case the ambiguity should be 0, so I’m not sure where the 0.2 is coming from).

(and PRs are always welcome)\n\nAnd yep, that’s a NT4 time sync issue that occurs when the Rio can’t keep up with incoming packets (which violates some assumptions libuv makes). We’re considering reinventing PTP-at-home by having the Rio send a UDP multicast packet with the current time periodically next year to avoid this - again, would love contributors to own time sync stuff as well.\n\nAnd if you can open a issue ticket about multi tag ambiguity that would be awesome",

The better metric to use here is reprojection error.\n\nMy mistake! The ambiguity is 0. Our code hard-codes a value of 0.2 in an attempt to use the same algorithm to calculate the standard devision to pass to the pose estimator for single and multi-tag estimates. We will investigate using the reprojection error instead for multi-tag.",

When I was working with a Coral M.2 attachment for note detection early in the year, I couldn’t have both my pipeline and PV running at the same time but it became a moot point.\n\nThe Ugly Keeping configurations. Seemingly at random, PV would forget our cameras, matching them as a new device after a single reboot of the robot. Other times it would seemingly do a hard reboot of all settings, and reloading the saved settings wouldn’t fix anything.\n\nI think that a good update might be to have a way to load configurations from the robot code, similar to how Northstar saves its configs. Photonvision resetting our configs happened far too often, and seriously screwed us in a few elimination matches.",
