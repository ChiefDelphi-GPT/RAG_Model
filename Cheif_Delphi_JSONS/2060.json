I am “concerned” on the $23 increase on the 44.\n\nAdmittedly…I don’t know the performance of the 44 that well.  I have heard it is a strong performer.   However, giving it such an increase…to me raises questions.\n\nLike, can I use it as a drive motor?  Or as a primary motor for elevator?  I mean…for that jump on price…I am surprised drivetrains and teams wouldn’t chose that over the 60 as a primary as a drive motor to lower the weight.\n\nFor the record…I get that the 44 is capable motor.  I will not dispute that. To increase it that much…the tariffs must have been much higher on the 44 than the 60 to bring it to that price point.\n\nI hope that the supply issues will be kept to a minimum…as these tend to be…how shall we say…out of stock consistently.  Especially the 44s…and PowerPole Adapter Board…and…\n\nI would like to know, what each motor capabilities are (not just the specs), like this motor can be used for this…and not used for this.  This is for teams that are not in the know (and me). I don’t want to order the wrong motor for a function and either burn it out because that it was not designed for a task ($218 down the drain) all because I or our team used the wrong tool for the wrong task.\n\nThanks!  Hopefully, these will not go out of stock before we can order a few in September when our budget hits.",

Sure the stator is less copper and steel but the rest of the package is similar and the motor controller costs are probably about the same. It may even be possible the x44 TalonFX is more expensive since it had to be redesigned into that tiny package to fit on the back of the motor.\n\nThe performance increase is that it is significantly smaller and lighter and still very capable. I would say moving forwards you will see teams move to smaller motors when they are sufficient to keep weight down given FIRST took 10lbs away and i expect that will stay.",

I see zero reason why this motor wouldn’t be used by teams for all sorts of mechanisms. I haven’t seen them used as the drive motor in a swerve, but definitely seen them for steering. They’re everywhere on manipulators and elevator systems.\n\nI’d assume a newer motor for wcp has more sunk costs that are reflected in the higher price, if they recouped x60 production costs prior to tariffs.",

Does that make them the same?  Not a proper analogy…both have Vette in the name so I used it.\n\nI understand your points.  They are valid.  To price them the same as they were equals when last year they were $5 off of each other…that is a stretch.  Even before this…I honestly felt it was too close in price.  IF I had to decide (for drive train) between the two…I would buy the 60s.  Not because it was better…just because it would make sense to me.  A $5 difference that a difference.  Had it been a $15 or $20 difference…then I would mix the two.\n\nAnd now with the “narrow” variants coming out…one is forced to potentially go to a 44 for odometry…or a different brand (we will focus on Kraken).  Some are wanting something…smaller.  Using the SDS 5n as an example…they are pretty much “mandating” 60/44 combo when it comes to Kraken (it even looks like the 44 is the only acceptable steering motor regardless of what the drive is). I am not sure what ThriftyBot is going to do (we are looking at the Narrow once it comes out and deciding).",

IF I were to use it out of spec…and no one tells me it was an out of spec issue:   Am I truly at fault?  IF I don’t know…and it wasn’t said I can’t do it…am I truly at fault?\n\nThe rest I agree with.  Common sense would say for me not to use a 44 for a drive motor unless I was under say 50 pounds with bumper and battery.  Or just running the drive base.  I can see this then.\n\nI used specific systems for a reason.  They are expected to do more…and carry more.  They require endurance and power.  This not to say the 44 cannot produce or work.  There are limitations.  Much like the word IF.",

However, giving it such an increase…to me raises questions.\n\nLike, can I use it as a drive motor? Or as a primary motor for elevator? I mean…for that jump on price…I am surprised drivetrains and teams wouldn’t chose that over the 60 as a primary as a drive motor to lower the weight.\n\nOn paper the x44s are roughly comparable to a Falcon 500 (at least in terms of Stall Current, Peak Power, etc), but the biggest difference you’ll see is the x44s have a much lower thermal mass, meaning they’re far more likely to hit the thermal limit and shut down under continuous load than an x60 or an older Falcon 500 would.\n\nThat’s not to say the x44s aren’t still useful, we used them a bunch of them all over our robot this year, but I would hesitate to use them as a drive motor (though swerve steering is fine) or for an elevator that has to hold a position under stall for an extended period (we tried x44s on our elevator and had to swap them for x60s), though the new REV Max Planetary Brake may solve that problem.",

Shrinking technology costs money too, at least in theory. Don’t forget there’s a controller on the back of this thing.",

And I am not mad about doing a mix.  IF it came right down to it…I would do it as a mix.\n\nYou compared it to a Falcon.  We used Falcons on steer this last year.  burned two of them.  I know the 44s have controllers on them…just like the Falcons and the 60s.\n\nAs for shrinking tech…cellphones have either stayed the same as previous years or have dropped.  All while improving the capabilities of the electronics.  Cars have gone up in price as they add more bells and whistles to them.  Most of the parts on both come from out of the country.  I am not mad or questioning this…it is what it is.\n\nEconomically, it depends on the market.  IF the market will bear that increase…it will work.  IF not…it won’t.\n\nIn FIRST , we are only able to use approved vendors, approved motors, and the list goes on.  I can’t design a motor…slap it on a bot and color it good.  It has to be approved.  It has to be tested.\n\nOne thing has stuck out to me about what you have said:  IF the electronics are the hardest thing on the 44…why wasn’t priced the same as the 60 or more before?  It would make sense.  Why wasn’t it done?  Small controllers are able to be done…for a long time now.  I can’t do it…others have.  It isn’t new tech or engineering issues.  It is a tariff issue, I will agree with that.  However, not knowing the actual tariffs between the two motors and their controllers…who is to say.  To say that a 44 is as good as a 60…only in certain applications only IF it is in spec…even if it has a controller built in (which I love and is why Kraken is my choice to use), you aren’t going stick a 4 or 6 cylinder in a Corvette and call it an improved Corvette.  It is like calling the MACH-E a Mustang…it isn’t in my books.  I am not even a Ford fan.\n\nThe 60 is beefier than the 44 regardless of tech.  We can’t compare it to the Falcon because…it is no longer produced.  And the ones that are still out there are dwindling in numbers due to age or breaking down.",
