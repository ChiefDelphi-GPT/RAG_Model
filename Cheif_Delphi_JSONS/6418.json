After I finished removing most of the spaghetti code I wrote in the pits I wanted to do more. During the season I tried (and failed) to get vision based shooting for our robot. One of the problems was that I couldn’t find any good examples to look at. Before I start writing the actual code I want to make sure I understood the math behind vision based shooting. Both for my understanding and everyone else’s I made a graph in Desmos with a visual example of how it works.\n\nHere is the graph",

If you think that wouldn’t work,  how would you calculate a parabola for the note?\n\nAlso, I’m assuming that an interpolation table will work better with more data, which isn’t really option right now. Some teams may have the resources to finish their robot early and have the time for something like that, but mine usually doesn’t. I will definitely try it for the off-season where I have the testing time, but might have to hold of from using that during the season.\n\nIf you know of any other techniques that don’t require as much testing time, I would love to hear them.

With a defined procedure and a bit of practice, extremely accurate and reliable interpolation tables can be made in under an hour (and I bet I could make a serviceable one on a competition practice field in less than half an hour). I will say that making sims helped me speed up the interpolation data gathering process, as I knew what the shooter angle/distance graph was supposed to look like and I could “fill in the dots” between data points.",

As complicated as this looks, it is still making a lot of simplifying assumptions, especially for a flying torus like a Note rather than a sphere.  Disregarding these simplifications that contribute to inaccuracy, you still have a the problem of finding the actual exit velocities of the Notes based on shooter speed.  Unless you are doing something unusual, actual exit velocity is less than theoretical exit velocity based on shooter wheel speed.\n\nmineable3:\n\nAlso, I’m assuming that an interpolation table will work better with more data, which isn’t really option right now. Some teams may have the resources to finish their robot early and have the time for something like that, but mine usually doesn’t.\n\nAn interpolation table IS the fast, low resource way to set up your shooter.  If you have time to run your robot, you can  shoot from a series of distances and dial in shooter speed and launch angle.  We put in a new interpolation table at our first regional in a 15 minute practice field slot when we found that the new Notes being used at the event flew differently than the used Notes we calibrated with at home.\n\nTrying to tune a theoretical model to give performance equal to or better than an interpolation table is going to take longer.  You still need the on-field time to take a range of shots and modify the model parameters to get accurate results.  That’s the best case scenario if you happen to start with a model that is appropriate enough to be tuned.  If you have to modify the model form because no tuning gives you accurate results at all distances, you are looking at way more development time than just experimentally determining an interpolation table with 6-10 points.",

Another problem is that this won’t allow for shooting while moving.\n\nThe reason the note isn’t shot in a straight line, is because of gravity (mostly, we found other forces don’t have much effect here). Here is a desmos example for the physical calculation that takes the shooting wheel speeds (which is the tangential velocity of the wheels, maybe multipled by some coefficient if you see you’re losing some speed), and finds the optimal angle to shot with, considering the note is affected by gravity. Then, we put all of this into a 3d vector, we subtract the robot’s velocity vector, and we get a new vector that compensates for shooting while moving. This is our code.\n\nNote that our solution does require full field localization. But either way, I do recommend having full field localization.",
