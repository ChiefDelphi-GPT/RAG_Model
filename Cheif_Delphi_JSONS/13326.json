                    "cooked": "Hey guys, during the offseason my team was discussing ideas for interesting drivebases that would help us stay competitive in the 2023 season, should holonomic be advantageous.\n\nFor context, we (team 4788!) live in West Australia and we dont have the resources to buy COTS swerve modules. We have experience with West-Coast-Drives and Mechanum, but both have obvious drawbacks that make them less competitive (in most situations) than swerve.\n\nIdeally, the alternative drivebase would allow us to achieve holonomic motion without impeding on normal tank motion- in the case of an experimental drive system failing, we want to be able to just take it off and have a tank drive. It also means we can maintain the pushing power/defence of tank.\n\nThe Plan\n\nThis lead us to a 2-state actuated drivebase we called WASP (West Australia Sideways Propulsion).  The basic idea was to place two pneumatically-actuated omni wheels on the back of a west coast drivebase, with omni wheels on the WCD’s front two wheels.\n\nimage 1347×528 8.92 KB\n\nimage 1347×528 8.92 KB\n\nimage 1347×528 8.92 KB\n\nWhen actuated, none of the (highlighted orange) traction wheels touch the ground.\n\nAfter further research, we found it was really similar to 1939’s drivebase in 2017\n\nwhich used the same concept to drive sideways\n\nIt seems to be forced to move in arcs instead of straight lines since, unlike H drive, the sideways force isn’t applied to the center of the rotation, creating a moment. However, this could just be what they did in the video.\n\nTo achieve straight sideways motion, our solution is to add 4\" mechanums to the front wheels of WCD.\n\nimage 1422×582 14.7 KB\n\nimage 1422×582 14.7 KB\n\nimage 1422×582 14.7 KB\n\nTesting\n\nTo test this, we mounted a perpendicular omni to the back of our 2022 robot, and put mechanums on the front, which worked well, even with full manual controls (tank drive on the thumbsticks, sideways wheel on the triggers).\n\nThe video only shows us moving in arcs but we could go straight, it felt identical to driving mechanum. We also tested driving with the omnis ‘undeployed’. The mechanums do not greatly affect how the normal WCD drives.\n\nCAD version\n\nWe’ve also CADded the module on our WCD to check the piston geometry was possible with 60PSI in a reasonable form factor.\n\nimage 789×488 60.9 KB image 726×393 59.6 KB image 799×242 88.1 KB image 798×248 92 KB image 749×456 68.9 KB\n\nimage 789×488 60.9 KB\n\nimage 789×488 60.9 KB\n\nimage 726×393 59.6 KB\n\nimage 726×393 59.6 KB\n\nimage 799×242 88.1 KB\n\nimage 799×242 88.1 KB\n\nimage 798×248 92 KB\n\nimage 798×248 92 KB\n\nimage 749×456 68.9 KB\n\nimage 749×456 68.9 KB\n\nIn this version we’re using two 32mm bore x 25mm stroke cylinders to lift the robot about 2°.  both rear omnis are driven by a single neo through an in-tube gearbox (We’ll also reconsider the use of the vex gears and mechanum wheels😬)\n\nHeres a link to the inventor files if you wish to check it out.\n\nEvaluation\n\nIn conclusion, with a proper control scheme and the right game field layout, we may consider this drivebase for 2023.\n\nPROS:\n\nCheaper than swerve\n\nCheaper than swerve\n\nCan be used as normal tank in case of module failure\n\nCan be used as normal tank in case of module failure\n\nless motors and complexity\n\nless motors and complexity\n\nCONS:\n\nRequires switching between traction and agility, can’t be simultaneous and more driver dependant\n\nRequires switching between traction and agility, can’t be simultaneous and more driver dependant\n\nBasically unproven in competition\n\nBasically unproven in competition\n\nRequires pneumatics and consumes some air to deploy\n\nRequires pneumatics and consumes some air to deploy\n\nOf course, we haven’t thought of everything.

I was programming lead on 1939 in 2017 when we implemented sidewinder, and It’s great to see someone else trying something similar. I especially like the actuation mechanism which resolves the tight ground clearance that we had with our sidewinder drive.\n\nThe one thing I would add is that our sideways motion got significantly better through out the season. In our robot reveal video you can see how it tended to drive in an arc as you describe. I added a PID controller that tried to use the gyro reading to keep us moving perfectly sideways by causing the front two wheels to spin in opposite directions while we strafed. During the season this software control didn’t work very well. However, the driver got pretty good at apply this counter-rotation manually to improve strafing.\n\nIf I remember correctly though, it turned out that there was a software bug that kept the PID controller from working correctly . After the season, I fixed that bug and it was able to strafe basically perfectly straight side to side. Here’s the code for that, it is any help .",

Great work!\n\nHowever, as an actual competitive concept, I would probably not run this. Because of the way your first post presents the rationale for the design (can’t afford COTS swerve, still looking for holonomic effectiveness) I wonder why you can’t remanufacture an existing swerve design, or come up with a design of your own? Frankly you’ve exhibited the skill, drive, and machining capacity to do it.\n\nThat’s me though, and my advice is based on limited information and a lot of bias. Your team sure looks capable of doing the same kind of work that teams like 3005 have done in the past, and that’s a lot to be proud of, and the foundation for a very successful future. Best of luck to you.",

They drop an omni-wheel in the rear, tilting a portion of the robot, then they turn the tank drive and turn the omni-wheel for super-fast spinning without stopping. In the competition, they only deploy the omni-wheel for a small period of time when need to do a quick 180-degree maneuver to point at the goal without waiting for defenders to keep up. If you look at it you can see they make a super fast turn, while still keeping that forward momentum. H drive (in my humble opinion) sucks most of the time, and in 2014 it would be terrible since that game had a lot of defense to push you around. image 1154×453 38.1 KB\n\nimage 1154×453 38.1 KB\n\nimage 1154×453 38.1 KB",
