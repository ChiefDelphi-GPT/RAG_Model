                    "cooked": "Yeah yeah… my post title is click-bait… it’s on purpose.  I can’t let @Ryan_Swanson have all the fun.  We need to talk though and I need your attention.\n\nSup Chief… it’s your friendly robot network guy here.  You know, the one who helped with writing a paper about how to make robot ethernet more reliable.  The one who has rebooted and flashed these OM5P radios so many times that I built a custom raspbian deployment to make my life easier for it.  The one who told you about the second port being kinda crap… yeah… that guy.\n\nLook… I need you to help me… and by that, I need you to help all of us.  We all want to compete at our best, right?  We are getting ready to go into DCMPs and CMP events and the wireless coverage is about to get worse and the stakes are higher.\n\nSo let’s talk about this for a second.\n\nThere is a set of ambient field radio conditions, in which one robot in a match can lose its radio link and then all other robots on the field will also lose their links and stop/stutter/disconnect/reconnect.  It’s real.\n\nOne robot’s bad radio can take down the other 5. Sometimes it is on disconnect and sometimes it is on reconnect when that radio comes back up.  You can find quite a few matches where this has happened.  I’m not posting any links because I don’t want to call out any teams specifically because that’s not cool… if others want to share them then they can but that’s on them.  The goal here isn’t shaming teams.  It isn’t their fault.\n\nTo be really clear - I’m not blaming the teams here but I do think we can all step up and help each other out with this.\n\nThe FTAs sometimes use the phrase “Christmas Tree” and sometimes they’ll decide to replay the matches where this happens.  Other times, you get stuck in the question box (it’s definitely not an answer box).  You might have DS logs showing disconnects from 1, 3, 6, 10, or even 12 teams all at once even and you might still get ignored and deferred to “HQ” or told “it’s out of my hands”.  That’s ok… let’s not despair.  It’s not the FTA’s fault.  They didn’t pick these radios or the ambient arena wifi conditions.\n\nWell… I’m here to give you some advice and some hope.  Maybe we can all help each other with this.  Check your alliance partners.  Check the opposing alliance.  Verify that they have a solid main battery connection.  Check their radio power pathway and ensure it is fully connected, seated correctly, and that the radio won’t turn off when they drive over a bump on the field or take an impact under defense.  We have to do this for each other because we can’t rely on Inspectors, FTAs, CSAs, and others to catch it.  They just won’t.  Please make sure your radios stay powered on and connected… if not for your sake then for the sake of the other 5 robots on the field.\n\nYou can try reducing your bandwidth usage on the field to below 4 megabits per second and that might help too.\n\nLastly… turn off your personal wifi and personal wifi hotspots.  It’s likely that all of this is ultimately caused by interference and the radios are doing renegotiation to sort out how to deal with the clients (the robots).  We can’t control the venue wifi but we can control our own.  I’m begging you… please help me out here.  Let’s elevate each other and give each other the best experience we can with these radios being what they are.",

I’ll be honest and say that I’m not an RF guy… I’m a network guy… so I really am trying to explore what the technical reason is for it happening.\n\nAs for turning off wifi… you turn it off because even when no one is connected, it is still broadcasting every so often and that’s adding to the amount of radio noise in the air at the event and no, the FMS should really not be running a honeypot… it can barely manage the field.",

Many teams will just twist the wire and insert/strip too much into the Weidmullers. The exposed wire can touch, short or be too loose and disconnect the VRM , PCM or Rio from the PDP .\n\nFerrules will last longer are pretty cheap and once you show a team how to use it they usually will swap everything over to them the next season",

I believe we’re actually running N, not AC.  When a client drops, the AP will stop receiving ack’s and will try to retransmit at lower and lower modulation rates (it’s going to assume that the client is not responding due to increased attenuation).  Since all clients operate on one channel, that’s also going to drop available airtime for other clients.  I think the other clients will stay at the same modulation rate they were at, but they’ll have significantly less airtime to work with until the AP realizes the one client is completely gone and stops trying to retransmit to it.  If the AP drops the rates of all clients down, that’s even worse!  I’m not sure what settings the AP exposes for tuning rate adaptation behavior, but I assume FIRST has looked into what’s available to tune.\n\nSo yes, one robot going offline or with poor radio placement will decrease the airtime available for other robots to get their data through.",

The network is doing some level of queuing and retransmits (yes, even UDP packets get retransmitted on wifi links).
