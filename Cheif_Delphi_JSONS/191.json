Reefscape is my first season in FRC , and as I’ve been looking back at previous games—especially the shooting ones—I’ve always found turrets to be one of the most powerful and fascinating mechanisms. From dynamic targeting to shooting on the fly, it’s easy to see why so many top-tier teams use them.\n\nThat said, while I’m really drawn to the idea of building one, I’m also aware that our team might not yet have the mechanical or programming experience to pull it off reliably. I’d love to hear your thoughts:\n\nHow much time did it take your team to design and build one that worked well?\n\nHave any mid-level teams successfully implemented one?\n\nIn a game like Crescendo , is a turret worth the trade-offs (complexity, weight, tuning) if our goal is to be consistent and reliable?\n\nAlso, realistically, it seems like next year’s game may not even involve shooting (or at least not in a way where a turret would be useful).\n\nThanks in advance for any advice or insight!",

If you have the programming and mechanical knowledge, maybe (look at 254 or 118). With that said, in Israel, that was a very competitive district in 2024, I think that less then 5 robots had a turret. I think that it was not needed to be consistent and reliable (for example, 1690, 4522. both won the championship that year.) The same can be said about a game like 2022, for example, 1577 (worlds finalist) and 1619 (world champs).",

It probably does not increase cycle speed unless there are a lot of game pieces near the target & you can intake/index pieces incredibly quickly. In crescendo, only turrets on cleanup teams came in useful & those teams had well built intakes to be able to effectively use their turrets.\n\nIn conclusion, I love turrets but they likely won’t increase cycle speed unless you find a way to reliable intake and index game pieces.",

If you haven’t done it successfully before, with very limited exceptions, DON’T DO IT!\n\nAs people have mentioned, you don’t really need a turret when your drivebase IS a turret (from what I saw from you TBA you guys do have a swerve) and building a turret, especially when your team hasn’t done it before, takes so much time and effort it takes away from building and optimizing the mechanisms on your robot that matter the most (i.e shooter, intake) for really small speed optimizations.\n\nFor reference, so everybody can see my obsession on hating on turrets, let me tell you my team’s (6377) experience with a turret last season. Firstly, it took up so much space on our bot that we couldn’t even intake correctly at our first comp and had to intake from the source when our priority that season was a ground intake mainly. Then, to even get the turret working, for some reason, our programmers had to write a MATH PAPER on CHINESE REMAINDER THEROM (you really can’t make this stuff up) before the turret even WORKED (winning us the autonomous award at our first comp, but that’s besides the point). Then at our second comp, our turret worked for about like 2 matches, where honestly it actively made our robot WORSE because it would keep swinging around and not letting us intake. It then BROKE our shooter and then when we fixed it for elims NOBODY believed that it was actually fixed. This also happened at our DCMP .\n\nKeep in mind we had a great ground intake, pretty nice shooter, and a crazy amp mechanism making us (IMO) one of the best amp bots in FiT. It was just this turret that really was pretty unesccary that led us to this season.\n\nThank you for listening to my TED talk (rant).",

If you find it doesn’t make sense for you to do on a competition robot, some mechanical and software parts of a turret are useful on other areas of a robot. A few I can think off the top of my head are: tracking and alignment to the scoring target, how to wire manage a rotating mechanism, and how to make the turret spin and accurately read it’s position.",

Slip rings with huge holes are just barely a thing, and a fun combination of spendy and un-reliable.  Plus, powering a serious motor across one is a LOT of current and materials.  If you don’t PLAN in your wire tendering you will be doomed…  It takes a lot of space, and its very easy to mess up and tear them out. We actually built one on a competition robot, sort-of worked out the cable tendering, and finally just bolted that sucker in place because we didn’t have the bandwidth to get it working.",

Anything less than well when building the turret causes it to be actively harmful, with the stiffness loss, extra weight, and packaging disadvantages getting in your way. And this isn’t even getting into the time cost or software issues. For most teams, just the fact they have a turret means they are actively being hindered by it.\n\nThe time when turrets are useful is when you really want to position mechanisms independently of your drivetrain, which isn’t particularly common. It helped 2910 in 2024 due to feeding being a target for defense, but helped minimally for cleanup with 1323 being better than at that role that turret bots. 2022, it helped for shooting while actively being pushed or shooting anywhere from the wall, but otherwise wasn’t helpful.\n\nEven in 2022, which was the best game for turrets ever, turrets weren’t even that large of an advantage, as defense was answered very well with match strategy and driving extremely aggressively and saving 5 or 10lbs helps there quite a lot and having the extra shooter stiffness of no turret was also helpful. In 2020, 1690 did not use a turret and build an extremely stiff shooter and was rewarded for it. Turrets weren’t helpful in 2017 as what mattered more was accuracy, throughput, and hopper space, which turrets hindered all three. 2019, 2016, 2013 and many others had little or negative benefit for turrets for similar reasons.",

For 2024, turrets didn’t see much adoption because the source was on the opposite side of the field so you could position to shoot as you were driving back. Also, only holding a single note means once it’s shot you rush off to grab another, so not much point in turret tracking the goal.\n\nIn comparison, turrets were widely used for 2022 because you could hold two balls and the distance from pickup to score was super small. Some of the best teams would be shooting into the goal while moving to pick up the next piece, without a turret you would need to reposition after every shot, and you would be more prone to being defended.",

Imo with swerve you don’t need a turret to complete the same action, just good code to keep you aligned as you move. Turrets are very hard to make reliable, even for the best of teams. As a driver you become very reliant on your turret functioning in the match. On the other side though, drivers in 2022 with a reliable turret and swerve had a massive advantage as it let them focus on other things during the match",

They’ve been pretty rare since.\n\nSince we’re not allowed to build our own slip rings and appropriate COTS solutions are usually unavailable/unattainable, management of your wiring “umbilical” is often a key challenge.\n\nOne related option that may be worth considering is to rotate just the shooter hood, eliminating any wiring issues.",
