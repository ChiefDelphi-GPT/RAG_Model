Links are available at the bottom of this post.\n\nThe road to get here started in the early off-season and was made possible by the invaluable contributions of alpha and beta testers. Across a total of 16 pre-season releases (8 alpha releases and 8 beta releases) you’ve updated, simulated, generated, closed-looped, and chrp’d your way through testing some of the largest feature additions and changes we’ve ever released. We’d like to give a resounding Thank You! to everyone who’s tested and contributed feedback for Phoenix this year, including all of our test teams, community members, and WPILib developers who helped make this year’s release what it is.\n\nWe’ve captured the major changes and most important reminders below, but there’s too much to fit in one blog! For a full list of changes check out our “New for 2024” page here:\n\nNew for 2024 is the Phoenix 6 library (formerly known as Phoenix Pro). You can find more details and our previous announcement here , with the major points as follows:\n\nPhoenix 6 is the new version of the Phoenix library and is free for all users\n\nPhoenix 6 supports Talon FX (including for Kraken X60), CANcoder, and Pigeon 2.0.\n\nPhoenix 6 and v5 can both be used in the same robot project - simply add both the “Phoenix 6” and “Phoenix 5” vendor dependencies.\n\nPhoenix 5 is not going away and will be supported for the foreseeable future. However, the TalonFX, CANcoder, and Pigeon2 classes in v5 are deprecated (but still present!) for 2024 and will be removed in 2025. We recommend using v6 for these devices instead.\n\nPhoenix 5 does not support the Kraken X60’s Talon FX.\n\nNote: Phoenix 6 is currently available for all FRC languages except LabVIEW. There is a Phoenix 6 LabVIEW alpha being developed for teams who are interested in using Phoenix 6 features in LabVIEW. Teams who are interested in this may reach out to us directly.\n\nPhoenix 5 LabVIEW VIs are available now in the kickoff release.\n\nA migration guide is available here to help you port your Phoenix 5 code to Phoenix 6.\n\nSince Phoenix 6 is freely available, Phoenix Pro no longer requires a separate API. Instead some advanced device features in Phoenix 6 require a Phoenix Pro license. We also have a new licensing type available for 2024 - the Phoenix Pro Season Pass.\n\nYou can see which features require Pro here:\n\nPhoenix 6 Features\n\nAn overview on Season Pass is available here:\n\nPhoenix Pro Licensing: Announcing Season Pass - CTR Electronics\n\nAnd a breakdown of the different license types is available here:\n\nPhoenix Pro\n\nPhoenix Tuner continues to evolve, and Phoenix Tuner X has a full set of new features and improvements to take advantage of, including batch device licensing, plotter improvements, and a swerve robot project generator.\n\nIMPORTANT Note: On computers that already have Tuner X, make sure you have the latest version installed by comparing the version in the upper-left title bar to the latest version listed in the links below. If you need to update, go to Tuner X’s Microsoft Store Page where there will be an “Update” button.\n\nPhoenix 6 is a significant API improvement over Phoenix 5 and has been designed to integrate cleanly with modern programming practices and WPILib.\n\nSee the documentation on Phoenix 6 API usage for full details.\n\nPhoenix 6 has a new API to make programming swerve easier than ever. Tuner X also has a swerve project generator that will create a custom base robot project in Java to get your swerve drive up and running fast with CTRE devices.\n\nThe base generated project works with a gamepad out-of-the-box and can also easily be used with Pathplanner !\n\nPhoenix 6 features a real-time, high-fidelity signal logger that captures every CTRE device data point as it is received from the CAN bus to a .hoot log file. Signal logging is enabled by default during official matches and can be enabled by an API call for all other cases (including simulation and hardware-attached simulation).\n\nUsing the Tuner X log extractor , all users can export common data signals to standard WPILOG format, and Pro users can export a full set of advanced data signals to both WPILOG and MCAP formats.\n\nAs a bonus, thanks to work done by the AdvantageScope developers you can import a Phoenix .hoot log file directly into AdvantageScope !\n\nOur engineers worked with the SysId development team to provide real-world test data and ensure a smooth experience in characterizing mechanisms. All v6 users can utilize the data logged by Phoenix to get an extremely accurate mechanism characterization from SysId by exporting the data to a WPILOG !\n\nAutomatic timestamps of Phoenix logged data also means you can get accurate characterization regardless of which programming language is used.\n\nPhoenix 6 has several new Motion Magic® features . This includes Dynamic Motion Magic® (requires Pro and CANivore) to allow adjusting trajectory constraints during motion, Motion Magic® Velocity to run a velocity motion profile, and Motion Magic® Expo to run an exponential profile using system characteristics.\n\nThere’s too many new additions to link in one blog post, so be sure to read our “ New for 2024 ” documentation!\n\nSoftware Downloads, Documentation, API reference, and Examples can all be found on the main CTRE Phoenix page:\n\nhttps://docs.ctr-electronics.com/\n\nThe latest versions available are:\n\nPhoenix 6: v24.1.0\n\nPhoenix 5: v5.33.0\n\nPhoenix Tuner X: 2024.6.1.0\n\nPhoenix Offline Installer for FRC : v24.1.0.0",

                    "cooked": "2 questions:\n\nSay a TalonFX is being used for a flywheel and is just using the RotorSensor as the FeedbackSensorSourceValue . If the flywheel has a gear ratio of 2:1, a user would then configure the SensorToMechanismRatio to 2 in the FeedbackConfigs configuration.\n\nDo all values in the Slot configs obey the SensorToMechanismRatio ? Say for example, a user has configured a kP to be 4.8 V / RotPerSec . Is that error calculated from the rotor error before or after the SensorToMechanismRatio value?\n\nFurthermore, when setting the velocity, acceleration, and jerk, can we pass in mechanism speeds or does it have to be converted to rotor speeds?\n\nSecond question is about the Phoenix 5 function SetSelectedSensorPosition . How can we reset the rotor sensor to be 0 in Phoenix 6? My first assumption would’ve been to set FeedbackRotorOffset to the current rotor position in FeedbackConfigs configuration, but the docs say that won’t work for anything outside of one rotor rotations. Therefore what would the recommended way be for setting a multi-rotor rotation to 0?",

                    "cooked": "gartaud:\n\nBut will Talon SRX, Victor SPX, and Pigeon 1 still be supported next season when you phase out Phoenix v5 for TalonFX, CANcoder, and Pigeon2?\n\nYes, they will still be supported in Phoenix 5.\n\ngartaud:\n\nWhy doesn’t Kraken support v5 this season since it is Talon-FX based?\n\nThe Kraken X60 requires a different firmware file (Talon FX vers. C). Since Phoenix 5 is deprecated anyways, we decided not to invest our time and resources into back-porting the Talon FX vers. C firmware to Phoenix 5.\n\ngartaud:\n\nHow will Tuner X know if we want to use v5 or v6?\n\nTuner X defaults to the firmware version currently flashed on the device. There is a toggle above the firmware dropdown that selects v5 and v6, as well as one that selects firmware year.\n\ngartaud:\n\nAnd is the old Tuner no longer supported?\n\nTuner v1 is essentially in maintenance mode and will not receive any new features. This means that when used with Phoenix 6, Tuner v1 cannot do much more than set name/ID and field upgrade. Self Test, plotter, log extraction, control, swerve project generator, etc. all require Tuner X.\n\nTotallyNotNero:\n\nOne question - is configFeedbackCoefficient for the CANCoder depreciated in v6?\n\nYes, because CANcoder is now always in canonical units of rotations along with the rest of the Phoenix 6 API. We decided not to support runtime units in Phoenix 6 because we preferred to use the C++ units API (and potentially the Java units API in the future).\n\nIf you want to use CANcoder as a remote sensor, you can use the Talon FX RotorToSensorRatio to specify the gear ratio between the CANcoder and the Talon FX, and the SensorToMechanism ratio to specify the gear ratio between the mechanism and the CANcoder (typically 1.0).",
