                    "cooked": "Hello! My team has just about wrapped up our testing with our new swerve drive and everything has gone perfectly… ish. I have some questions about standard practices with swerve drive as well as motor selection going into the future.\n\nI am wondering if it is common practice to use the absolute encoder solely for zeroing(We have mk4 modules) and then use motor encoders for everything else?\n\nI am wondering if it is common practice to use the absolute encoder solely for zeroing(We have mk4 modules) and then use motor encoders for everything else?\n\nWe have long been a fan of falcons because of their vast amounts of torque and high CPR encoders, but as the community has pointed out, maybe our luck with falcons and vex in general is abnormal. With this in mind, the next obvious choice is Neos but the CPR is only 42 or something similar like that. Is this ok for teams that have used Neos on a swerve drive? Or do you use something else entirely when trying to tune your turning PIDs? Can you connect a cancoder directly to the spark max and use it as a feedback device?\n\nWe have long been a fan of falcons because of their vast amounts of torque and high CPR encoders, but as the community has pointed out, maybe our luck with falcons and vex in general is abnormal.

Can you connect a cancoder directly to the spark max and use it as a feedback device?\n\n2.5 Side note, Falcon Integrated Pids refresh at 1ms, what do Spark Max Integrated Control loops refresh at?\n\nAlong that point, do most teams use integrated PIDs with inputs and outputs in motor ticks? Or is it standard to use WPI Pids. We tried to use WPI Pids but we believe, that because of the 20 ms response time, compared to the 1ms response time between roborio and talonFx integrated PIDs we couldn’t get the modules to turn as fast as desired which led to only ok performance when driving. Have other teams had success with WPI Pids? If so what did your tuning process look like?\n\n3.5 With Control in mind, Wpi is so convenient with profiled pid controllers, regular pid controllers, trapezoidal motion profiles, etc., with features like enableContinuousInput. This feature is so helpful for teams as you don’t need to do the calculations on your end and it’s all taken care of for you. This was originally why we used Wpi pids, simply for ease. Is there any workaround for this that teams should be aware of? Or will vendors implement this into their code eventually?\n\nThank you! Henry M",

Instead, use percent output or voltage for drive, and for turning use the WPILIB PIDController class, using the absolute encoder as feedback*.\n\nFor Falcons, onboard position (turning) and velocity (drive) is usually used. I’ve not really done WPI PID on Falcons, so I can’t speak for that.\n\nOn tuning with WPI: Straighten the wheels, get the output of the absolute encoders and set that as your offset.\n\n* The “yes” only stands with Falcons, who do far better with onboard PID.",

We had a myriad of falcon issues, that have been discussed here , here , here , and here . We’ve already invested heavily in Falcons, and we feel we’ve experienced most of their possible failure modes across our ~160 matches or so played this season/off-season, and here are our takeaways:\n\nCheck the loctite on the falcon screws, and possibly replace with stronger screws that don’t shear as easily. We have been using these screws for our last three off-seasons with no issues since installing them.\n\nSupport the other end of your falcon shafts, and possibly switch to ThriftyBot Keyed Output Shafts they are a single piece of machined stainless steel rather than the standard 2-piece shafts from Vex. These shafts can be used with regular NEO/ CIM pinions as they are 8mm with a 2mm keyway and are tapped on the end for a 10-32 for pinion/pulley retention rather than the annoying press on retaining rings that everyone complains about. This also allows you to use a Falcon500 on a MaxPlanetary gearbox.\n\nThe support for cantilevered shafts also applies in the SDS Mk4 modules. We had several Falcon failures in our swerve modules. If we switch to the Mk4i’s next year, they have the ability to support the Falcon output shaft in a bearing in the top plate (not by default in the base kit), but we are undecided as to whether we’ll be switching to Mk4i’s next year or sticking with Mk4’s (or running a tank drive - pending game announcement). We’ll likely be switching to the ThriftyBot output shafts regardless of which swerve kit we use.\n\nFalcons mounted to a planetary gearbox are supported, and we had zero issues all season with the climber falcons, which were mounted on Falcon Sports from AndyMark",

The same for max acceleration, but here using the measured max was too aggressive and caused transient current faults from the motor controller.  So, it was done by characterizing things and then rounding down and backing off the max acceleration.\n\nThe code linked above has test-mode routines which are used to do this, and to graph the related data.  But in this case, it would have been OK to just guess and refine to get somewhere close.  With these parameters, the I and D terms are zero (good), the P term is large enough so that things track the trapezoid pretty closely all through acceleration/flat/deceleration (good), and the trapezoidal parameters are such that the commanded position is achieved quite quickly.\n\nThe velocity is ~450 RPM and the acceleration is ~3333 RPM/s, so things quickly accelerate and decelerate, and the trapezoid actually does have a flat top on it for large turns.",
