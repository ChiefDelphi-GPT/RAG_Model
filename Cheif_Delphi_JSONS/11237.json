We recommend all users completely reimage/reinstall PhotonVision their coprocessors for this release due to the amount of changes from previous releases.\n\nAprilTag detection and best-in-class pose estimation support that allows you to detect and ignore ambiguous tag measurements, along with more thoroughly documented camera calibration system to help you get up and running with accurate tag pose estimation as fast as possible.\n\nAprilTag detection and best-in-class pose estimation support that allows you to detect and ignore ambiguous tag measurements, along with more thoroughly documented camera calibration system to help you get up and running with accurate tag pose estimation as fast as possible.\n\nPhotonLib updates to support getting your field relative robot pose, and other convenience methods to use with AprilTags. These will help ensure your team has a smooth and easy transition over to AprilTags.\n\nPhotonLib updates to support getting your field relative robot pose, and other convenience methods to use with AprilTags. These will help ensure your team has a smooth and easy transition over to AprilTags.\n\nRobotPoseEstimator class that will combine multiple tag measurements using different “strategies” so you can get your field relative pose in only a few lines of code.\n\nRobotPoseEstimator class that will combine multiple tag measurements using different “strategies” so you can get your field relative pose in only a few lines of code.\n\nCompletely rewritten GPU acceleration support. This brings GPU acceleration for retroreflective tape vision and now AprilTags to the Pi 3 and, for the first time ever, to the Pi 4. This also unlocks support for GPU acceleration on many new global shutter cameras, thanks to libcamera.\n\nCompletely rewritten GPU acceleration support.

Since reliability is so important during this period we try to avoid big changes, and right now there’s nothing super big on the roadmap, although if there turns out to be something seriously needed that’s missing then that could change.\n\nOne exception: there was a new image streaming system and an alternative AprilTag detector that can be a little faster that are mostly working but got cut from this release due to reliability issues. I wouldn’t be surprised to see those in the nearish future.",
