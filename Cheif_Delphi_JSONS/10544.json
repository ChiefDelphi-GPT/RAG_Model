One geared lower to provide high starting torque to overcome inertia and a 2nd motor geared much higher to reach higher top RPMs.\n\nBoth in velocity control mode with profiled velocity ramping so they aren’t fighting against each other.\n\nThe lower geared motor would have to be switched to coast mode once it reached its max RPM.  Then the second motor would be doing all the work up top just like it was a single motor shooter.\n\nObviously the lower geared motor would now be spinning above the “max velocity”.  Issues of concern are the rating of the components inside the motor to handle the higher RPMs and the higher back EMF voltages being induced in the “free spinning motor”.\n\nHas anyone played with this type of setup before?.  I know single direction free wheeling bearings could be employed to release the slower motor or you could add a shifting gearbox, but I’m curious if this really basic setup of different gearing is plausible.\n\nIf this concept works, could it then be employed on the drive motors of a drivebase ?",

I know single direction free wheeling bearings could be employed to release the slower motor or you could add a shifting gearbox, but I’m curious if this really basic setup of different gearing is plausible.\n\nThe correct answer is to use two Falcons to spin up the shooter to high speed before any need for torque comes along and let the momentum deal with that, or have a 2-speed gearbox if you’re really paranoid. For a shooter, there ain’t enough inertia to stop the Falcon for long.\n\nAs far as using it in a drivebase, I would pretty much say “forget it”. If there’s a motor in the drivetrain that can put power to the floor that isn’t doing so, you’re wasting power.\n\nNow, I will say that similar setups have been used in drivebases before, where different motors were geared differently… but they were also attached to different sized wheels to get about the same speed, and this was back before 3-robot alliances when we didn’t have 4 CIMs.",

Modern FRC robots aren’t usually power-limited, they’re either traction-limited or current-limited. In the case of being traction-limited, adding more weight is good! In the case of being current-limited,\n\nThe MK12V battery has a maximum 5-second discharge rate of 270 amps . (That will drop the voltage by 270A * 0.012Ω = 3.24V).\n\nThe SparkMAX and Talon are both rated to handle 60 amps continuously and 100 amps for bursts of 2 seconds\n\nThe PDH 40 amp fuses can pass 60 amps (150% their rated current) for 11 to 500 seconds\n\nThis means that as few as 5 motors can continuously deliver the maximum power that a legal FRC robot is capable of. So using more motors to spread out the load or generated heat, or operate the motors at more-efficient parts of their power curves (to generate more useful work instead of heat), is entirely reasonable.",

If there’s a motor in the drivetrain that can put power to the floor that isn’t doing so, you’re wasting power.\n\nI get that you would be “wasting” power an the top end of the speed curve, but couldn’t you argue that the bottom end (where it is needed in a robot pushing match) would be substantially stronger if the second motor was geared a lot lower than the top end motor.\n\nThe whole idea of this concept is to boost the pushing power at low speeds for ridiculously high geared drivetrains (like 7+ metre/sec) without having to use a shifting gearbox.",

Depending on the motor and its components and how much above that RPM you go, that could be catastrophic.\n\nAs a matter of fact, I wouldn’t test it with a Falcon first. I’d use a brushed motor pairing, because they’re cheaper, then check with the cheapest FRC brushless motor I could get my hands on (sorry, Nidec), then Falcon. (I also wouldn’t use Falcons for this sort of application, because a good working Falcon is a crapshoot right now and I wouldn’t want to risk one.)\n\nThe other option here would probably be a mechanical clutch/release to release the low-speed motor from the high-speed motor. I don’t say it’s a simpler option, because it isn’t, but it’s less gambling.\n\nActually, I can think of an issue. The high-speed motor has to turn both whatever it’s turning and the low-speed motor via its gearbox. This would tend to cause some power loss on the high-speed motor. In a drivetrain this could be mitigated fairly easily (the two motors drive different wheels that aren’t connected) but in a shooter application you may end up running the shooter too slow because you’re dragging the second motor as well as the shooter wheel.",

For example, if you end up running the Falcon at 2x its free speed, you’ ll end up generating ~24V on the terminal of the motor. This voltage will back feed to the supply. With a 12V battery and reasonable wiring, it may keep the voltage down (i.e. by charging the battery), but if the battery, or one of the cables on the motor controller comes loose, you will be essentially powering the device, and other devices on the system, with that 24V. There are already known issues with various control system components and high voltages like that. For example, the Falcon’s bulk capacitors are only rated to 16V. It seems like the falcon has some kind of protection against this, but I doubt it was tested this far outside of its operating range.",

If the potential between U and W exceed the battery voltage + 2 diode drops, then current will flow through SW1 diode and SW6 diode.\n\nThanks @Mark_Wasserman That makes perfect sense now. I forgot about the fly back diodes in the H-Bridges.\n\nAnd that kills the whole idea proposed at the start of this post as even if you put the lower geared motor controller into coast mode, its not going to coast once the back EMF goes over 13.4v (12+0.7+0.7) and that motor controller will be effectively be braking on the higher geared motor with the battery as the sink.\n\nLooks like you have to physically disengage that motor if you want the two speeds.  Glad we didn’t try it.\n\nCheers.",

Although, with Swerve, you could turn off swerve module optimization (ie the never turn more than 90 degrees feature) and always run your Swerve module in the forward direction and rotate the module by 180 when you want to go in the other direction.\n\nBut this could get messy when you are fine adjusting a delivery position because the drive wheel moves slightly as you change the steering angle.",
