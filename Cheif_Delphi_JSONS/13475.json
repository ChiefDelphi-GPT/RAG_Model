                    "cooked": "Does anyone have a design requirement for how stable (i.e. tip resistant) a toolbox or other piece of relatively tall shop equipment should be?\n\nSome googling shows that there are two (voluntary) tests that furniture manufacturers use ( ASTM F2057-19 ). The first is that you be able to open all the drawers and the furniture doesn’t tip, and the other is that a 50 lb load applied to the front of any drawer doesn’t cause the toolbox to tip over.  These seem potentially insufficient for toolboxes given the different loadings (presumably toolboxes have a much higher weight loaded with tools and so 50 lbs isn’t much), and the fact that you don’t anchor toolboxes to the walls like you do furniture (and the 50 lb drawer case is for a child climbing on the drawers, which hopefully should not happen to a toolbox).\n\nI measured my 44\" Harbor Freight US General Toolbox w/ top, and assuming a uniform weight distribution got a fore/aft tipping angle of about 20°. I am not sure how accurate my uniform weight assumption is though (obviously in a dynamic tip scenario I’d expect tools to exacerbate the problem).\n\nI figured maybe someone on here does this in real life and knows what the pros do, or has pondered this in more depth than I have.  Is it just one of those “if it looks like a typical toolbox it’s good”?",

There are a couple of other applicable tests in this standard too.\n\nThe nuclear plants which contract my company consider any unsecured equipment with a CG height to base width ratio greater than 1:1 (the equivalent of a 26 degree tilt table test) to be vulnerable to tipping over in an earthquake.\n\nWhere do FRC Pit Carts fit in this spectrum?  I have no idea - but the middle criteria (10 degree tilt table test, or even a little steeper) seems reasonable to me.",

One session a week or so after a demo where there had been some issue getting the tall (54\"?) toolbox off (or was it on) the trailer, one of the front casters collapsed while a heavy drawer was open, sending the unit on top of one of the students.  Fortunately, several other students and I were nearby.  We managed to slow the fall enough for him to get out of the way.   It turned out that one of the casters had lost three of its four mounting bolts, and was able to swivel towards the center.  We re-built it using larger casters and nylock nuts on all the bolts, and soon afterwards relegated the tall unit to remain at the shop, purchasing a workbench-style box for travel.",
