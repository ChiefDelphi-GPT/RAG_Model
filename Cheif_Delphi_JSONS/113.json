Unlike our competition robots, this one won't have any systems installed. It will include a belly pan, something we’re attempting for the first time. However, our technical understanding in this area is limited. We’d appreciate your feedback regarding robot CAD, particularly on how to properly locate the battery cable connector. Specifically, we're unsure how to route the battery cables to the main breaker and PDH (Power Distribution Hub). Below, I've included a link to the OnShape CAD document for reference. Any insights or guidance you can provide would be invaluable.",

                    "cooked": "n what we did last year...we did a test mule (Milk Crate) of the base as well. It was our first time with swerve.\n\nWe added everything that would be necessary to operate the base...and only the base. From the looks of your base CAD...you need to add controllers (looks like you are running NEOs), and an IMU. This would be the minimum to run it prior to code.\n\nIf the Roborio is in the middle...put the IMU on top of it.\n\nRunning wire to the PDH and the Breaker should be easy on where you have it currently.\n```\nAlright, so I've got this message here that needs cleaning up. Let me read through it carefully. Okay, the user wants me to remove all HTML tags and any unnecessary elements. That means stripping out things like `<p>` tags and any span or template tags. Also, I need to ensure the text flows naturally in standard English, preserving the original meaning. They mentioned keeping it as a single paragraph without line breaks, so I'll need to combine those separate paragraphs into one.\n\nHmm, looking at the first part: \"Based on what we did last year…we did a test mule (Milk Crate) of the base as well.\" There's some ellipsis there which isn't standard, maybe replace that with a period or just keep it if it's intended for emphasis. But since they want standard punctuation, probably a period. Then \"It was our first time with swerve.\" Swerve seems like a brand or specific product, so it's fine to leave it as is.\n\nNext sentence: \"We added everything that would be necessary to operate the base…and only the base.\" Again, the ellipsis can be changed to a period. \"From the looks of your base CAD…you need to add controllers...\" Another ellipsis, same approach. I should also check if \"you're running NEOs\" should be \"you are running NEOs\" for proper grammar. Wait, in the original, it says \"you are running NEOs\", so actually, that's correct. Maybe that part is okay.\n\nThe part about the Roborio: \"IF the Roborio is in the middle…put the IMU on top of it.\" IF should be capitalized as it's the start of a sentence, but considering context, maybe not? Hmm, depends on how formal it needs to be. Since the user wants minimal changes, perhaps leave it as is unless it's incorrect. Actually, in proper English, \"if\" should be lowercase unless it's the beginning of a sentence. So maybe capitalize it.\n\nLastly, \"Running wire to the PDH and the Breaker should be easy on where you have it currently.\" PDH is likely an abbreviation, so that's fine. \"should be easy on\" – does that make sense? Should it be \"should be straightforward\"? Maybe, but the user wants minimal changes. So perhaps just leave it as is unless it's grammatically wrong.\n\nPutting it all together, ensuring all HTML tags are removed, combining the paragraphs, adjusting punctuation, and capitalizing appropriately. Make sure it's a single coherent paragraph without line breaks. Alright, I think that covers the main points. Time to write the cleaned-up version.\n```\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Remove HTML Tags:** Eliminate `<p>` tags and any other non-standard markup to ensure plain text formatting.\n\n2. **Combine Paragraphs:** Merge the separated paragraphs into a single block to maintain a fluid reading flow.\n\n3. **Adjust Punctuation:** Replace ellipses (`…`) with periods (`.`) to adhere to standard English punctuation rules.\n\n4. **Correct Grammar:** Ensure proper capitalization, such as capitalizing \"If\" at the start of a sentence.\n\n5. **Preserve Meaning:** Maintain technical terms and specific details (\"swerve,\" \"PDH,\" etc.) as they hold crucial information.\n\n6. **Final Formatting:** Ensure the text is concise, grammatically correct, and free of unnecessary elements while retaining its original intent.\n\nBy following these steps, the cleaned-up text will be clear, professional, and maintain the integrity of the original message.\n```",

Additionally, we employ a functional 3D-printed bracket to secure the Spark Maxes and minimize cable clutter. Below is a photo illustrating this setup.\n\nWe also utilize NavX2 as our IMU. As previously noted, Roborio serves as the central component, with the IMU mounted on it.\n\nIn terms of the Belly Pan surface area, we find that the current configuration provides adequate space without the need for additional modifications. This chassis functions primarily as a testing platform for software development and ensuring robot stability, without supporting extra systems.",

We did that for the first time this year and it significantly accelerated our early robot progress. We set our size to 27.5 inches by 27.5 inches, and that worked well for us this year. However, depending on your robot architecture, that might not always be feasible—for example, if you're working with something like a 359 requiring a longer robot for the pink arm.  \n\nThe main benefit of doing this is that you can start assembling and wiring your robot chassis before the design is finalized. The same applies to bumper construction.",
