We don’t have the most experience, so an MCC-style robot is the best option for us.\n\nWe decided to build an AMP-only robot that can climb the chain with a teammate. We think this is the best strategy for us because we can make a major contribution towards the MELODY and ENSEMBLE RP during Qualification matches. In Playoffs, we will Amplify our alliance partners’ Speaker shots 3-4 times.\n\nI have attached some images of our intake design:\n\nFloorPickup 1374×616 196 KB AmpScoring 928×1252 161 KB\n\nFloorPickup 1374×616 196 KB\n\nFloorPickup 1374×616 196 KB\n\nAmpScoring 928×1252 161 KB\n\nAmpScoring 928×1252 161 KB\n\nJanky Prototype:\n\nThe intake has 3 rollers and can rotate to score in the AMP or pick up off the ground. Very similar to Penn State Ri3D. For Climbing, we will be using 2 AM Climber in a box kits, one on either side.\n\nHow should I mount the climbers and the rotating arm without them interfering?\n\nHow should I mount the climbers and the rotating arm without them interfering?\n\nHow should I mount the motors powering the 3 rollers?\n\nHow should I mount the motors powering the 3 rollers?\n\nSign in to Onshape, the #1 fastest growing CAD system in the world with over 4 million users.\n\n(Note that the CAD is a work in progress)\n\nThanks for your input!",

Depending on how wide/long your robot is you can either mount the climbers on top of the drivetrain meaning you could be thinner which may help for climbing next to someone or you could mount them on the sides of the intake but inside the chassis. In terms of running the intake, you could probably run it off of one motor if you wanted to by belting the two rollers that go together, together and then by putting a gear on the back roller connected to another gear which is belted to the front independent roller. In terms of rotating your intake I would suggest a gearbox to use multiple motors to rotate it or to get planetary gearboxes to increase the torque of the motor/s to help it move more smoothly.",

You will likely want to use some planetary gearboxes and a final chain reduction, think maybe a 18-24T sprocket on the gearboxes and a ~60tsproket on each of the arm sides.\n\nYou will also probably want to place a pair of gas springs on arm to help counter balance it.\n\nRed is cross shaft, mounted to the uprights with something like an Andymark hex hub with 1.875inch bolt pattern.\n\nYou would have plates attached to the frame with half inch hex bearing for the pivot point and mounts for the motor and small sprockets (orange). You may also put a rev through bore encoder on here as well (purple).\n\nLarge sprockets (green) would be attached to the hex hub (which is also bolted to the arm, it all spins together)\n\nSome gas springs (yellow ) could be attached to the arm to help push it up when it is low to the ground and gravity is acting on a long lever arm.\n\nIntakeBelt__01__01 844×1224 210 KB\n\nIntakeBelt__01__01 844×1224 210 KB\n\nIntakeBelt__01__01 844×1224 210 KB",

We 3d printed the hex nub pictured above, and glued it into the bore of the dead axle. The encoder body was bolted to the wrist itself, so the hex bore stayed still with the dead axle and the body rotated with the wrist.
