                    "cooked": "I saw this announcement today that Autodesk is pulling the plug on HSMWorks.\n\nHSMWorks End Of Life March 25th, 2028\n\nWhat a bummer. Of course the simple answer is switch to Fusion, but is that really so smart? Autodesk has time and again discontinued great software that people love, and/or moved or removed features from certain licensing tiers. So I’m wondering, what are the other options for CAM software these days? Something that we own forever would be cool.\n\nI know Solidworks comes with CAM. Anyone used it? When I looked at it years ago it seemed clunky to use.\n\nAnyone try CAM Workbench in FreeCAD? How is it these days? I’ve heard they’ve made a ton of improvements lately.\n\nCut2D looks like a nice option. Does it do all the things I would want to do?\n\nI thought there was a program called SheetCAM that used to do 2.5D milling, but I’m not finding it these days.\n\nI think Onshape is working on CAM but I don’t think it’s coming to the free or education tiers. Anyone have more info?\n\nYears ago before HSM and Fusion I used OneCNC. Aside from a couple post processor issues, it was a pretty nice software. But, HSM is nicer.\n\nIs CamBam still a thing?\n\nMasterCAM I think is too much of a learning curve, and the licensing is not as accessible.\n\nSo, what are you all using other than HSM and Fusion?",

But I’ve also been using it for 13 years, so it’s part of how I think.  For anyone familiar with “PartWorks” that used to ship with ShopBots, it’s the same software.\n\nVectric’s software is essentially a glorified vector drawing program, and it’s designed primarily for sign makers.  This makes it easy to get started, but causes problems down the line.  I think a lot of their problems would be solved if the two major steps were divided into slightly different interfaces: split “arrange vectors in your material” from “select which vectors to use as the sources for toolpaths”.\n\nI’m perhaps a bit too harsh saying “glorified vector drawing program”; most of the tools work in actual numerical dimensions.  You get a coordinate system with an offset and working area.  For the polyline tool, you can pick a start point using coordinates and type in dX and dY for line segments, and you can move vectors to positions using those coordinates.  Trim, join, polygon, circle, fillet, etc…  It’s pretty close to old-school AutoCAD in most respects, minus the command line.\n\nIf you make a template for your entire machine bed, you can put in your workholding holes, fixtures, etc…and see (and modify) the entire thing at a glance.  I find this particularly important for resuming jobs; you don’t have to write down an origin offset for each part, provided your machine re-homes within tolerances.  Furthermore, if you have a bunch of sheets of material that you’re chewing through gradually, make a file for each and you can see the already-used material when placing new parts.  The caveat is, the program won’t helpfully remind you when you try to mill through a hold-down screw or use reuse material that’s already gone.\n\nIf you need to make some basic shapes, add a mounting hole, or similar, you can do it right from the drawing tools.  We have a standard set of “new sheet workholding holes” that were constructed this way, plus a standard pattern of spoilboard holes.\n\nIt can do corner reliefs (dogbone fillets, T-bone fillets) in the drawing tools, though you have to remember to add them, and you have to set the radius manually.\n\nTabs have plenty of options, and can be placed in the GUI, or semi-automated.\n\nIf you want to duplicate a group of vectors, it lets you spec the edge-to-edge gap, which I love (make the computer do the computer work).  I believe it also copies things like custom tab locations when you do that.\n\nThere’s no adaptive clearing, so your parts aren’t going to be machined as quickly as if you have it.  The pocket tool does offset or raster clearing, with a depth-per-pass and a stepover percentage.  You may find yourself doing more cutouts for large pockets than milling inner pockets into chips as a result, which is kind of a pain.  Hence…tabs.\n\nThere’s no concept of a “part” as a collection of vectors in the software, at least not in the artboard; if you accidentally shift one hole or the part outline, you’re going to end up with scrap.  Note that the arrow keys are one way to move vectors, and they do it quietly for whatever is selected.  You can mitigate this by grouping all of the features of a part immediately after import, placing it, then ungrouping before generating toolpaths, but it’s a worse experience than if there were the concept of a part.  There is the concept of a part when running toolpaths; you can have it cut all of the vectors inside a part, then move onto the next one.  I haven’t used this much; I think you need to set it after you generate toolpaths the conventional way.  Again, I think it would help greatly if there were a “move stuff around” mode and a separate “choose vectors for toolpaths” mode.\n\nThe same goes for scaling: it’s pretty easy to scale things, but as a result, it’s easy to scale things accidentally too.\n\nIf you’re not great with a mouse, or aren’t experienced with selection tools, it can be painfully slow to set up a part with lots of cutouts or holes.  It helps greatly to learn inclusive and exclusive selection are triggered by dragging left and right in the rectangular selection tool.  See above too, though – if you mess up and move everything over…\n\nIf you’re doing 2.5D machining, you need to enter all of your cut depths manually; parts are going to be coming in as 2D vectors only.  This can make the process more error-prone.  Each cut depth gets its own toolpath, which leads to strange cut ordering and clutter too.  If you have overlapping edges in 2.5D parts, that’s where it can get very complicated and frustrating – you can end up cutting air a lot of the time, or leaving thin foil in places.  On the rare occasions we do this, it’s usually a lot of custom work with the drawing tools – polylines, rectangles, trimming, joining, layerswapping.  I used to do this a lot more for personal projects at a makerspace; most of the team parts are straight 2D, so we don’t deal with this often.\n\nThere is a concept of layers, which allows you to preserve your selections of vectors – e.g., put all of the small/mounting holes on one layer so you can return to them later when you generate a toolpath to cut them.\n\nMore complex vectors (e.g., outer profile of a part) will often come in as unconnected pieces and need to be joined into a loop with one of the drawing tools.  The joining tool is semi-automated, and you can usually just select all of the vectors in a part and run it – it’ll ignore anything with a gap greater than the tolerance, including separate closed vectors.  This usually works fine, but if you have two edges on top of each other, it can require some extra work (trimming or manual selection) to fix.\n\nThere is a tool library, and it is pretty quick to set up new tools (compared to CAM software designed for, say, a VMC).  Want to add a new endmill?  Give it the cutting diameter, cutting speeds, spindle speed, stepover, depth-per-pass, and you’re good to go.  A few versions ago, they even added the ability to set up tools per material.  The bad news is, the library isn’t protected super well; you can accidentally change the library tool settings instead of overriding for just a particular toolpath.\n\nCreating toolpaths is pretty straightforward for simple parts; select the vectors to cut, click the button to create the path, then click Generate at the bottom.  But it gets tedious pretty quickly.  For the most part, I want the same two to four toolpaths every time: small holes (i.e., smaller than 2x endmill diameter), big holes/pockets, large inner cutouts, and outer profiles.  Instead of going through and creating these each time, I put one of each in the template.  Before figuring this out, I had a few jobs where I cut on the outside of the small holes, or the inside of the outer profiles.  Also, lead-ins, lead-outs, ramps, and other details differ between the small holes and outer profiles, so it helps to have those saved.\n\nTurning off the “switch to 3D preview after generating toolpaths” option (paraphrasing here) helps with the flow, but also gets rid of the biggest indication that you’ve actually clicked the Generate button.  You can look for the “this is the path the centerline of the tool will take while cutting” lines, but sometimes you have to zoom in for that to be visible.\n\nWhen you click on an already-saved toolpath, it nukes whatever vector selection you had on the artboard and replaces it with whatever was selected for generation last time (which is sometimes nothing, if it’s a new path).  Again, not too bad if you have a part with 3 holes, but awful if you just spent 5 minutes painstakingly selecting every small hole in the batch of 10 gussets you were about to cut.  This is part of why I use the layers – move vectors representing small holes/large holes/outer profiles to their respective layer first, then use each layer to select all the vectors for a toolpath.  It’s too bad toolpaths can’t be set up to pull from a layer automatically, because selecting all vectors on a certain layer is an extra step to remember and takes extra clicks.\n\nExporting toolpaths isn’t super goof-proof.  The default is “export what is highlighted in the toolpaths list”.  My preferred setting is “export all visible toolpaths to a single file”, and to use the visibility checkboxes to choose.  This makes the setting less transient (i.e., you won’t undo it by clicking on the list somewhere).  The caveat, of course, is that sometimes you accidentally export or even just run your hold-down holes twice and plunge right into a screw.  My strategy for avoiding it is to export all toolpaths before starting any of them, and to number the files in the order to be run.",

This makes sense as Autodesk has to pay solidworks for HSMwork.\n\nAs a team, we use F360 and HSMworks. We will be moving to only F360.\n\nFor work, I use PowerMill, F360, Solidworks CAM, and HSMworks. All at pretty good. F360 keeps getting better and really is a really good platform for keeping fixture setups, tool library, job setups, etc. I am not sure why you wouldn’t want to use F360.\n\nSolidworks CAM is also fine for most stuff you would do for FRC as long as they have a post or you edit one to work with your machine setup.\n\nI have wanted to play with SolidCAM for awhile now but haven’t felt the need to. This might push the “go play with it” button to see how it is.\n\n-Ronnie",

I’ve heard they’ve made a ton of improvements lately…\n\nFreeCAD is what I’ve used for all the cnc’d parts for our team for a few years.  It’s been more than adequate for the simple 2.5D work that’s needed for FRC parts.  The only significant recent change for this workbench is the re-name.  It was called the “path” workbench prior to the big 1.0 release and now it’s called the “CAM” workbench.\n\nThere’s the usual hassle of exporting from your design program and importing for CAM, but feature wise it’s pretty good.  You can do adaptive clearing operations and add “dress-ups” to your operations to do lead in/out and add holding tabs.\n\nIt could use improvement in selection work flow and the tool definition seems quirky to me, but since it is free and open source software you don’t have worries about losing access to the program.\n\nI’m eager to hear if anyone else actually uses it.  Sometimes it seems I’m the only one.",

Noticed our educational license expired last week and was informed the below by Autodesk Education Support this afternoon when inquiring how to get it renewed.\n\nAs promised, I contacted the senior team, and I would like to inform you that as part of Autodesk’s recent changes to our product offerings, HSMWorks is no longer included under the free educational license program. This means that renewals using an educational license are no longer supported for this product.\n\nIt seems we will have to figure out an alternative earlier then we at least previously thought. One of our other mentors license does not expire until July so we are at least covered for the near-term, but it’s unfortunate that it was removed from the educational offerings.",
