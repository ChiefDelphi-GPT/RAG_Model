It doesn’t throw any errors, and the robot works fine, I would find it hard to be this because of the inconsistent times that the error is given with the same code, (sometimes the error never happens for hours)\n\nRadio overheating. When we take a break and put fans on the radios (the robot radio and the access point), the disconnects stop. But after a while, they come back, and we get stuck in this cycle where we think we’ve fixed it, but it just happens again.\n\nHere is a DSLog of one of the times that the error ocurred\n\nGoogle Drive file.\n\nWe were wondering if anyone else has had this problem before and if there’s something we might be doing wrong. Any ideas or advice would be super helpful",

Eventually looked at the wpilog and found what is shown in the attachment: the server repeatedly logs a shuffleboard connection followed 1/2 second later by a disconnection and then another connection a half second after that. This continued from before the match until it was over. Shuffledboard on the driverstation never showed that it was connected. The team reported that they had no luck with Elastic or SmartDashboard either.\n![](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T99Q4Q1PE-F08FK9A15PF/image.png)\n\nA second team reported similar inability to get their dashboard to connect but I do not have a wpilog for them. \n\nI learned that both teams were showing driver camera streams on their driverstation computers without any attempt to control the camera stream bandwidth. Both teams stated they could do without the camera streams and turned them off. They had no further problems with dashboard connection throughout the competition.\n\nMy best guess is that the on-field bandwidth limiting is triggering this behavior but I don't know enough about how either the bandwidth limiting works or how NT4 decides that a connection isn't viable (and therefore ends it) to be sure this is the reason. I don't have an adequate model that would explain how bandwidth-limiting would lead to this particular behavior of NT, but so far it is the only scenario I've managed to posit that matches the observations.\n\nIt would be helpful for CSAs to know if on-field bandwidth limiting is the cause of this behavior or if there is some other root cause that we should be looking for.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f6f39f5-b9f7-4e3f-a9fe-ea1f5728b7c4)\n\n**Describe the bug**\nI helped a team this weekend that could get no dashboard di … splayed on-field during competition but it worked fine in the pits.

                    "cooked": "Our loop times are typically <8ms, so I don’t believe we’re using up all the CPU. DS reported cpu usage is usually slightly below 90%. The disconnects still happen while the thread isn’t set to real time priority yet. Everything also typically works fine with the higher priority. It will just fail to connect a bunch of times, but when it finally succeeds it will stay connected without issue for as long as we leave code running. This issue definitely happened for us before we set a higher thread priority at all, setting it higher just made it more common. Also, nothing else has any issues during these disconnects. Dashboards, advantagescope, glass, etc connect fine and keep receiving continuous data from the server. Only our limelights have this connection failure loop. They are still networked fine, and we can access their web dashboards/stream the camera uninterrupted. Just the NT connection has issues. It’s not just failing to connect or randomly disconnecting either, it’s connecting to the server, then immediately being disconnected.\n\nIdk if this is a limelight problem or not, but our symptoms sound very similar to what some others have described, so thought I’d chime in.",

In particular how are the limelights networked with the Rio? What is in the network path between the DS and the robot? Which firmware are you running on the robot and access point radios (if you’re using an access point)?\n\nAnd I second the request for wireshark logs if you can obtain them. Those would be very useful.",

One thing I noticed is you have a client, identifying itself as “DartClient” on 10.11.56.21 (not shown on your diagram) that appears to be making multiple simultaneous NT4 connections. That is at least odd. But the first of those only occurs 3 seconds after the first disconnection at 87.073 seconds by the photonvision device. But that’s in itself odd because there is no prior connection message for that device.\n\nWhatever that program is, if it produces any local messages on the computer where it is running, those may be helpful.\n\nI also see quite a few loop overrruns so maybe what you’re seeing is akin to what @mjansen4857 is seeing.",
