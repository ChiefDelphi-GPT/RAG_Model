We would like to, if possible, use NEO Rev1/.1s (Also, would you advise against mixing these?) as our drive motors, and were wondering if it was possible to use NEO 550s as the azimuth/turning motor.\n\nIs this feasible? Is there a product we would need to purchase in order to use the pinion. Is there an alternative mounting plate we need to buy/make. We don’t have access to a mill ourselves, but we have 3d printers and can commission a machine shop if we need to.",

I understand a few hundred dollars in difference is relevant, but factor in the time cost of anything associated with using a neo550 in an MK4 module, as well as the cost of not having code from other teams you can quickly use once your swerve is assembled. You would likely save yourself days, if not weeks, in machining and programming headaches by just going with neos/sparks or even new krakens.\n\nmaxswerve or the WCP Swerve XS would fit what you currently have, or make specific fund raising efforts for additional neos/sparkmaxes. I definitely feel the latter is worth the effort.\n\nYou can also reach out to teams in your area who might be switching over to the Vortex and Spark Flex or Krakens and are looking to get rid of Neos and Spark Maxes at a discount or possibly even for free.",

Swerve can be daunting for a lot of teams, but it doesn’t have to be if you use hardware that many others are using. Makes the transition much much easier. The Swerve XS is a new product, it might not have high adoption rates like the SDS MK4, the WCP Swerve X, or the MaxSwerve.",

One of my main concerns with this is, with so many companies releasing swerve, how many of these will still exist in 5 years when we need to buy parts?\n\nI understand that this a bad idea, and if we did this it would likely only be for one season. $250 of motors is expensive, but it’s not the biggest pill we’ve had to swallow (our mill and bandsaw both broke last year and had to be replaced).\n\nMy first choice would be Kraken X60s on MK4is. I’m currently just trying to price out my options and give these to the business team. It would be great to be able to buy enough Krakens and MK4i modules to run it at a competition, but with cold spares being a concern it skyrockets the price up to almost $6,000.\n\nCD isn’t allowing me to attach my spreadsheet with this info. I’ll throw a screenshot below. When it says “ BARE MINIMUM PRICE ,” it’s the price for 4 modules and the associated motors (plus a few extra treads/wheels). The Cum. Price is the total cost minus parts we own. It seems expensive, and I feel like there should be a way to get this cheaper. image 969×460 73.3 KB\n\nimage 969×460 73.3 KB\n\nimage 969×460 73.3 KB",

The NEO 550 has twice the free speed of the NEO, and only ~35% of the stall torque. Given the size of the NEO 550, I’d be concerned about it getting dangerously hot at that gearing without substantial testing.\n\nFor reference, MAXSwerve is designed specifically for the NEO 550 and has over twice as much total reduction as a NEO 550 would adapted into a SDS module with no additional gearbox.\n\nsilvanathecat:\n\nCD isn’t allowing me to attach my spreadsheet with this info. I’ll throw a screenshot below. When it says “ BARE MINIMUM PRICE ,” it’s the price for 4 modules and the associated motors (plus a few extra treads/wheels). The Cum. Price is the total cost minus parts we own. It seems expensive, and I feel like there should be a way to get this cheaper.\n\nWe’ve always gotten by with just one spare module, and across four full seasons of swerve we have yet to even need that. If cash is an issue, I’d be comfortable taking a full module off that spreadsheet for each option.\n\nYour motor counts also don’t line up. Is there a reason you’re ordering an extra set of motors and controllers on top of the extra sets you’re already ordering for the extra modules? My team at this point just uses the SPARK MAX and NEO everywhere, so rather than a dedicated drivetrain spare, we have a few spares for the entire robot. You seem like you’re already using them as well, so I’m not sure why spares would be a swerve-specific cost. (For reference, the only swerve motor we’ve ever replaced was a Falcon 500 that got crushed on a MK4 during contact inside our frame perimeter.)\n\nWhy the negative note on MAXSwerve? It had one widespread issue with the plastic wheel in its debut season that has been well-documented and resolved - and based on your price of $320 and not $305, you’d be splurging for the aluminum wheels anyway. While I’ve loved all of our SDS modules (we’ve used MK2, MK4, and MK4i), we bought them before MAXSwerve released. If I was on a team looking at swerve for the first time in 2024 and money was at all tight, I’d be happy ordering MAXSwerve.\n\nWe also find the black neoprene is good for more than one event. 25 extra pieces of tread is very excessive, unless you’re fortunate enough to be getting hours of practice in everyday by February.",

Our standard practice has been to have only one spare module and it has been many years since we have actually needed to use it. If you have motors on your spare module, then you can always swap one of  those motors onto an otherwise good module if you have a motor failure. So, I would not plan to purchase any more than 5 modules and 10 motors.\n\nThere are a couple of other options to consider for the SDS modules.\n\nYou could use Kraken motors as the drive motor and take advantage of the higher efficiency and higher performance for speed/acceleration and then use NEOs for steering. Since you already own 4 NEOs, that would help your budget a lot.\n\nYou could use Kraken motors as the drive motor and take advantage of the higher efficiency and higher performance for speed/acceleration and then use NEOs for steering.

                    "cooked": "There is much discussion on Colson wheels for swerve in several other threads.\n\nI recommend reading this thread (which has some embedded links to the others)\n\nWe used colson wheels on our custom swerve prior to 2023. In 2023 we switched to the SDS modules and the treaded wheels. So we have some experience with each.\n\nThe main advantage we were expecting with tread over Colsons was a higher Coefficient of Friction. This, in theory, gives you better acceleration and pushing power if you are traction limited. Some recent testing by Spectrum and Vex offered some contradictory data on what the CoF differences are between Colson wheels and Treaded Wheels. But both test do seem to confirm that treaded wheels offer a higher CoF than Colson wheels. I can’t say that we saw a huge advantage from this, but we really did not run them back to back on the same robot, so it is hard to say.\n\nThe main disadvantage of treaded wheels that we were expecting was tread wear (and frequent changes). I will say that we did not really experience this problem. We had similar levels of wheel wear and changes between both. But the colson wheels we had previously used were 3/4\" wide and had a thin layer of the rubber material over the hard plastic core. The wider wheels that SDS is using have much thicker rubber and many teams are reporting really good wear characteristics from these wheels.\n\nAnother concern that was raised in previous seasons with tread wheels was a perceived increase in field damage potential (burning a hole in the carpet if the wheels were spinning). I think this has basically been disproven at this point. Most wheels can burn a hole in the carpet if you let them spin while not moving (pushing against the wall or another robot).\n\nHope this helps.",
