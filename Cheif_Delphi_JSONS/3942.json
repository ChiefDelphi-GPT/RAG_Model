                    "cooked": "Hey guys, we’re having some major difficulties with cutting aluminum on our CNC, and we’re hoping we could receive some advice on how to fix our problem.\n\nRecently, when we try to cut aluminum on our CNC, the chips don’t really fly away, and instead bunch up, causing them to get in the way of the end mill during future passes.  This especially happens during pocketing and profiling operations.  We call this “melted butter”\n\nimage 1170×2532 5.77 MB\n\nimage 1170×2532 5.77 MB\n\nimage 1170×2532 5.77 MB\n\nWe’ve tried a few feeds and speeds combinations, but here’s what we have right now:\n\n-4mm 1 flute end mill (from thriftybot) -20k rpm spindle speed -20 ipm cutting feedrate -0.03 inch pass depth -Aluminum 6061 (normally either 1/4\" or 1/8\" thick)\n\nNotably, we don’t have a constant stream of coolant shooting at the end mill; we only have an air hose that somewhat helps with cooling and chip removal.  The melted butter constantly gets in the way of the end mills during passes and sometimes breaks the end mill.\n\nCan anyone help us solve our problem?  If any more details are necessary, I’d be more than happy to provide any information.  Thanks!",

                    "cooked": "I am not an expert but know enough to be dangerous and have had exactly this problem when we started trying aluminum.\n\nWe just got a CNC this year (MillRight PowerRoute Plus) that is capable of doing aluminum.  We are also fortunate to have a mentor who is a CNC programmer so he really helped dial in our feeds and speeds.  The 1 flute that you have should work.  We use a 3-flute uncoated carbide bit for aluminum  ( 4mm Shank Carbide End Mills for Aluminum Cutting, 3 Flutes, Highly Polished Upcut Spiral Aluminum Router Bit. Plunging Application, Applicable for Various Types of Aluminum Extra Long: Amazon.com: Industrial & Scientific ) and a 1-flute (O-flute) for polycarb and HDPE.  4mm is definitely the most useful for most work we do and much less likely to break than a 1/8\".     Anything bigger then 4mm doesn’t work for a lot of the holes we want to make/bore.\n\nI think from the look of your metal you have too fast of a spindle speed and too slow of a feed speed.  Depth of 0.03 should be fine but sometimes we step back to 0.025.   Our feed with that exact bit works at 32 or 36 ipm with 10,000 RPM .   I think you are melting the aluminum and it will get stuck in the flute or make this mess.\n\nThe other thing to check and double check is the bit in the collet. We had replaced a bit and right away all aluminum cuts looked just like yours – found out the collet was not fully seated in the spindle and that the bit was not perfectly straight.  A little wobble makes a mess.\n\nWe have a coolant tank in addition to the air nozzle just like yours that help a lot.    For $99  (and a compressor) this works great. Coolant Lubrication Spray System, Self-priming Micro-mist Machine for Air Pipe CNC Lathe Milling Drill Machine - Amazon.com .   We have some water soluble lubricant that mixes 10:1 in water but I don’t remember what it is called.  Something like this should work. https://www.mscdirect.com/product/details/00063933?srsltid=AfmBOoogQgm6vksw9QGaX_JcK8m4zCVhpd1-1CLNfC_6sEsI__xHcL7pgpA&gQT=1 .\n\nAlternatively use a small amount of WD-40.  That work very very well but is harder to clean up.  Put some at the tip every few seconds until you get a channel then when you get a channel, put some ahead of the cut and vacuum clear behind it.  Even if you don’t get chips flying, this slurry will make your cuts clean.   Before we got the mister/air WD-40 worked very well and we still use that if we are making a deep 2D contour where the sprayer just can’t get into the slot.  We just carved out a complex 3x11\" long piece from 5/8\" thick plate with a 4mm bit on Friday using mostly WD40 in front of the bit and vacuum behind–took 90 minutes but was beautiful.\n\nFeel free to message me directly if you want or add more discussion questions here.",

Your RPM looks good but you might want to increase your feedrate (somewhere between 50-60ipm) and decrease your depth of cut. Better to take a bunch of shallow cuts quickly when your working at those RPMs and a small endmill.\n\nWe’ve used some feeds and speeds that someone posted in an Omio thread a while back, but even with those we have issues cutting aluminum with anything smaller than a 1/4\" endmill to the point where we try to avoid it if at all possible.\n\nJamesCH95:\n\nCutter is dull.\n\nReplace cutter. Run .06-.10 DOC and Yolo it.\n\nWe don’t even run our 1/4\" endmills this deep. If we tried this on a 1/8\" endmill it would snap immediately, even if it was brand new.",

We typically only cut .010-.015\" through the bottom of our stock. That spoil material is still being cut by the end mill, so excessive cut through can clog the flutes with MDF before if even gets a chance to evacuate the aluminum. Using coolant can also cause the MDF to turn into a sticky paste in your flutes, making chip extraction even more challenging.",

They are no good for aluminum simply because they are not rigid enough. Try TTB bits if you have metric collets. Some options from Amazon in English sizes that I have liked include:\n\nSpeTool O Flute UpCut 1/2 inch Carbide End Mill Single Flute Spiral CNC Router Bit 1/4 inch Shank Aluminum Acrylic Cutter: Amazon.com: Industrial & Scientific\n\n$9.19\n\nSpeTool O Flute UpCut 1/2 inch Carbide End Mill Single Flute Spiral CNC Router Bit 1/4 inch Shank Aluminum Acrylic Cutter: Amazon.com: Industrial & Scientific\n\n$9.19\n\n(These do okay in aluminum, but not as good as a TTB 4mm bit or the 1/4 DOC Onsrund but)",
