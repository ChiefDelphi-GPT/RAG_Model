I am a programmer on an FRC team and during this season, REEFSCAPE, my team came to use elements that we had never seen before, since we are a somewhat new team. I would like to know if your team also had any electrical or programming resources or strategies that they had not used before, if so, what was it? How was it used? How did it impact your robot? I thank you in advance for your answer.",

We abandoned using it however just because we found it better to rely upon individual field element tags rather than a complete field map, and that we weren’t especially skilled for making it work during the field calibration period (which at champs we were only given 15 minutes the first time).\n\nAnyhow, I think it is an excellent new tool and hope to continue to use it.  I would maybe suggest that each event field find a way to aid in using this tool in the future.  I think field calibration time is so short and busy to capture the needed videos.  Maybe some of the mapping could be standardized each game and then each field could provide videos to all teams in advance, so that they can film without a really busy field full of people and robots.  Just my two thoughts.",

Also used Pathplanner. 2024 we had some vision but our drivers did not use it as much. Mostly a team rebuild year. 2025 mechanically nothing changed but we had new pose estimation with Limelight. Rn we are working on implementing Advantage Scope/Kit. Strategy wise: on the programming side, read all the documentation twice. There is so much stuff that goes into everything. Electoral wise, get it as early as possible and learn its ins and out. Hopefully this helped!!",

Sadly, we never had a consistent enough auto-align for the system to be worth using. (During off-season, we’re going to be redoing much of the software on the robot, and we’ve already started on better aligning)\n\nIt may not have worked well this season, but it did let us work with autonomous routines, which makes me incredibly happy.\n\nWe also worked with AdvantageScope in a small capacity, and used it during an event to let visitors drive the robot in simulation.",
