I'm curious if other teams have adopted any unique or previously unutilized resources, particularly in the areas of electricity or programming. Could you share any such resources you've discovered or strategies that stood out to you? How did these resources contribute to your robot's performance? Any insights you have would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThis version improves readability while preserving the original message.\n```\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to help the user clean up their text. They provided a chunk of HTML code within angle brackets and explained what they want done. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice the text starts with <p> and ends with </p>. Since they want HTML tags removed, I'll take those out. Also, there's a span with class \"abbreviation\" and a template tag. Those should go away too, leaving just FRC.\n\nNext, the original message has some run-on sentences and needs proper punctuation. For example, \"REEFSCAPE, my team...\" should be split into two sentences for clarity. Also, the exclamation marks after \"good morning\" and at the end might be overused, so replacing them with periods seems better.\n\nThe user wants a single paragraph without line breaks, so I'll ensure the text flows smoothly. I'll check for any redundant phrases, like \"I thank you in advance,\" which can be simplified to \"Thank you in advance.\"\n\nAlso, the assistant's response is provided as an example, and it looks cleaner and more grammatically correct. I should model mine similarly, keeping it natural and easy to understand without changing the original intent too much.\n\nFinally, I'll make sure to keep it concise and focused on the main question about new resources, ensuring the cleaned-up text maintains the original meaning without unnecessary changes.\n```\n\nAlright, now let me put it all together in a clear, step-by-step explanation.\n```plaintext\nStep 1: Remove all HTML tags from the text.\n- Extract the content inside the <p> and </p> tags.\n- Eliminate any other HTML elements like <span>, <template>, etc.\n\nStep 2: Correct punctuation and formatting.\n- Add appropriate periods where needed.\n- Ensure smooth transitions between ideas.\n- Remove redundant or unnecessarily repeated words.\n\nStep 3: Formulate a coherent, single paragraph.\n- Combine related thoughts logically.\n- Maintain the original intent and message structure.\n\nStep 4: Preserve the original meaning while enhancing readability.\n- Keep technical terms intact (e.g., FRC, REEFSCAPE).\n- Simplify complex structures without losing clarity.\n\nFinal Output:\nGood morning! I am a programmer on an FRC team named REEFSCAPE. As a relatively new team, we've encountered and utilized several new tools and resources this season. I'm curious if other teams have adopted any unique or previously unutilized resources, particularly in the areas of electricity or programming. Could you share any such resources you've discovered or strategies that stood out to you? How did these resources contribute to your robot's performance? Any insights you have would be greatly appreciated.\n```\n\nThis process ensures the text is clean, grammatically correct, and maintains the original message effectively.\n```",

However, we decided not to use it further because we preferred relying on individual field element tags and felt unprepared to calibrate it effectively during limited time periods, such as the 15-minute window at champs.\n\nDespite this, I believe WPICal is a promising tool and hope to explore its continued use in the future. I would suggest that event fields consider ways to integrate this tool more efficiently. Given the brief calibration time and the忙碌的现场环境，预先标准化地图并提前提供视频给所有团队可能是一个有效的解决方案，以减少现场的人数和机器人，从而更轻松地进行拍摄。这些只是我的两个想法。",

In 2023, we implemented Swerve Drive for the first time and also utilized Pathplanner. In 2024, we had some vision but our drivers didn't utilize it as much. It was mostly a team rebuild year. In 2025, mechanically, nothing changed, but we introduced new pose estimation using Limelight. Currently, we're working on implementing Advantage Scope/Kit. Strategically, on the programming side, I reviewed all the documentation twice because there's a lot of information involved.

My plan was to share a QR code or something at the venue with the generated ATFL, but of course, it wasn't accurate enough to warrant that.

Unfortunately, we didn’t achieve consistent enough auto-alignments to make the system viable. During the off-season, we plan to overhaul much of the robot's software and have already begun improving alignment. While the system didn’t perform well this season, it enabled us to work with autonomous routines, which brings me considerable satisfaction. Additionally, we collaborated with AdvantageScope on a limited basis and utilized it during an event to allow visitors to control the robot in simulations.",
