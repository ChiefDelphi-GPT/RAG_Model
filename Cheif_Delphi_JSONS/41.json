I am a programmer on an FRC team named reefscAPE, and during this season, we encountered elements we had never used before since we are a relatively new team. I would like to learn if other teams have had similar experiences with electrical or programming resources or strategies they haven’t used before. If so, could you share what it was, how you applied it, and how it impacted your robot? Thank you in advance for your insights.",

However, we abandoned using it because we found it better to rely on individual field element tags rather than a complete field map, and because we weren’t especially skilled at making it work during the field calibration period, which at champs we were only given 15 minutes the first time.\n\nAnyhow, I think it is an excellent new tool and hope to continue to use it. I would suggest that each event field find a way to aid in using this tool in the future. I think field calibration time is so short and busy to capture the needed videos. Maybe some of the mapping could be standardized each game, and then each field could provide videos to all teams in advance, so that they can film without a really busy field full of people and robots. Just my two thoughts.",

Unfortunately, our efforts to create a reliable auto-alignment were inconsistent, rendering the system less effective. Nonetheless, we managed to implement autonomous routines, which brought us considerable satisfaction. Additionally, we worked with AdvantageScope to some extent and utilized their platform during an event to allow visitors to simulate driving the robot.",
