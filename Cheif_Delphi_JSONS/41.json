I’m a programmer on an FRC team and during this season, REEFSCAPE, my team encountered elements we hadn’t seen before because we’re relatively new to competition. I’d love to hear if your team has used any electrical or programming resources or strategies that were novel. If so, what was it, how was it applied, and how did it affect your robot? Thank you in advance for your insights.",

However, we decided to avoid using it entirely because relying on individual field element tags was simpler, and we lacked the skills to operate it effectively during the calibration period—given limited time, such as the 15 minutes we were provided initially.  \n\nIn any case, I believe WPICal is an excellent resource and am hopeful to continue using it. I’d like to suggest that each event field find ways to improve its use in the future. I think the calibration time is too constrained, and organizing mapping tasks beforehand could streamline the process, allowing teams to focus on filming without being overwhelmed by a busy field filled with people and robots.",

By 2023, we incorporated a Swerve drive for the first time and also made use of Pathplanner. However, 2024 proved mostly a team rebuilding year. Although mechanically nothing changed in 2025, we did introduce new pose estimation capabilities using Limelight. Additionally, we’re currently working on integrating Advantage Scope/Kit. From a strategy standpoint, our focus has been to thoroughly read all documentation twice, recognizing the extensive detail involved in every aspect. Prioritizing learning and understanding the system as early as possible has been key. Hopefully, this approach has proven helpful.",

A QR code or similar method didn't prove reliable enough for my plans.\n\nOne of the generated images I obtained proved useful, though its quality left room for improvement.

Unfortunately, the auto-align system's performance wasn't consistent enough to justify its use; however, plans are underway to enhance the system during off-season preparations, aiming to improve alignment capabilities.\n\nWhile the system didn't perform optimally this season, it provided valuable experience in developing autonomous routines, which holds significant personal satisfaction. Additionally, we leveraged AdvantageScope in limited capacity, utilizing it during an event to allow visitors to interact with the robot in a simulated environment.",
