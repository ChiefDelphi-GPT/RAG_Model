Our parts are commonly used within the FIRST Robotics Competition and the FIRST Tech...\n\nPrice: USD 300\n\nWondering how this performs, pro/cons, tradeoffs between others. Comparing the CADs, this module seems to have the most compact and least amount of # of parts compared to modules from SDS and WCP. This design is similar to Thrifty Swerve.\n\nThanks",

Released just back in November:\n\nREV Robotics - 2022/23 Product Releases & Updates General Forum\n\n3739 has been running them this season, and I’m thrilled with them. We’ve not run swerve before, but the example code provided helped us get up and running very quickly, and the modules themselves have been very robust thus far.\n\nTheir overall size is amazing too; Their size is just absolutely ridiculously tiny! We built our robot on a 24x24in chassis this year, and would have been hard pressed to have done that with modules any bigger than these.\n\nCurrently there is some concern with the default/stock wheels wearing too quickly, and in some cases the tread popping off the molded wheel:\n\nMAXSwerve Wheel tread failures General Forum\n\nWe went through 2 sets of wheels at our week 1 event. We loaded in with the original wheels that shipped with the module kits, replaced those a few matches in due to worn tread (those wheels had been used all through build season for testing/driver practice too), then the new wheels failed in our last (maybe second last ) qualification match where we swapped out for another set of wheels going into elims.\n\nREV is already working hard to ensure teams have enough wheels to compete, and have solutions for the wheel issues already in the pipeline:\n\nMAXSwerve Wheel tread failures General Forum\n\nThe 1st module was a little tough to put together the first time, but once we figured out how to put the 1st one together properly, the others went together very smoothly.\n\nOver-all I’d say we’re quite happy with our purchase/investment, and would recommend REV and their MAX Swerve to others looking to purchase some modules.",

There’s around 2.75in of ground clearance which was plenty for this years game.\n\nAs for motors, we ran NEO’s on ours. We owned and ran falcons since 2020, but sold them this past fall due to the mass amounts of issues surrounding them.\n\nThe NEO’s have Integrated encoders in them just like the falcons. As @Rohit_Seshadri said, regardless of the Integrated encoders, you should still run the absolute encoders on the modules for accurate positioning/tracking of your module rotation across power cycles.\n\nThe MAXSwerve modules include the encoders anyhow (it’s not an additional cost like with a lot of other modules on the market), so there’s really no harm in running them. You’d also likely need to make some form of spacer to take-up the missing space that the encoder would typically occupy on the shaft.",

Only team there with REV swerve this year, but later on several came to ask about it.  We wouldn’t have placed top 8 without it.\n\nWe used the high speed and mostly the stock template.  It looked fast compared to some others on the field.\n\nWe changed before, after first quals day, and only had a single bad wheel after last quals match, Anyhow having 3 sets of wheels per competition is probably good idea and changing before problems occur.\n\nedit: I should add we weighed like 75 lbs which added to quickness.  Around 2 minute mark we end up leaving the substation with our quals partner and champion, at same time, and it was one time it just looked quick, like we were in a drag race of sorts.

It s our project this summer with my kids to get them to get hands on learning about Motor, Drivetrain, control, as well as programming. My plan is to build the flat chassis with 2 swerves diagonally and have 2 casters. Not sure how well this is going to work, so anyone who has experience on this please chime in. This is not a comp bot in any means, its more or less a learning experience bot.",

We switched to treaded wheels in 2023 (we also switched to SDS MK4i COTS modules). While the Colson wheels were great, the higher CoF from treaded wheels was definitely an improvement in terms of pushing power and the ability to resist being pushed around by defenders. Plus, it also helps acceleration as it raises the traction limited force that can be applied. I would also say that our experience this year with the stock SDS treads was that they wore as well as the Colson wheels, maybe even better. We were replacing our Colson wheels after just about every event in 2022 due to wearing through the tread (down to the hard plastic core), but we did not do nearly as many wheel changes with the SDS treaded wheels and were replacing them mostly as a pro-active step rather than as a result of wear.\n\nWe carry a full set of 4 spare wheels (8 wheels total) fully built up with the bearings and ring gear so that we can swap out the wheel quickly if needed. Since the treads can be replaced, we can take the worn set and put new treads on for the next replacement. The cost of the treads ($10 each) is less than the cost of the Colson wheels ($15 each), so the consumable costs are lower with the treaded wheels.\n\nSo, I don’t think there is really any advantage in trying to use Colson wheels.",
