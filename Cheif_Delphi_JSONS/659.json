                    "cooked": "Hey everyone,\n\nHope you all had a fantastic 2025 competition season and congrats on a great competition year! Reflecting on this past season, one thing that really caught my eye was seeing Team 6328 running a Mac Mini M4 onboard for vision processing with pretty impressive results. This got me thinking – could this be a game-changer? The performance boost from Apple Silicon, even at low power consumption, is pretty compelling, potentially making it much easier to deploy larger ML models right on the robot.\n\nAs a long-time user of PhotonVision (huge props to the team, you guys rock!), I love how accessible it makes vision for students and the cool new features added each year. Seeing YOLO models running locally on Orange Pi last year for real-time game piece detection was awesome!\n\nWhile PhotonVision releases technically do support Intel/M-series Macs, it’s not quite plug-and-play yet. As the docs mention, WPILib’s cscore support for macOS camera handling is still a bit limited.\n\nSo, I thought, maybe it’s time to explore native macOS support for PhotonVision more seriously! I started tinkering to see what it would take to get PhotonVision running smoothly on macOS.\n\nMy journey began by addressing some of the cscore-macOS limitations:\n\nFixed various minor issues with USB camera connection and streaming on macOS.\n\nImplemented UVC protocol support within cscore-macOS, allowing control over USB camera properties like exposure, brightness, white balance, etc.\n\nWith those foundational bits in place, I created a new project called coreml_jni , inspired by the awesome rknn_jni :\n\nIt uses Apple’s native CoreML API to deploy and run inference for YOLOv5, YOLOv8, and even YOLOv11 models.\n\nIt provides a Java interface similar to rknn_jni .\n\nIncludes unit tests and Javadoc (definitately needed!).\n\nFinally, I integrated coreml_jni into PhotonVision itself:\n\nImplemented a NeuralNetwork Backend specifically for the CoreML platform.\n\nMirrored the relevant RKNN implementation details for CoreML.\n\nSuccessfully deployed and tested the YOLOv11 model fine-tuned by Team 6328 for Coral/Algae detection.\n\nEverything seems to be heading in the right direction! On my M1 MacBook Air, I’m seeing real-time Coral/Algae detection hitting close to 60 FPS.\n\nimage 2824×1770 495 KB\n\nimage 2824×1770 495 KB\n\nimage 2824×1770 495 KB\n\nOf course, I know this is just an initial experiment on macOS, and turning it into a fully validated and maintained feature is a bigger undertaking. That’s why I wanted to reach out and get your thoughts – especially from other teams and PhotonVision contributors. What’s your take on this? Any initial reactions or concerns?\n\nIf you’re curious about the code implementation, feel free to check out these links. Just a heads-up, I haven’t opened upstream pull requests yet, as I wanted to gauge community feedback first:\n\nFork of PhotonVision\n\nFork of allwpilib (cscore changes)\n\ncoreml_jni\n\nI also have a pre-compiled PhotonVision build that runs directly on macOS (though it’s still quite raw). If anyone’s interested in trying it out, I can attach it here.\n\nThanks for reading! Yuhao from Team 6766",

I noticed in some earlier tests that PyTorch and OpenCV perform noticeably better on my Hackintosh installation than it does on Windows or Linux. Because of that I’ve been thinking about incorporating PhotonVision into the pipeline to make some things easier for me.\n\nI’ll suggest changes as needed if it doesn’t work as expected on here, but hopefully I don’t have to go that route.",
