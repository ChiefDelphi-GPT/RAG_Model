Here’s another.\n\nWe are using a roborio 2.0, Trendnet E-50 Ethernet switch and an Orange Pi 5 with two cameras. On our practice field - we will get random robot disables during auto routines or during driving in teleop. When we are stationary doing something like shooter calibration we don’t experience the robot disables. Indication in logs when it does happen is usually the 44004 message. We’ve swapped out the Trendnet switch with our spare Trendnet, changed every Ethernet cable, went from a Pololu 12V regulator to rhe 12V 2A out of a VRM to power the Trendnet switch, updated every firmware, library, patch and reformatted everything that could be formatted and we still had the problem.\n\nYesterday we decided to connect the radio directly to the roborio (via the Rev RPM ) using the radio port 1 and then connecting the radio port 2 to the switch.\n\nProblem seemed to go away.\n\nSo?\n\nWhat could possibly have been going wrong with our original configuration where we had the switxh betwen the roborio and the radio POE port1?\n\nThere are tons of cautions about using that port 2 on the radio - but what’s the consensus on how we are using it now?\n\nThat Trendnet Ethernet switch has a metal case with a chassis ground connection that we don’t have connected - but we do have the chassis screws to our belly pan - red herring or something to think about?  Last year we had the switch on its side with double sided tape. EDIT - we just checked - the switch chassis is not isolated from the robot frame, so we I’ll be changing the mounting method.  Last year we set it on its side and used double sided tape.\n\nWhat sort of hint (if any) is provided by thre fact that the unexpected robot disable doesn’t happen when the robot isn’t being driven, even if it’s actively being fed notes and shooting?\n\nThanks!",

Software wise, the 2024 DS added control timeouts that weren’t present last year, so you might have had dropouts in previous years that simply went undetected.  Make sure you’re on the latest DS version (either 2024 Game Tools Patch 1 or 2). Known Issues — FIRST Robotics Competition documentation\n\nMany teams are seeing ESD and/or power supply noise issues this year, and Ethernet switches seem particularly susceptible.  If a switch has a metal chassis, it may or may not be legal to connect it to the robot chassis, depending on whether the metal chassis is isolated from the DC input ground.  It is not legal to have an electrical connection between DC (battery) ground and the robot chassis (this is checked during inspection).\n\nThe increase in ESD-related issues this year probably stems from a few different factors, including swerve drives with plastic or rubber (instead of metal spoked) wheels, high-speed spinning plastic/rubber shooter wheels between sheets of polycarb with no grounding path, etc.  Similarly, swerve drives create much more power supply noise than tank drives, so good power supply noise isolation/regulation is more important than ever.",

How does this apply to the 3 power leads to the brushless motors?\n\nA noise filter may be wired across motor leads or PWM leads. Such filters will not be considered CUSTOM CIRCUITS and violate neither this rule nor R712. Acceptable signal filters must be fully insulated and must be 1 of the following: − 1 microfarad (1 µF) or less, non-polarized, capacitor may be applied across the power leads of any motor on your ROBOT (as close to the actual motor leads as reasonably possible) or − a resistor may be used as a shunt load for the PWM control signal feeding a servo.",

The main power bus of the robot (e.g. the outputs of the PDH ) is extremely noisy due to motor loads.  Electronics (e.g. the low-voltage processing cores and high-speed signaling in switches, coprocessors, etc) are sensitive to noise.  The part in between (the power supplies / voltage regulators) play a critical part in not only operating through the voltage dips, but in filtering the noise so it doesn’t disrupt the operation of the sensitive electronics.",

If every time you power on your robot, you verify that your coprocessors are connected correctly and reboot the robot if they are not, then you should be pretty safe. However that leaves it up to chance if your coprocessors will still work after a reboot on the field. If loosing them mid match doesn’t affect you that much then using both ports does reduce failure points in the RIO connection.",

This is the first year that a significant number of teams have been reporting issues with that approach, probably due to some combination of ESD, swerve, and tighter DS timeouts.  So it has always been a risk tradeoff, but perhaps has shifted this year.",

And given we can’t seem to get the Ethernet switch to work reliably (at least not before this weekends event most likely) we are going with the port 2 approach. If it affects ability to process apriltags - so be it - at least we maintain comms between the radio and roborio.\n\nAnyway one could say there’s a risk/benefit trade off for using something like Photonvision to improve pose and shooting accuracy - and vision means coprocessors and limelight’s and need for Ethernet switching. And - game designers stuck a bunch of Apriltags around the field so we should be able to use them.\n\nLet’s hope the new radio addresses most or all of this as an alternative to a separate Ethernet switch",
