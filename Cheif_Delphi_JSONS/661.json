Recycling an old FRC materialso we have decided to use a 4-wheel mecanum drive base controlled by an older roboRIO 1. We are new to programming this type of drive system in LabVIEW and could use some guidance to help us get started.\n\nWe should  imaged the roboRIO we found ( Are we able to use a roborio 1 in 2025 FRC - #12 by Walleye ) and are now focusing on the LabVIEW code. We are looking for help understanding the basic code structure for controlling the mecanum wheels. Specifically, we’d like to learn how to:\n\nIndependently control the forward/backward movement of the device. Implement precise strafing (left/right) capabilities for maneuvering in tight spaces. Control the rotation of the device for accurate positioning. Effectively combine these movements based on user inputs, such as joystick axes. Given the sensitive nature of a Patient Transfer Device, smooth and controlled movement is crucial. We would greatly appreciate any example code snippets, explanations of the underlying logic (especially any considerations for smooth starts and stops), or pointers to relevant resources or best practices for this type of application. We are currently using [mention any specific hardware you are using, like motor controllers (e.g., Victor SPX, Talon SRX), and the type of motors if you know].\n\nThanks in advance for your time and expertise! We are very eager to learn and develop a reliable and safe patient transfer device.\" Any pointers to best practices relevant to this type of device, which might include safety considerations in the code.",

Should be interesting, and the hospital industry really needs a good prod to start using some hardware to assist nursing staff!  As far as I understand, Japan is FAR ahead of us…  Our nursing staff injury rates are just insane!\n\nSand bags and rolled carpets aren’t a crazy way to simulate a human.  Please simulate first…  And think very hard before you lift a human.  In the design world where we need to provide a safety anchor point for fall arrest, I think it was 5,000 pound rating for any direction.  BUT, its been a few years and I would look it up before designing that type of stuff again!  Note that the 5,000 pound rating builds in a significant fall distance and some energy absorbing in the fall arrest lanyard.  And a VERY healthy safety factor.\n\nPlease keep in mind that there are a LOT of things required for “medical devices” to be safe enough to work with humans, especially not-fully-functional humans!  Lots of ways to get in trouble…",
