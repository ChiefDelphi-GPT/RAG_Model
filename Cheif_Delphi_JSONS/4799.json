Usually, we used whatever big ¾” wood we had on hand, but this year, I want to use better wood. I was not sure if we should go with Baltic birch plywood like everyone recommends or if we should just use normal plywood. This year, we are going to two regionals as well as using a single bumper with an interchangeable fabric covering. What would be the best option for these given circumstances? Thanks! - M",

A second set will last longer, and swapping in pits isn’t too difficult with some of the mount designs available. I have not heard a convincing argument for the added complexity of reversible bumpers, especially when there is no longer a combined bumper weight.\n\nReconsider; regular ply with two bumpers will likely last longer than baltic birch with only one bumper.",

Reefscape should have a lot fewer high speed collisions than previous years so that should reduce the damage. If you don’t choose Baltic make sure you are getting a structural plywood not cabinet grade, and get as may layers as possible etc.\n\nphilso:\n\nLook for the plywood with the most layers, usually about 7 for 3/4\"\n\nLots of layers are one of the reasons people recomend Baltic birch. 18mm (3/4\") Baltic birch plywood must be 13ply, anything less and you are not buying Baltic birch. BS1088 also typically has 13 layers though it can vary by manufacturer.",

Find a solid wood available in your area that strikes a balance between strength, weight, and price.\n\nIf you are going to get something that is available at your typical hardware store, poplar would be a decent choice.    A 1x6 poplar board would meet specifications.  It is 3/4\" thick and 5.5\" tall.  You could remove 1\" from the height if desired.  Such a board is usually around $4 USD per foot.  So you might spend $100 in bumper wood for a pair of bumpers for a typical FRC bot.\n\nOther hardwoods are likely to be stronger, heavier, and more expensive. My local lumber yard stocks 1x6 boards in Red Oak, Poplar, Cherry, Maple, SY Pine, and Nat. Birch.  You can use the wood strength database to compare these.  For bumpers you would probably care about the MOR index (how easy it is to break the board.)\n\nWood MOR Strength Red Oak 35.4 Poplar 23.4 (yellow popular) Cherry 29.6 (black cherry) Maple 32.6 (red maple) Nat. Birch 41.6 (yellow birch)\n\nSo if you were willing to spend more and have heavier bumpers, birch looks like a reasonable choice.",

It is easy to make it split, especially when shock forces are applied to the brackets attached to the wood. Depending on the type of wood, driving screws into it without pre-drilling a hole of the proper size may make it split.\n\nIf you are going to use solid wood, poplar is a good choice. It is stronger than clear pine and not much more expensive. It is also easier to work with, less likely to split, and less expensive than commonly available hardwoods like oak.",

This is so much safer and easier than any kind of rotating saw, and for what amounts to a one-off afterthought project for a lot of teams, it’s the right level of unsophisticated.\n\nWith this, you can triangulate corners, or make brackets to fit the frame pretty much effortlessly.

Something our team learned over the past few years is that the support and fastening of the wood matters way more.\n\nFor example, interior corner brackets tend to bend overtime. Gaps between the chassis and wood backing can lead to damage upon impact. Small screws tend to pull out of most woods, Baltic birch and some others hold screws better but something going all the way through is likely the better option.\n\nOur team experienced pretty bad deterioration, then we updated our mounting, support, etc and have seen significant improvement, without changing our wood type.",

                    "cooked": "Howdy. This is a smart question, because you asked “given the circumstances”. Here’s my take on the circumstances.\n\nThis game is likely to have very few high speed collisions in the way the past two years did. This may have collision speeds more like 2022 or even slower, and you’re more likely to bounce off your alliance partners than either a ridid, narrow field object or an opponent.\n\nThe rules around bumper material have significantly relaxed. This includes not only backing material but also foam and cloth covers.\n\nIf you follow the advice given above mine, and use (for example) pine 1x6, you’re less likely to suffer debilitating damage to either your bumper or your robot than you would have been last year.\n\nHowever,\n\nThe advice to use solid wood is based on a series of factual errors. The first is historical. There was never a time when plywood was required and solid wood was not allowed . Solid wood has always been allowed but it’s never been recommended.\n\nThe second error is the belief that solid wood is superior to plywood for this purpose. Speaking as someone who has been a woodworker and a woodworking teacher for the better part of half a century, this is absolutely not true. Solid wood, regardless of species, has strength along the grain but is weak perpendicular to this. Solid wood splits. Some splits less easily (Poplar) and some more so (Pine). It’s also inconsistent, because each piece has its own characteristics from the individual tree and part of the tree it was cut from.\n\nPlywood reduces or eliminates these problems by taking taking multiple, thin sections of wood and turning them 90 degrees to each other multiple times. It is therefore more consistent in all directions, less prone to splitting, etc.\n\nBaltic Birch and marine grade plywood are the gold standards for making structural elements like bumper backing. That said, they are expensive and hard to get. If you’re shopping at a big box store, the best choice is “sheathing” plywood, with a reasonably smooth and knot-free surface. This year, the thickness of your bumper backing isn’t going to be regulated, so if you can’t find 3/4\" you’re not going to be in trouble, but thicker material is still a better choice than thinner. Worse choices than sheathing, from big box stores, in descending order are:\n\nTreated plywood, which is heavier, wetter, and made to reduce decomposition in damp environments.\n\nFinish grade plywood, with nice (but paper thin) wood on the surface. This costs a lot more and tends to flake apart unless cut very carefully with specialty sharp blades.\n\nOSB, which is likely to flake or split.\n\nParticle board, which has almost no tensile strength and will crumble.\n\nOther quick notes:\n\nFolks pointing out that 1x6 is cheap are right. If budget is super tight that’s about your least expensive option other than dumpster diving. Just being involved in a competition that costs $6000 to register for some events, however, makes me want to encourage you to carefully consider protecting your investment.\n\nWhether using solid wood or plywood, attach your hardware with bolts and nuts that pass through the wood, rather than relying on screws into the wood itself, which tends to loosen or pull out over time when subject to the kinds of hits you will see in FRC .\n\nGood luck, happy to help with any other questions about bumpers.\n\nMrN",

If anyone is looking for saw recommendations, you can’t go wrong with a ryoba hand saw (get the ones with replaceable blades), in my experience it’ll be faster than an oscillating saw, with a better cut quality and no electricity needed. And a miter saw can be beaten for fast square cuts.\n\nAs for using solid wood, it is much worse at holding fasteners than a plywood of a similar species, but if you can use glued joints or bolts to clamp a large area of wood between two metal plates, some woods should be fine. Pine will still want to split if it’s not supported by the robot’s frame in a heavy collision, and the stuff sold as trim often has lots of finger joints that can be very weak.\n\nI don’t think fully composite bumper backers would work very well, they’ll shatter if they’re much thinner than the wood would be, but they are much denser than wood.",

There was never a time when plywood was required and solid wood was not allowed . Solid wood has always been allowed but it’s never been recommended.\n\nBy way of history, there were early years where bumpers were optional (2005–2007), and starting in 2006, in exchange for having bumpers exempted from the overall size and/or weight, teams had to build a standard bumper design. That standard design required “plywood” to the absolute exclusion of all other forms of wood. Then from 2008, bumpers built to the standard design became mandatory, and plywood was therefore mandatory; this persisted from 2008–2012. In 2013, “solid, robust wood” became permissible. The definition of what was solid and/or robust was subject to interpretation, and various Q&As and inspectors have attempted to do so, differently in different years; sometimes the species or cut of wood was at issue.\n\nmrnoble:\n\nThe second error is the belief that solid wood is superior to plywood for this purpose.\n\nI agree that when people hold this belief, they are generally incorrect, in the sense that plywood is a superior product mechanically under almost all circumstances. I’m just saying that given the 2025 rules (both game and bumper), the margin of superiority isn’t what it used to be, and so if a team needs an easy way out, this could be it.\n\nI definitely wouldn’t want teams to invest heavily in traditional finish woodworking skills, only to hit the limits of the base material. Now that non-wood backings are allowed, and that bumper weight itself is not constrained, teams who want to go all-in maybe ought not to even be using a wood product.",

I’m just saying that if the original poster is building the bumpers themself, as they supposed, it stands to reason that their individual capabilities might matter a lot. It might make sense to choose materials and tools that are less efficient, but which require less capital cost, less risk cost, less training and less permission.",
