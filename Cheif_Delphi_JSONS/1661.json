                    "cooked": "What’s the best way to implement a go to pose command? We are trying to align to a reef branch using vision. Last year, we were able to get it mostly working but we are trying to now make it more accurate. Currently, we start our reef alignment with a pathplanner pathfinding command that targets the pose of the robot needed to score on a branch. Once we are within 2 m of our target translation, 10 degrees of our target rotation, and can see the apriltag on the target side of the reef, we switch to a profiled pid go to pose command.\n\nThis go to pose command uses 3 profiled pids (x, y, and theta). We are setting the speed of the drivetrain to the output of the pid plus the pid’s setpoint velocity. It looks something like this:\n\nWe’re running into an issue where our robot is constantly overshooting. The value/setpoint/goal plot of the pids look something like this:\n\nimage 713×556 20.6 KB\n\nimage 713×556 20.6 KB\n\nimage 713×556 20.6 KB\n\nThe robot initially lags behind the setpoint. Then, it passes the setpoint and overshoots. The velocities and accelerations of the profile seem reasonable in that the drivetrain should be able to reach it. The velocities and accelerations of the x and y pid profiles are both 3 m/s and 2 m/s^2 respectively. Our pose estimates (fused odometry + vision) seem to be pretty stable and accurate. We’ve also tuned our wheel radius with the “Drive Wheel Radius Characterization” routine in the AdvantageKit template and tuned our drive feedforward values with the “Drive Simple FF Characterization” routine. We’ve tried tuning the pids but changing the gains (raising and lowering kP and kD) doesn’t seem to fix our issue.\n\nI’d love to know how other teams are implementing their go to pose commands, or if you guys are using a completely different alignment strategy. Is there something we can do to improve our alignment?",
