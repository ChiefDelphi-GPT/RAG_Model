                    "cooked": "hey everybody (particularly @Oblarg , i think this is a question about your code),\n\nI’m working on a multi-level planner framework (to better integrate multiple student projects, and also for simulation), and I’m trying to figure out how to implement it using the command scheduler.  the general idea is for some sort of planner to select commands on the fly, e.g.:\n\nthe planner decides to run X.\n\ncommand X starts (this is actually a command sequence).\n\nwhile X is running, the planner decides to run Y (using a different subsystem).\n\ncommand Y starts.\n\ncommand X completes. the planner notices and decides (based on arbitrary input) to run Z.\n\ncommand Z starts.\n\nthe planner decides (based on arbitrary input) to cancel both Y and Z, and run X again.\n\ncommands Y and Z are interrupted.\n\ncommand X runs …\n\nis there a “canonical” way to implement this sort of planner with commands?   it seems straightforward enough to use CommandScheduler.schedule() and cancel(), but it’s not obvious how to trap the completion event.  I could use the Command.end() method to signal completion to the planner, but that would effectively be using end() to schedule new commands, which is discouraged in the comment describing end().  is there a technical reason for that comment (below)?\n\nI could add an action via onCommandFinish() that could filter every completion event, but that seems worse than using end().\n\nwdyt?\n\n/** The initial subroutine of a command. Called once when the command is initially scheduled. */\n\npublic void initialize() {}\n\n/** The main body of a command. Called repeatedly while the command is scheduled. */\n\npublic void execute() {}\n\n/**\n\n* The action to take when the command ends. Called when either the command finishes normally, or\n\n* when it interrupted/canceled.\n\n*\n\n* <p>Do not schedule commands here that share requirements with this command. Use {@link\n\n* #andThen(Command...)} instead.\n\n*\n\n* @param interrupted whether the command was interrupted/canceled\n\n*/\n\npublic void end(boolean interrupted) {}\n\n/**\n\n* Whether the command has finished. Once a command finishes, the scheduler will call its end()\n\n* method and un-schedule it.\n\n*",

Or you could use andThen to send your own notification to the planner.\n\nI’m sure that Oblarg will have a more exciting approach, which I look forward to reading.",

I’ll just also note that there’s also onCommandInterrupt() for the interrupt cases (Note to self: We should probably add onCommandEnd() ), but neither of those will work for composed commands (since the callbacks are handled by CommandScheduler , but compositions manage the commands themselves).\n\nA few other suggestions to consider:\n\nSince scheduling from end() is valid, you can wrap the command in onEnd() , which would be more in line with modern practices (subclassing and overriding methods yourself is discouraged).\n\nUsing andThen() with a DeferredCommand is a possible way to chain commands (I think it’d be a more declarative manner, but I’m not familiar with the terminology), though a naïve implementation would likely run into memory issues, since old commands would not be GC’d. (Note that if you need to follow the command with multiple other commands, you can use a parallel command group). bovlb’s suggestion of andThen(Commands.runOnce(() -> scheduleNextCommand())) would avoid the memory issues, though.",

We advise against manually calling schedule because it is error-prone.\n\nInstead of starting a command sequence, start a single command, and have the sequencing be implicit in a series of Trigger bindings that activate throughout the robot action.\n\nIf you need the end of a command to toggle a trigger, you can do so in the command’s finallyDo block.  Having a Trigger instead of just calling schedule directly also lets you name the trigger something semantically-meaningful (surely there’s a better way to refer to that inflection point in the sequence other than “the end of command X”).",
