                    "cooked": "Need some last-minute conversion support, please. The team has switched its wrist encoder to the REV through-bore hex encoder with 6pin cable attached directly to a Sparkmax. We are controlling a brushed HDHex Rev motor. Programming says they can find it and keep getting a sensor fault. Cables tested for continuity and swapped out. Multiple sparks swapped out. Encoder was swapped out. So I am wondering how this may be misconfigured in our understanding of the control pathway between all three.  Any help will let us get back to driving practice for districts- Thank you so much.

REV isn’t in the habit of putting non-working stuff in their guides.\n\nBrushed motor in a Spark Max: Make sure the Spark is in Brushed mode, leave the white wire disconnected when you connect the red and black wires.\n\nIf the sensor works with a Spark Max, it’ll work. NEO encoders are internal, CIMs don’t have their own internal so rely on through-bore and other encoders–which in this case are routed into the Spark Max. HDHex motors have internal encoders but those can work with a SparkMax.\n\nOn to the setup at hand.\n\nFirst question: Has the onboard sensor for the HDHex been disconnected? Second question: Does the Spark Max know that said sensor is disconnected? Third question: Is anything else connected to the motor or speed controller? 4th question: What do you mean by “Programming says they can find it and keep getting a sensor fault”?\n\nYou’ve swapped all the hardware and still have the issue. That leaves 2 options: 1, you have something that’s corrupting hardware. Possible, but unlikely. 2, your configuration is bad and your hardware is good. So, go through the programming setup that was previously posted. Set the motor to the right motor, the controller to the right type, and the sensor to the proper sensor. If it still doesn’t work, I’m out of ideas* but I’m sure someone else will have some.\n\n*Other than, “are you sure that motor is strong enough?”, but given that you’ve made it through two events and haven’t changed it I’m going to assume that it is.",
