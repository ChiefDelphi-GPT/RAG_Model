                    "cooked": "Hi all, Just wanted to make people aware of this. It seems like when you use a single stage max planetary with a kraken, the kraken’s output shaft is long enough that you cant assemble the gearbox without compressing the kraken shaft. We were being careless and forced the max planetary together and it killed the kraken. Rev has updated the docs on the kraken max coupler page since this happened.\n\nREV Robotics designs, builds and manufactures robotics parts and components used by students for learning about science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). Our parts are commonly used within the FIRST Robotics Competition and the FIRST Tech...\n\nPrice: USD 8\n\nSequence of events:\n\nWe installed brand new kraken into a single stage 3:1 maxplanetary\n\nRobot was powered on and the motor was spun with phoenix tuner. The motor stuttered and then stopped spinning\n\nintake was taken apart to look for something causing friction which would stall the motor. during that process we tried spinning the motor off the gearbox and saw that it wouldn’t spin.\n\nAt this point we assumed the kraken was bad and grabbed another one. Just to be sure this wasn’t a code issue, we spun the new motor with phoenix tuner before it was installed.\n\nMotor was installed into max plan. This time installed by a mentor, felt a little resistance when tightening it down, but didn’t think too much of it.\n\nonce motor was installed, tried to run it in phoenix tuner and motor did the same thing as before: stuttered and then stopped spinning.\n\nTook motor off and started inspecting the gearbox. This is when we realized the kraken shaft was touching the button head that holds in the output shaft\n\nWe measured the kraken shafts of the two motors that had been in the gearbox and a brand new one and realized that they were ~60 thou shorter. It seem like when you apply that much force to the kraken it kills something inside it.\n\nWhen you look at the kraken/max planetary assembly in cad you can see that when stacked up as intended there is some extra space between the motor and the gearbox image 900×859 168 KB\n\nimage 900×859 168 KB\n\nimage 900×859 168 KB\n\nWhat we had done is over tighten the screws that hold the base plate to the rest of the stages. This compressed the kraken shafts. You can see the conflict in the image below between the shaft and the screw. image 720×624 111 KB\n\nimage 720×624 111 KB\n\nimage 720×624 111 KB\n\nSolution: We made a 1/8\" plate that spaced out the motor from the gearbox. Something thinner like .090\" would probably be better as the difference in spacing is 0.0773\" but 1/8\" was what we had.\n\nimage 761×946 110 KB\n\nimage 761×946 110 KB\n\nimage 761×946 110 KB\n\nHere is a link to the onshape where I checked the spacing and made the spacer plate:\n\nSign in to Onshape, the #1 fastest growing CAD system in the world with over 4 million users.",
