The waste board has 450 holes drilled and countersinked with t-nuts on the back for clamping. We’ve had a couple issues with it: when we screw our stock down, the t-nuts tend to loosen and pull out over time, causing our board to raise and create uneven surfaces, and some of the holes we use to clamp strips and we can’t use them; we also don’t want to keep replacing the board (we have to every couple of years since we have to face the board to keep it flushed). This is our cutting process: we start by clamping the stock down with bolts and pieces of scrap metal. We drill in any holes (usually .196 or 5 mm), then we do the outside contours. In order to keep the piece from flying away, we drill bolts into those holes we’ve just cut. We also use tabs. We usually use aluminum sheets to cut bearing holes, gussets, bellypans, etc on our CNC, and the options I’ve found online doesn’t really work with these (the ones on Youtube are all for wood).\n\nHere’s a photo of how we clamp: Screen Shot 2024-07-24 at 3.31.56 PM 1606×1202 167 KB\n\nScreen Shot 2024-07-24 at 3.31.56 PM 1606×1202 167 KB\n\nScreen Shot 2024-07-24 at 3.31.56 PM 1606×1202 167 KB",

Set it all up like you have it now but with a thicker board lets you deck the surface flat again and also makes it stay more flat. You have a CRAZY AMOUNT of hold down screws, our Velox 4x4 only has maybe 12 bolts on it that we then glued more spoil board on top of for even more ability to machine it flat. I would also suggest directly mounting your vise jig to the table and not the wood.",

T-tracks do have the advantage of being a lot more reusable and you can really easily remove them. Plus, you’d be able to clamp to the table and said clamps should always work. I’d consider a hybrid with a waste board with T-track set below the board maybe .5in, however the biggest issue with something like that is you’d need to clean it of chips a lot since it’ll clog.",

A good vacuum is pretty expensive though so I wouldn’t necessarily recommend it. For our CNC Mill we use a 3/4\" plywood and wood screws and just plan to replace it semi - regularly. We’ve used up the spoil board from resurfacing faster than we fill it with screw holes. The plywood is cheap and holds screws quite well so I’d recommend.",

What do you think?\n\nI use expanded PVC foam at work, the big upside is you can use water based emulsion coolants with it and it won’t destroy your board. You can also get the stuff in inch thick easily but its a lot more expensive than MDF or particle board. I have never looked into HDPE, but I could see it working, just not sure how well it takes a screw without pulling up a burr.",

I use #6 x 3/4\" or #4 x 3/4\" flathead Phillips screws depending on hole size. You don’t need any hold down clamps this way, except to hold the MDF onto the CNC table. You can also use HDPE or another plastic if the MDF dust is a problem for you, though I recommend getting a dust boot or similar for facing it down to help with this on MDF.\n\nI usually stack 3 3/4\" or 1\" thick sheets on top of each other. This let’s me choke up on the spindle for better accuracy and makes it easy to swap them out. Also makes the stack more rigid so having only 6-8 clamps on the edges of the MDF is plenty for heavy cuts up to 2 cubic IPM.",

The t-slot bolt (1/4-20 with a flat head) goes in the slot, and has a wing nut on it. The other bolt is a threaded hole.
