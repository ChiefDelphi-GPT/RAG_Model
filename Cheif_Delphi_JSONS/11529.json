                    "cooked": "Hi, my team is having an issue right now where our robot is browning out while driving around. We tried testing the robot for several hours trying to find the root of the issue, but had no luck. The only somewhat working solution was setting a current limit in software for the drive motors at 40 amps, but even then we still had an occasional brownout. It’s odd we are getting these brownouts because our robot from last year used about the same drive base setup with about the same code.\n\nThings we tried checking:\n\nDifferent batteries (and confirmed they were charged with a battery beak)\n\nReplaced the main breaker\n\nChecked the resistance between the battery connection and the PDH\n\nRunning only 2 drive motors (Still had brownouts with only 2 NEOs!)\n\nI also noticed in the rev hardware client our Spark Maxes had Gate Driver sticky faults, but they did not persist after power cycling the robot.\n\nRobot Specs:\n\n4x NEOs (Drive Base)\n\n1x NEO (Arm, turned off for testing)\n\n1x Compressor (Turned off for testing)\n\n1x PDH\n\n1x Pigeon IMU\n\n1x RIO 2.0\n\n1x Radio with Rev POE injector\n\nLogs from the evening: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PTo3xOXasKPNWxjKOFRJqQXA2E59Dots/view?usp=share_link\n\nCurrent code:\n\nMain Robot Code 2023. Contribute to panthertech292/2023_r development by creating an account on GitHub.\n\nIf anyone has got any ideas or solutions, they are very much appreciated!",

Double check the bolted connections on the battery terminals and the main breaker. Also check the battery internal resistance (Rint on the battery beak). It should be below 0.020. Below 0.017 would be best. The higher the internal resistance and resistance in your power connections, the more the battery voltage will drop under load.",

You can find the voltage drop across your wires with oh Ohm’s Law V=IR,  so for 0.7 ohms, and lets say 6A of current, you would get a 4.2V drop just between the anderson and the PDP. So ignoring battery and all other resistance a 6A current, would drop the voltage the rio sees from 12V to 7.8V.\n\nWith a 0.07 ohm resistance, you could have 80A with a 5.6V drop, plus a bit more drop from the battery which would be in line with what you’re seeing brown-out wise.\n\nTo find the resistance, I assume you’re measuring the resistance between the positive contact on the anderson and the positive terminal on the PDP, and adding that to the resistance between the ground contact and terminal to get your 0.7 ohms total resistance?",

So, if you’re talking about a range value from (-1, 1), which you are because you’re using ArcadeDrive from WPILib, then a rate limiter instantiated with 3.0 will be from 0->Full in 1/3 of a second. For some reason it took me far longer than it should have to realize that was the implementation when we first started using them last year.\n\nThe nice thing about a SlewRateLimiter over the built-in ramp rates of the motor controllers we use is that you can limit things differently in the forward and reverse directions whereas the motor controllers we have apply the ramp rate in both directions.",

For example, the post on the battery which is held to the wire via a bolt/nut, this should not be able to rotate. If this connection can rotate, that means that it is not tight enough. Double check all of these connections - no connection should be able to “wiggle” at all (the main breaker, PDP/PDH, battery are all held down this way).\n\nWhat is the internal resistance of your batteries, and your robot weight? You said you have a battery beak, IR should be the bottom number on a battery beak. Unfortunately, the am14u toughbox default gear ratio changed this year to be pretty aggressive, which means for a robot of 120lb with a battery IR of .017, you will be browning out. Your battery IR should be as close to .013 as possible. We typically recycle batteries when they reach .020\n\nA slew rate limiter should not be necessary for a kitbot drive train to prevent brownouts. While this certainly could help, that’s not a solution to the problem, it’s a solution to the symptom of the problem.\n\nTo recap, check that all your connections from Battery → PDP are tight and do not wiggle. If the connector can turn/wiggle, that means that you are increasing your resistance in the wire.\n\nIf that’s not the problem, we’ll need to know the IR of your batteries, and the robot weight.",

We were having a similar issue at the beginning of the season, then we implemented the following current limits to resolve the issue :\n\nLooking at your log files, it seems that the brownouts happened during instances of 200A+ current draw through the battery, with each of the four drive motors almost drawing 80A each.  With our 8\" 6WD tank drive, I had to limit us to around 120A total to prevent brownouts. image 2996×1902 373 KB\n\nimage 2996×1902 373 KB\n\nimage 2996×1902 373 KB\n\nI’m curious what the distance is of your wire from the battery terminal, through the Anderson and main breaker, to the power distribution, then back to the battery terminal.  We had almost 8 feet of wire which we’ve now reduced to less than 3 feet, which helped a lot.  We also were using some older batteries (>20mOhm IR), and are purchasing some brand new MK batteries for competition.\n\nAs to gear ratios, we are using ~11:1 on 8\" wheels as well.",
