Now that the season has ended, I had some questions for the community.\n\nWhat other teams use ROS? Is your team interested in using ROS? If so why have you not/what is stopping you from switching to ROS?\n\nThis is just a general discussion amongst the first community as I am interested in seeing what everyone around the world thinks about ROS.\n\nAny and all input is really appreciate!\n\nEDIT: fixed wording/Format",

I was very lucky to have actually been able to attend the meeting and sit front row at that! It was truly a gift, and thank you for the link to the slides! There was a lot of information that I was not able to take notes on as I lacked the better judgement to bring a notebook unlike what seemed to be everyone else at the conference…\n\nMonjhall:\n\nPS, I’m almost always rooting for TJ^2. The kids have heard me saying many times that, “A win for TJ is a win for ROS.”\n\nAnd I really appreciate your support! I figure you’d also be happy to hear that my main intention with this thread is to get an idea of the communities desire/want for ROS as I hope to work on and create a “plug and play” type package for ROS to help expand it among FIRST .",
