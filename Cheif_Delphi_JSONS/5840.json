                    "cooked": "Hi I was working on a project and think I may have found a bug in Rotation2d, where values are incorrectly being wrapped into a 0-360 degree range. It also seems to apply for Rotation3d.\n\nThe Rotation2d class says “The angle is continuous, that is if a Rotation2d is constructed with 361 degrees, it will return 361 degrees. This allows algorithms that wouldn’t want to see a discontinuity in the rotations as it sweeps past from 360 to 0 on the second time around.”\n\nThis works when constructing a Rotation2d but fails for some of the math methods. The times method works as expected but the plus method wraps the sum value back to 0 - 360.\n\nIs this the intended result? I feel like it is not and the plus method is not supposed to wrap the value but I may be missing something.\n\nRotation3d also has  0 - 360 wrapping but it happens in all methods. Both the plus and times methods do the wrap, so it seems more intentional here.\n\nBelow is some code in which you can test this. I would expect that all of these print true but only the first one does.\n\nIs this the intended result of these functions? If not what is?",

Thus, no assumptions should be made about the Euler angle it returns later. Rotation3d already works like this, but Rotation2d special-cases it because 254’s version did it that way first. I’ve wanted to get rid of that behavior, but was told we couldn’t because it would break too much user code. In my opinion, if a user wants Euler angle behavior, they should just use an Euler angle ( double or Angle ) instead of Rotation2d.",

One of the main problems we encountered was when we tried to describe our drivetrains rotational velocity with Rotation2d. The drivetrain rotates at 640 deg/s and so if we try to add a rotational velocity to it in any way it effectively becomes rotating at 220 deg/s which is not what we want.\n\nThis becomes more apparent in Rotation3d because for look at the following code. In this case the moment you do rotationalVelocity.times(dt) your rotationalVelocity effectively becomes 220 degs/s.\n\nRotation3d rotationalVelocity = new Rotation3d(640, 0, 0); swerveRotation = swerveRotation.plus(rotationalVelocity.times(dt));",

There are an infinite number of Euler angles that can map to an individual SO(2) rotation, so the convention we adopted was to always* wrap the Euler angle we provide back to the user to remove this ambiguity.\n\nOn the RoboRIO’s potato-sized processor, we found value in letting Rotation2d act something as a union type, with the ability to store the Euler angle and/or the unit vector containing SO2 elements independently, and lazily computing (and caching) the missing fields upon asking for them: FRC-2023-Public/src/main/java/com/team254/lib/geometry/Rotation2d.java at main · Team254/FRC-2023-Public · GitHub\n\nBut conceptually, we want it to be as if “getRadians()” was always computed anew from the SO(2) rotation and so adopted a canonical wrapping scheme. If you want to do math on Euler angles without adopting SO(2) semantics, then you should use doubles or a first class Angle type. * as a (very small and likely premature) performance optimization we did allow construction without enforcing wrapping as a deliberate breach of this contract only because in many cases the caller trivially knows they aren’t wrapped, or knows that whatever math they are doing later won’t care.",

The link chain leads to Wikipedia.\n\nUnit quaternions, known as versors, provide a convenient mathematical notation for representing spatial orientations and rotations of elements in three dimensional space. Specifically, they encode information about an axis-angle rotation about an arbitrary axis. Rotation and orientation quaternions have applications in computer graphics, computer vision, robotics, navigation, molecular dynamics, flight dynamics, orbital mechanics of satellites, and crystallographic texture analysis.[5 When used t...",
