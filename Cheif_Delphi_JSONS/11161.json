For example, aluminum is a popular material for FRC robots due to its strength-to-weight ratio, while carbon fiber is a lightweight and stiff option for certain applications. It’s important to select materials that are appropriate for the specific needs of the robot and can be effectively manufactured with the available resources.\n\nManufacturing processes: The manufacturing process for a robot part can also impact its quality and performance. CNC machining is a popular and precise method for creating complex parts from a wide range of materials, but it can also be time-consuming and expensive. Other options such as laser cutting, waterjet cutting, and 3D printing may be more suitable for simpler parts or prototypes. Our team actually utilizes both CNC machining for large scale intricate parts while some of our smaller items are nylonx 3d printed.\n\nIn my opinion our most valuable machines in our team’s arsenal are:\n\nCNC Machine - Is able to machine our precise parts that fit motors and bearings.\n\nHorizontal Lathe\n\n3D Printers (We have 5 of them.)\n\nDrill Press\n\nLaser Engraver (Wood and other fun projects)",

Other options such as laser cutting, waterjet cutting, and 3D printing\n\nAll of the options you mention here fall under the umbrella of CNC machines. CNC stands for Computer Numeric Control and simply means that the machine is controlled by a computer rather than manually turning handles. Mills, lathes, sheet metal brakes, even drill presses can be CNC or manual machines. When you say that your “CNC machine” is the most valuable tool in your team’s arsenal, I assume based on context you actually mean a CNC router, or maybe a CNC mill.",
