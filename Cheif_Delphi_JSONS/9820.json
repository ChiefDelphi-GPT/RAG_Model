We have done our post action diagnostics and made an interesting discovery that we wanted to pass along.\n\nSince we were doing an off-season swerve build, we put together a robot with a mixed control system.  Our robot used a CTRE power distribution panel (PDP) and a REV Radio power module (RPM).  The REV RPM was powered directly by the CTRE PDP VRM connection (as if we were using the REV PDH). This does not work reliably. In order to use the REV RPM with the CTRE PDP, you MUST add the CTRE Voltage regulator module (VRM).  We haven’t seen any “mixed setup” wiring diagrams, so we wanted to document this for others.\n\nSince an all REV setup works without a VRM, this must mean that the REV PDH must have an internal voltage regulator for the side port(s) (circuits 20-23). Unfortunately, we had assumed the REV RPM had this circuitry. I didn’t find this in the REV documentation documentation anywhere, perhaps REV can confirm this for us.\n\nAnyway, I’m posting this here so that others can learn from our experience.",

In order to use the REV RPM with the CTRE PDP , you MUST add the CTRE Voltage regulator module ( VRM ).\n\nThis is false; something else was likely the culprit. To my understanding, adding a VRM in between the PDP and RPM is a violation of R616/R617 and is therefore not a legal setup. The way you originally had it wired is correct and the only legal way to do it.\n\nThere’s a few things that could’ve caused this behavior (though it’d help if you described it further):\n\n-The fuse for the VRM port is loose or worn, causing an intermittent connection that you didn’t properly recreate in testing. -Your RPM is faulty. As a CSA , I assisted one team whose RPM output would become insufficient if the input voltage dipped too low, despite still being in operating spec.\n\nmandrews281:\n\nSince an all REV setup works without a VRM , this must mean that the REV PDH must have an internal voltage regulator for the side port(s) (circuits 20-23).\n\nThey do not. There’s no voltage regulation on any port on either the PDH or PDP ; they’re identical in that regard.\n\nmandrews281:\n\nUnfortunately, we had assumed the REV RPM had this circuitry.\n\nIt does. It’s an 18V boost converter, that’s its primary function. Its operating range is 4.75V-18V; if that doesn’t match your experience, then there was an issue somewhere.",

The 30 sec was approximate; but had the time of a radio reboot.\n\nGiven the feedback here, I now suspect a faulty RPM (good suggestion @thatnameistaken ).  I could go through the various things we’ve tried; but the common thread is the RPM and a weaker main battery (yes, we’ve swapped radios, ethernet cables, wiggled power connectors, etc.).  By the end of SCRIW, simply raising our arm would trigger it the communication failure (we didn’t bring a full battery compliment, so the batteries got weaker at the day went on and the comms issue got worse).  We reproduced the issue at our shop with the same conditions, and (improperly I guess) inserting the VRM before the RPM could keep the communications up.\n\nIf the RPM has a voltage regulator, then either it’s much more sensitive to brown outs or it’s bad.",

We reproduced the issue at our shop with the same conditions, and (improperly I guess) inserting the VRM before the RPM could keep the communications up.\n\nThat sounds like a faulty RPM to me. It’s supposed to operate down to 4.75V; for reference, the roboRIO disables motor outputs at 6.3V, and the roboRIO 2.0 has a default brownout of 6.75V. It’s unlikely to sink down to 4.75V from there, and the RIO itself isn’t guaranteed to stay on below 4.5V.\n\nThe team I assisted at an event was seeing similar issues, and  could reliably reproduce it by aggressively driving back and forth on the practice field. The LED on the RPM would visibly go out briefly too. After swapping the RPM for a fresh one, everything worked as expected.\n\nFor clarity, there’s nothing improper from an electrical perspective about inserting the VRM (other than the efficiency loss compared to using just a VRM or (functional) RPM ), and it makes sense that it resolved the issue; it’s just against the rules because the radio power path is heavily regulated to ensure there’s no extraneous loads or failure points in it.\n\nmandrews281:\n\nIf the RPM has a voltage regulator, then either it’s much more sensitive to brown outs or it’s bad.\n\nThe RPM implicitly has a voltage regulator; it outputs 18V, which is higher than what it’s taking in. Its listed operating input voltage is 4.75V-18V.\n\nIt sounds like you’re seeing it drop out much higher than 4.75V. I’d recommend contacting REV support ; I’m sure they’d appreciate the opportunity to look into this.\n\n@Greg_Needel , has REV ever seen this behavior from an RPM ? I love the product, but I am intrigued by this being the second instance of this issue I’m aware of.",
