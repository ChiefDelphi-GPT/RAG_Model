We are a 3rd-year team in a rural community and are finally getting our footing in FIRST. We have the funds to support swerve and many of my team members are convinced swerve is the only way to go. I feel that we will not have enough time to figure swerve out before our season. Even if we were to get swerve running I’m not sure if it would be a worthy investment. So I guess my real question is, how difficult is swerve to set up? We have a skilled software engineer at our disposal but I don’t want to lean too heavily into our mentors. Is swerve worth it? or should we wait until we have more time to nail it down?",

My main takeaway remains that “Successful teams are that way primarily because of their organization and structure. That defines their training, their leadership, their planning, their mentors, their resources.” If those pieces aren’t strong I’d focus on those first.\n\nRegional matches are won on speed. A tank bot with a simple mechanism that is done early with lots of drive practice is far better than a swerve bot done late with a marginal mechanism.\n\nThis seems very late to start swerve. A strong software mentor helps a ton. Definitely taking a lot of risk to start now.\n\nThe strongest vote for swerve is the excitement it brings the students. I feel its a distraction for many mid-ranking teams but the boost in enthusiasm does have real value to it.\n\nSwerve is a distraction Technical Discussion",

If you choose to go this way, you need a lot of programming time, and a big enough team that a person or two can spend a lot of time working on swerve. You also need a simple enough robot that you are done with extra time to spare to work on swerve. We felt like the ceiling of swerve is much higher than the ceiling of a tank drive so we wanted to go for it and constantly keep updating it rather than sticking with tank, especially because of the very open field and the need for precise horizontal accuracy.\n\nTLDR: It can be done, but you need to invest in it with time and money. Look at the game to see if it’s even worth it.",

Programming is more difficult but I have been trying to lower that floor with my library YAGSL. If you are able to make your own subsystems that use DifferentialDrive you should be able to create a SwerveDrive object which acts similar to the former. There are ALOT of configurations you have to do for swerve and it is very important you understand all of them!\n\nIn short- yes you can still do swerve but don’t set your expectations too high unless you’re able to meet as if it were build season for the next month with a programmable bot built and wired correctly by next week. It may be more fun to do but you might just be better off with pathplanner + differential drive.",

Just because a team chooses to run swerve does not mean that some other part of their robot will suffer. And for that matter, swerve allows you to build simpler mechanisms due to to using swerve as alignment and caring less about passthrough vs sameside and is significantly easier to learn to drive than 6wd, meaning that a swerve driver with an equal or even less practice time than a 6wd bot will be a better driver on field.",

Pretty much where we needed to build an intake that could grab the game piece the moment it touches it, and during the offseason we did that, so in august we started on our own swerve drive. This ideology has helped our entire team understand the importance of moving game pieces rather than running around the field, pushing cubes around rather than picking it up.\n\nSaying that i think your teams best action moving forward is to focus a lot more on intakes and intakes designs. having a really good intake would make you a better team, better than having swerve and an okay/not great intake.",

                    "cooked": "We built our first custom swerve drive in 2016 as a learning experiment. Our first FRC -style full robot with swerve (Thrifty Swerve modules, in fact) was built in the winter of 2020, during Covid, and was used for training and practice. We chose not to use swerve in 2022 and did pretty well with just a standard WCD tank setup. We purchased several sets of modules in the weeks after the 2022 game ended, and spent our summer and fall building and programming robots that used the SDS MK4i modules. We used this exact setup on our 2023 competition robot and did well again. So there’s my personal journey with swerve, lasting at this point nearly a decade before we used it in competition. Hopefully this helps in understanding my answers to your questions.\n\nTilr:\n\nhow difficult is swerve to set up?\n\nMechanically it’s as easy as most tank drive designs these days, especially if you use the REV, SDS or WCP modules. All three are easy to assemble and only require four box tubes and a pan to be a drive base. That doesn’t mean it won’t take work or that you won’t make mistakes.\n\nTilr:\n\nI don’t want to lean too heavily into our mentors\n\nI admire this. I think my coding mentors and students are quite skilled this year and we have a slew of them, but even with our prior code they still run into difficulties on our off-season robots that they’ve built this fall. I wouldn’t want the pinch point of your team’s ability to play to be one coding mentor.\n\nTilr:\n\nIs swerve worth it?\n\nMaybe. I don’t know more about your situation than this post and the videos of your 2023 matches. My opinion and recommendation is that you do not take the leap this year, and instead focus on mechanisms and especially driver experience and practice. Build the KOP and drive it for a month before you compete, try to give your drivers realistic challenges with the joystick, and you will be more likely to be picked than you would be if you have swerve modules and no driver experience.\n\nTilr:\n\nshould we wait until we have more time to nail it down?\n\nI would say yes, but whatever you choose I wish you the best of luck.\n\nMr. N",

You can save a few $ and spend that debugging time that will inevitably partially happen during the season instead making your mechanisms really good.",

We thought we had a working swerve going into that first season, but we learned so much during the season that if you compare our swerve season 1 to our swerve season 2, there’s just no comparison in how they performed.\n\nA lot of that has changed.  If you go with CTRE controls, they will quite literally write the drive software for you in Java.  If you go non-CTRE, there are a number of libraries that are pre-written for you to draw from.\n\nKeep in mind that just being able to write a drivetrain for swerve is one thing.  Your drivers will need practice, and you’ll also need to develop a working Auto system.\n\nIf you haven’t started all these things already, it’s unlikely you’ll be successful doing it between now and your first competition unless you have experienced outside help.",

If you do want to pursue swerve for this year, here’s my suggestion: Once you figure out your dimensions, build a KoP chassis to those dimensions, and build your robot on top of that, reserving ports on your PDP/PDH for the steering motors.  Then, you can begin drive practice quickly, and improve your manipulators.  Then, if swerve gets better than skid steer more than about a week before competition, decide whether to move it over.  (Or build two robots like many teams did before bag and tag went away.)",

                    "cooked": "After using Swerve for a couple of years now, I would STRONGLY recommend waiting until next season, in my personal opinion.\n\nWe built our first Swerve drive in late 2020/early 2021 and spent basically an entire year, and hundreds of hours fine tuning it. In spite of that, when we built our 2022 robot as a swerve robot and took it to a week 0 competition to try it out, it did not drive, at all, that entire day. I would consider our team to be (both when we started swerve and today) fairly competent in both mechanical/electrical and programming areas, and we struggled to get it working to an acceptable level even with a whole year of practice, and still strive to improve it to this day, two seasons and three robots later. I’ve heard almost identical feedback from virtually every experienced team we spoke to about switching over to swerve as well.\n\nI will grant you, swerve has become significantly easier to get into in the past few years than it was when we started (both with lots of COTS module options and programming resources), but it’s still not something for the faint of heart to jump into without preparation.\n\nThat all being said, assuming FIRST doesn’t make any significant changes to how games are designed/played, Swerve is pretty clearly the future of FRC and should be pursued for teams with the resources for it, as a long-term project if nothing else. If you insist on building one this year, GeeTwo ’s comment above is probably the best option. Build a simple tank chassis and design the rest of your robot on top of it, and then, if you have the resources, build an interchangeable swerve chassis along side it. If you can get it working, swap the chassis over and you’re good to go, if not, you’ve got a decent working tank bot to compete with and a practice chassis for the off-season.",

Doing swerve is a great learning experience, even if you don’t get it working well it will be a great foundation for next year. We did out first swerve during the covid season and never really got it working well but that laid the foundation for a district championship the next season.\n\nThe good thing about swerve is with todays available solutions you can get a swerve chassis up and running in a week giving your programmers the rest of the season to  make it work while you continue to work on your scoring mechanisms.",
