We were driving with a new laptop and the Driver Station program frequently refused to connect even though the bot was up, code was running, and programs like Elastic were able to connect by direct IP. However, the issue was intermittent, and it would always eventually connect, so we didn’t think much of it.\n\nUnfortunately this caused repeated delays on the field, as every time we put it out there, the same delay happened. We luckily never missed a match because of it, but we could have. Because the issue appeared to be resolved after a manual RIO reboot on the field, the FTA told us it was likely a problem with our code, but our logs later proved otherwise.\n\nUltimately the problem turned out to be McAfee Total Protection, and in particular its Advanced Firewall. As far as I can tell, this product hooks into DNS resolution and checks domains against some cloud database of theirs. In an environment like FRC , where our computer is not connected to the internet, it seems like it simply hangs all DNS resolution and then just times out after a few minutes (an absurdly long time) and allows the connection. This means that connections via mDNS can be arbitrarily delayed, but connections to the static IP are fine.\n\nAnyway, this is yet another reason to purge McAfee from any computer you see.",
