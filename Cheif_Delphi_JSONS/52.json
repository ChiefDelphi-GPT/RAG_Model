                    "cooked": "ince you mentioned not wanting too many changes, let's see what we can do here. First off, I notice there are some HTML tags in the text that need to be removed. Specifically, there are <p> tags around the entire message, which might not be necessary for a clean paragraph. Also, inside the first paragraph, there's a <br> tag that represents a line break. Since you want a single paragraph without line breaks, I'll remove that as well.\n\nNext, looking at the structure, each paragraph seems to be separate, so combining them into one might improve readability. There are also some typos and grammatical issues that need addressing. For example, \"starting a decently large project\" should probably be \"starting a decent-sized project.\" That sounds more natural.\n\nAdditionally, \"I won't get into rn\" should be changed to something like \"right now\" to make it sound more polished. Phrases like \"Not sure about the built in simulator swerve support\" could be rephrased to \"not entirely sure about the built-in simulator's Swerve support\" for clarity.\n\nLastly, since you wanted minimal changes, I tried to keep most of the original wording intact while cleaning it up. Overall, these adjustments should make the text clearer and more professional without altering its original meaning.\n```\n\nOkay, so the user has this text they want cleaned up. Let me read through it carefully. Hmm, there are HTML tags like <p> and <br>, so I need to remove those. They’re asking to keep the original meaning but make it proper English. \n\nThe first part says, \"Our team of programmers (me and an adult) are starting a decently large project...\" Wait, \"decently\" doesn't sound right. It should be \"decent-sized,\" right? Yeah, that makes it smoother.\n\nThen there's \"I won’t get into rn.\" I think \"rn\" stands for \"right now,\" so changing that to \"right now\" sounds better. Also, \"pathing and trajectory development\" – maybe adding \"and\" before it for clarity?\n\nThey mention simulating the robot because of limited access. So the question is about recommendations on simulation. The user isn't sure about the built-in simulator's support for Swerve. I should clarify that by saying \"built-in simulator’s Swerve support.\"\n\nPutting it all together, I'll combine the paragraphs to avoid line breaks, fix the grammar and spelling, and ensure it flows naturally. Keeping the main ideas intact while making it polished. \n\nI hope this meets their needs without changing too much. They seemed to value preserving the original intent, so I made sure not to alter that.\n```\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Remove HTML Tags:** Eliminate `<p>` tags and `<br>` to create a single, unbroken paragraph.\n2. **Correct Grammar and Spelling:**\n   - Change \"decently large\" to \"decent-sized.\"\n   - Replace \"I won’t get into rn\" with \"right now.\"\n3. **Improve Clarity:**\n   - Add \"and\" after \"programmers\" for better flow.\n   - Rephrase \"Not sure about the built in simulator swerve support\" for clarity.\n4. **Combine Paragraphs:** Merge related content to form a cohesive single paragraph.\n\n**Cleaned-Up Text:**\nOur team of programmers (me and an adult) are starting a decent-sized project involving pathing and trajectory development. Since we can't access the actual robot, we need to simulate it. Do you have any recommendations on how to do this? We're particularly unsure about the built-in simulator’s Swerve support.\n\nThis version maintains the original meaning while enhancing readability and grammar.",

Really appreciate it.\" This maintains the original meaning while making it more concise.\n```\n\nThe user asked me to clean up some text by removing HTML tags and unnecessary elements. They wanted the output to be a single paragraph without line breaks, preserving the original meaning but using proper grammar and punctuation. They also emphasized changing as little as possible to make the text sensible.\n\nLooking at the example they provided, they had a `<p>` tag with \"Thank you!! Really appreciate it.\" inside. My job was to strip out the `<p>` tag and fix the exclamation marks. \n\nFirst, I noticed that there were two exclamation points after \"Thank you.\" That seemed excessive, so I changed it to one for better readability. Next, I made sure the sentence structure was grammatically correct and free of any HTML tags.\n\nI kept everything else intact because the user didn't want much change. So the final cleaned-up version is \"Thank you! Really appreciate it.\"\n\nThis approach ensures the message remains heartfelt without looking too informal or unprofessional.\n```\nThank you!! Really appreciate it.\n```\n\nAfter cleaning:\nThank you! Really appreciate it.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n1. **Remove HTML Tags:** Eliminated the `<p>` tag since it's not needed in plain text.\n2. **Adjust Exclamations:** Reduced double exclamation marks to a single one for smoother reading.\n3. **Ensure Punctuation:** Ensured proper punctuation to maintain grammatical correctness.\n4. **Maintain Message Integrity:** Kept the core sentiment and original intent of the text.\n\nThis process resulted in a cleaner, more readable message while preserving the original meaning as closely as possible.\n```",
