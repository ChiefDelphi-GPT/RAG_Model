                    "cooked": "Hello everyone! I’m trying to figure out what the small magnetic pins would do inside of a Koganei HEA series solenoid. It seems that these demagnetize over time and cause older solenoids to exhibit issues when undergoing high-frequency cycling. If I’m understanding the operation correctly, these pins simply act to transfer force from the armature up to the piston that activates the pilot valve - so why would they need to be magnetized?\n\nHere’s a link to the Koganei site:\n\n10mm width valve series providing reliable directional control of cylinders up to 25mm bore while consuming as little as 0.15watt power consumption. The Selection Guide provides a summary of the 54 di…\n\nAnd a (unfortunately unlabeled) diagram of the solenoid:\n\nIf anyone could assist with locating documentation that would explain these small magnetic pins, that would be helpful as well. I’ve looked for the patent, but can’t locate it.\n\nSince the solenoids are about $80 each, I’d like to be able to refresh my old ones instead of simply purchasing new. Any help would be much appreciated.",

                    "cooked": "Thanks for your responses!\n\nI have purchased some of these new from the manufacturer within the last year, and the interlock pins are certainly magnetized new, and lose it over time. Swapping the interlock pins seems to give new life to an old solenoid (dwell time for a cycle reduced significantly). Swapping the spools didn’t seem to make a difference.\n\nAfter reading through the patent last night, I came to a similar conclusion that the magnetization is somewhat irrelevant. However, on a solenoid that has been cycled hundreds of thousands of times, it’s likely that the conical springs are worn out. But on the downswing of the armature of the solenoid, if those interlock pins are still strongly magnetized, they assist in closing the flapper valve by an attraction to the spring behind the flapper. As the interlock pins lose magnetization, they no longer assist in this action, and the flapper valve relies only on a tired, old conical spring to close it.\n\nThat’s the only way that I could reason that swapping the interlock pins between a new solenoid and an old solenoid seems to give it some new life - but my guess is replacing the springs would have a far greater impact.\n\nRegarding the demagnetization; anyone have tips for magnetizing some very tiny parts?",
