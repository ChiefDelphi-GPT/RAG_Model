The issue always seemingly occurs right around scheduling/cancelling commands dealing with our intake subsystem (although I haven’t been able to prove its origin). I can share that code if it helps. The closest I found to others encountering this issue was some commentary on a WPILIB PR last summer that mentioned wacky behavior when scheduling another command at the end of a command, which IS something we do, so if that’s undefined behavior we can try something else.\n\nHoping to see if anyone has thoughts: any ideas welcome and thanks!",
