                    "cooked": "We have been having problems with our radio the past few weeks. It was working perfectly fine up to competition and during competition, but when we tried to test it after competition, the WiFi no longer worked. An ethernet connection still works, but we cannot connect wireless at all.\n\nDIP switch 3 (2.4 GHz) has always been on, except at competition. We currently do not have the proper materials to use the radio in Access Point Mode. Whenever we turn on the robot, the power light is on, after booting the SYS light flashes at 20 Hz, and the RIO light is on but blinks randomly. The blinking was seen before competition though. We have seen a small green glow from the 6 GHz light, but is very light and I assume the light is just leaking from the RIO light as it also flashes with it. So, neither the 2.4 GHz nor the 6 GHz light ever turn on. The radio is powered from the 12V port and PoE, which are plugged into the 12V/2A ports on the VRM .\n\nWe have tried swapping out the radio with another VH-109 and it has worked. We have tried different configurations for power and ethernet connections on the radio such as just ethernet and 12V or only PoE, and none of them have worked. We have reconfigured the radio and re uploaded the firmware multiple times already. We somehow got it working once, but the next day it stopped working. It has been over a week since it has worked.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nCorrection: The 6 GHz light does actually turn on during startup. It disappears when SYS light starts blinking though.\n\nEdit: We fixed it. I believe it was the ethernet cable as I tried configuring it with a different ethernet cable and it started working after. We also re-flipped the DIP switch and power cycled the robot afterwards.",
