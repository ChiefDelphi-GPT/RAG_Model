                    "cooked": "I’m not even too sure where to begin with this post. I suppose I’ll cut straight to the chase, our teams robot literally fried my computer. I’m kind of in a pickle with this situation\n\nBy fried too, I mean it literally won’t turn on and the funny white smoke came out from the USB port.\n\nOur team is currently migrating from tank drive to swerve ( Post here for more on that ) and we just got into wiring our robot this week. We got to the part where we were connecting our radio and we were following the diagram where it showed we didn’t need to use our VRM and could just power it straight to our REV PDH .\n\nI had to update our robot’s radio since it was still on competition firmware so we could communicate, so I plugged our ethernet adapter into my laptop, and the ethernet cable into the Driver Station Port on our radio. I’m aware the RIO Port is PoE compatible, but we definitely didn’t plug it into that. The rio port was occupied by the actual rio’s ethernet cable. The aux switches were all disabled too so no PoE could happen even if I accidentally plugged it into an aux port. Right after I did that, my computer instantly turned off, made a sizzling noise, and we had the white smoke. I unplugged it immediately but of course the damage was already done.\n\nAfter taking a closer look and taking the case off my laptop, it melted the USB port completely. The siding is also caved in from what I’m assuming to be heat? It’s not straight but looks melted. The motherboard that controls my USB port also had damage and had some brown/black marks on it, very small and hard to see but definitely existed.\n\nI do have to sprinkle in a little good news though, I was able to take my SSD out of my fried laptop and retrieve my files onto a hard drive - but the SSD was in good shape which I was happy about. I was worried I’d lose everything.\n\nThe radio was only powered by positive/negative wires to the PDH REV Board, so I’m insanely lost as to how this could have even happened.\n\nWhat makes this worse is that our school gave us a computer a year ago however it was a hand-me-down from a very out of date computer and wasn’t able to run the driver station. I’m the teams only programmer right now and I was using my own personal computer, so I’m officially out of a laptop. This sucks for me because I either have to find a way to repair it or get a new laptop. Classes begin soon too, so I need to think of a solution fast. I’m very aware that I shouldn’t have been using my personal laptop for FRC , but our team really didn’t have any choice in this matter right now. After talking it over with coaches, we’re going to go get an actual decent laptop with some funds we have left from our swerve fundraising. Sucks it had to be decided after I fried my laptop though.\n\nReason I’m making this thread: I don’t want a repeat of this EVER. What could have caused this, and how can I prevent this in the future? Do you guys think my laptop is repairable or would the symptoms it’s giving mean it’s most likely dead? When I plug it in, the light still shines on the laptop it just literally won’t turn on.\n\nIt’s just strange because we’ve done this exact same thing before to communicate to our robot from our radio and we’ve never had this issue before. The radio has been insanely reliable up until today.\n\nThanks for listening to my strange situation, I’ll be on to respond to comments and get advice.",

I’d also contact WCP as well, just in case if the radio is the problem.\n\nI agree with @four ’s suggestion about posting motherboard pictures, and doing basic troubleshooting, as your laptop might be fixable. Also, please tell us your laptop brand and model as well, as our team uses personal laptops for everything and has no problems.\n\nYou also should report this to the product safety authority in your country, to prevent further incidents.",

It had a 1650Ti in it with 24GB of RAM as well.\n\nI agree with adding a PoE blocker just for the future so that we don’t have a repeat of this, I’ll definitely talk with my coach as this will be a must going forward. I’ll post pictures of the motherboard in a bit, and the fans don’t spin. The power button doesn’t do anything. The CMOS battery I disconnected and reconnected but was unable to get anything working. I also disconnected the battery and tried to power it on from just power source but had no luck.\n\nThe USBC isn’t working either as I tried to connected it to a display and charging connector that our school has and it didn’t do anything.\n\nI like what Another_Person1 said about complaining to the ethernet adapter company because I believe their product may have caused this. I don’t know the exact model and I’ll tell you once I get to our shop later today, but our school provided us with that ethernet adapter and it hasn’t been too reliable with a few glitches here and there such as disconnecting and reconnecting.\n\nI don’t think this needs to be reported to the product safety authorities because I just don’t have an exact idea on how to pinpoint this down as to what happened. The thing I’d have to guess is somehow power went upstream like it was being PoE’d however it wasn’t.",

The VH-109 does have a metal housing, so I would think it could be possible that a short occurred, thus carrying voltage down one of the non-PoE wires of the Ethernet cable.\n\nJust for good measure, assuming you haven’t changed anything else on the robot yet, I might suggest taking a multimeter and doing some continuity checks.\n\nAside from that, what other people are saying about the USB-Ethernet adapter being the cause seems likely.\n\nAs far as the computer goes (I’m guessing from the specs you have a 2020 Dell Vostro 7500), from my time working in IT with Dell laptops, based on what you’ve said about it’s post-incident behavior, it’s likely your motherboard is dead (short of professional reflow repair), you probably popped a fuse somewhere (if properly isolated, sometimes just the USB bus will die, but they may not have done that on this model), especially if you don’t get a charge light when the power is connected. That said, I have also seen issues with the Dell chargers themselves shorting, so maybe try another Dell barrel charger if you have one (the USB-C is unlikely to work if the USB bus is fried).\n\nFor what it’s worth, the data on the SSD is probably recoverable if you remove the drive and connect it to another system (if it matters to you).",

The thing I’d have to guess is somehow power went upstream like it was being PoE’d however it wasn’t.\n\nYou should report it, as I agree with both @CarlosGJ and @cbale2000 that the (most likely non-compliant) usb ethernet adapter is most likely the cause. I also feel like the usb-if set safety standards as well as 802.3, as @CarlosGJ mentioned, to prevent situations like this from happening, but someone correct me if I’m wrong as I don’t have thousands of dollars to pay for a license and a copy of the USB standards. According to the vividhosting website, the radio only provides POE passthrough to the AUX 1 & AUX 2 ports.\n\nMaybe also take a few clear pictures of the ethernet adapter as well, cause sometimes adapters get rebranded and sold under other brands, but with the same underlying hardware.",

I still get a charge light when I plug the laptop in. When I opened the laptop up, the corner where the USB hub and directly near my power button is where it was brownish. I’m assuming this is where the motherboard fried. It seems to be not directly connected to my motherboard, however. Maybe replacing would be an option? I was able to get my data out of that laptop and onto an external drive which I’m grateful for.\n\nWe try to stick with TP-Link USB to Ethernet Adapters because that’s what we’ve always used for years. After our last one broke from being used for multiple years, we asked for tech department at our school for an adapter as we needed to configure our radio. They provided us with this one, also known as the laptop killer. It worked for a few months and then did this issue. We used this adapter multiple times for connecting to the radio and other ethernet projects we had going on. It never came to us that this would happen as it was working fine.\n\nThe Ethernet Adapter says USBRJ45 on it. When I googled it, it seemed to be an extremely cheap adapter found off of Amazon and mostly used as an extender. It did not have a sticker on it saying it was an extender so we didn’t even know this was it’s main purpose. It worked with our Ethernet needs and we used it for our off-season regional, so it’s weird that it worked with our Ethernet needs if it’s an extender, but we never had issues and never questioned it because we thought our tech department knew what they were doing.\n\nI’d willingly put money on that the adapter caused this issue. As unfortuante as it is, there’s not a whole lot I can do now. We have ordered 6 TP-Link adapters so that we have something reliable and have reported the incident to our tech department notifying them that their adapter they provided us caused this issue.\n\nThanks to everyone who’s been helping try to uncover what happened I’m going to assume it’s not everyday a laptop gets fried while working on an FRC project. We were all taken aback and decided to ask Chief Delphi to see if there was something major we did wrong here.\n\nIMG_6590 1920×2560 182 KB\n\nIMG_6590 1920×2560 182 KB\n\nIMG_6590 1920×2560 182 KB",
