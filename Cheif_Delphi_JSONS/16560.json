We have been looking at ways to toggle LED on the Launchpad controller we us or buzz the Xbox motors.\n\nThe pseudo exsample:\n\nDrivetrain subsystem has a shifter method to shift high/low. This method allows wishes to toggle a physical LED not a smartdashboard book. This method requires two parameters (boolean shifting, Joystick joy)\n\n’ public void shift(boolean shiftHi, Joystick joy){ If(shiftHi){ Psol.set(kfoward) joy.setOutPut(1,true) }else{ Psol.set(kreverce) joy.setOutPut(1,false) }\n\n} ’\n\nWe could pass the joystick to every Command that will manipulate the output like above so every shift Command MUST pass the launchpad.\n\nAll the other ideas we had like creating a Launchpad lighting subsystem that would join the action Command in a parallel commad group seemed more gross and seemed like we would have alot of duplicated code. The Right thing to do is put both actions together.\n\nJust thought of this:\n\nWould it be correct to have the Drivetrain subsystem require a joystick variable in its constructor? We would have to be sure the Joystick is created before the subsystem.\n\nWhat do you think?",

As I am not a Java Developer by career, I could have something about this incorrect, but it hopefully provides a good starting point.\n\nThe answer, like many other cases with dependency injection in Java, is Lambdas. While much of the focus has been on “Supplier” functions, they can also be used for other situations. A place I have found to look at options for these is the java.util.function page of Oracle’s JDK 11 documentation which has a list of \"Functional Interface\"s you can use for Lambdas. java.util.function (Java SE 11 & JDK 11 )\n\nSince Joystick.setOutput() returns void and we only need one variable (the state to set a particular output to) we can use the Consumer Functional Interface. I found a good example of using Consumer Lambdas here: Java Lambda - Consumer example\n\nOur Command Initialization, with the Lambda in question would look a little something like this.\n\nThe Command’s constructor would look a little something like this:\n\nThen, our execute where we would actually set the output would look something like this",

If needed, pass data sources as a BooleanSupplier / DoubleSupplier (specialized versions of the Supplier interface for unboxed primitives due to JVM generics).\n\nI like to think that my team organized this relatively well this year, see GitHub - ExcaliburFRC/IR2021 - specifically the RobotContainer and Superstructure files. We’ve noticed that with all the Command classes (such as InstantCommand, RunCommand, and the various command group types) there isn’t much need for custom commands - the only custom command we wrote was the ShootCommand nested in the Superstructure.",
