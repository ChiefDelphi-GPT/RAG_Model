                    "cooked": "We’re running Kraken X60’s on our MK4i’s for our drive motor and we’ve had this issue that pops up occasionally where one drive motor is inverted.\n\nThis only seems to happen on our front left module, which is the first to initialize which led us to think that the old Phoenix V5 bug where TalonFX inverts wouldn’t be set if they were set too early. In order to get around this we added a 1 second delay before initializing each of the modules to try to account for this. Unfortunately, this didn’t seem to fix the problem. At the Magnolia regional during one match the front left module wasn’t inverted properly and it caused us to drive very slowly (since that module was fighting all the other modules and going backwards).\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas as to what this problem could be? I haven’t heard of this happening to anyone else so I’m inclined to assume we’re doing something wrong or everyone else has found a workaround lol. Here is our kraken initialization code:\n\nNote that we confirm using Phoenix Tuner X that the motor has not been inverted properly while all the others have by not turning off the robot in matches where this has happened (it’s happened 3x now, we thought we fixed it after Arkansas but I guess not) and checking the motors invert compared to all the others.\n\n(Also thanks to 3937 and 8044 for helping us debug this during the Arkansas regional).",

After tracking it down, we found that the initial configuration worked just fine (your “apply” code above). However we also had a method that set the motor neutral mode that was getting called later. Our code for setting neutral mode looked like this:\n\nThe problem was that the call to “refresh” would sometimes fail.  This caused the subsequent “apply” call to use factory defaults for all settings other than NeutralMode, thus undoing our inverted setting.\n\nOur solution was to never call refresh.  Instead we keep the MotorOutputConfigs instance that we created in the constructor, and just modify that any time we want to make a change to NeutralMode.\n\nSo our code to set the neutral mode looks more like this:",

On enable, it calls unlimpModule() by default to make sure the motors are in brake mode however inside .setNeutralMode Phoenix calls refresh and then sets the brake mode config to that refreshed config. The refresh issue you were referring too earlier could then cause the problem that we’re facing.\n\nMy only concern with this is, why only the front left module? This has happened ~3 times so far and every time its been on specifically the front left module. The front left module is the one that does do all this on enable (we iterate through our swerve modules array and call unlimpModule() on each) so does that mean the refresh has a higher likelihood of failing on the first one, and not the rest? Does it have to do with the fact that refresh is blocking, maybe allowing the canbus queue to fill up or something like that? idk\n\nThanks for that suggestion!",

Given that everything within a robot loop needs to complete in under 20ms, you need to be careful about blocking calls. I agree with @Rezq that you’re probably OK here, you’re only calling it in enable and disable, not within your periodic loop.\n\nHowever if your problem is, in fact, that refresh() sometimes fails, a great fix for that would be the use the control request overrides instead. If you’re using Torque Current FOC , you would want to set the neutral mode configuration to brake, and then set OverrideCoastDurNeutral to true on your control request when the robot is enabled. If you’re using Voltage or Duty Cycle it’s the other way around, and you would set OverrideBrakeDurNeutral to true.",

When the robot is enabled and sending control requests you can override to coast, and when the robot is disabled it can be brake.\n\nDuty Cycle and Voltage allow you to configure to coast and override to brake in a control request, so unless the control reuqest takes effect when the robot is disabled, it won’t work.",
