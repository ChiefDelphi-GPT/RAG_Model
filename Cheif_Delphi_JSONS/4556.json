I want to move my robot right in front of the apriltag, like apriltag and my robot will be facing.\n\napriltagAlignment 1178×520 69.3 KB\n\napriltagAlignment 1178×520 69.3 KB\n\napriltagAlignment 1178×520 69.3 KB\n\nThis picture shows that what i want. Every possible pose (that camera can see the apriltag) should be able to make this happen.\n\nI thought of a method for this, robot wil turn due to tx(Yaw) data and will move sideway due to Skew data. But there is a problem. I have worked with Limelight before and with limelight i could get the Skew data. But i saw a note on Photonvision docs that says i can not get the skew data with apriltags.\n\nScreenshot_14 720×840 44.1 KB\n\nScreenshot_14 720×840 44.1 KB\n\nScreenshot_14 720×840 44.1 KB\n\nI tried getting it but it returns just 0. So it did not work.\n\nIs there something I don’t know? or what other method can I use?(expect odometry because ı dont trust the odometry right now)\n\nNote: I am working on Sim right now.",

Skew is a product of not having the camera pointed straight-on at the target - IE, you want to change robot yaw until skew reads zero. Once pointed at the same yaw as the target, moving sideways until the tag is centered image would yield alignment.\n\nThat being said, most I’ve worked with have gone down the path of solving this with 3d data. After calibrating the camera, the camera will produce Transform3d() objects which indicate where the target is at, relative to the camera. By projecting this onto the ground, and providing drivetrain commands that drive the transform to a desired position relative to the tag (say, 1 foot back, aligned in yaw, and 0 ft side to side), you can achieve the same alignment.\n\nI’m not entirely sure how well skew itself would work in this case, due to needing fairly high gains between the skew measurement (which will be noisy) and the drivetrain commands.\n\nAdditionally, note all these methods do not have latency compensation - you’ll need to make sure your pipeline is running with fairly low latency. Any latency just limits how aggressive your control gains to the drivetrain can be.  I’d spitball <100ms, but your mileage may vary.",

It’s much easier to center a tag via PID on the tx than it is to extract yaw info from the tag, especially head-on, due to tag ambiguity.\n\nOnce you’re centered on the tag and pushed up against the reef, you can use your now-known position to set your odometry for the next path towards the HP station (in auto). If you want to offset yourself to the left or right of the tag, just tweak the target tx to be offset from 0. For HP loading you can use the exact same strategy.\n\nIf you’re not super familiar with full 3D localization with tags, I think the above method will prove to be simple and reliable.",
