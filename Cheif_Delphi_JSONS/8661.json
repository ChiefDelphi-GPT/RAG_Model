You would have to pick two (where you only get both Through Bore inputs using a Brushed Motor, not a NEO).\n\nThe reason for this is that to use both relative encoders you need to use the Alternate Encoder Mode on the Spark MAX, which repurposes the Absolute/PWM Pin which the Through Bore Absolute Input would use for the Relative Encoder Quadrature input.\n\nI don’t know what your current use case is, but personally I would opt for the use of the NEO Relative Encoder and Through Bore Absolute Encoder, and just handle converting the relative encoder counts/position to that of the Through Bore’s position in software by calculating the gear ratio between the two. This would also give you access to the Limit Switches if you need them, and wouldn’t have the ~20RPM speed limit the use of the Alternate Encoder Mode would impose using a Through Bore Encoder’s relative output.\n\nYet Another option would be to use an analog absolute sensor for your absolute value input like a poteniometer (in case of only needing a few rotations) or an MA3 encoder (in the case of continuous rotation). You’d still lose the use of limit switches, but you could have the NEO Relative Encoder, Through Bore Relative Encoder, and Analog Absolute Encoder/Sensor. Of course this would add complexity with more sensors.",

Really you should try to have one that will trigger at the top of your motion too to stop over-extension, but the reason I specify one at the bottom in particular is that it makes a very convenient way to zero your relative encoder if your absolute encoder is out of commission in the event of some kind of position drift. You can create a Button object in your code that reads the state of the SparkMAX’s Limit Switch and use that to schedule a ‘zero encoder’ command when it is triggered.\n\nInclude a Limit Switch at, at least, the bottom of your elevator Motion.

Have a boolean variable and generic “get position” method in the subsystem that returns one of the two encoder methods from the above recommendation based on the value of the boolean variable (false = absolute encoder, true = relative encoder or visa-versa). Then you simply need some kind of trigger/button and Command that changes that boolean variable’s value to switch between your two encoder inputs without having to complicate your other commands or their triggers/buttons.

Fine tune that health check, put it in a method returning a boolean health status, tie that to a Button, and have it handle automatic switch-over (though make sure you have an override)",

This basically means that it’ll tell you what angle it’s currently rotated to, but not how many times it has previously been rotated. Most elevator designs that I’m familiar with require several rotations of the output pulley in order to extend fully, so this might be something you need to think through.",
