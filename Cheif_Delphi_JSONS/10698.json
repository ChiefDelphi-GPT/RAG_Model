                    "cooked": "Dassault recently announced that starting in July new Solidworks desktop licenses will include a cloud service.\n\nStarting in July 2023, all new purchases of SOLIDWORKS Desktop CAD licenses (Perpetual, Term, Standalone, or Network) will include Cloud Services as part of the Subscription.\n\nAll existing SOLIDWORKS Desktop CAD Subscription licenses will have the opportunity, for a nominal fee, to upgrade to Subscription with Cloud Services, but they will have the flexibility to continue to renew their usual Subscription, if they prefer.\n\nDoes anyone know how this will affect existing and future FIRST Solidworks users? My team has traditionally been a Solidworks team and used GrabCAD for design sharing. However, the pandemic left us with a dearth of CAD experience and with the imminent loss of GrabCAD we switched to Fusion 360 for the year. We now have a handful of members with some experience with CAD but who are generally unhappy with F360.\n\nThe two options we are considering are returning to Solidworks, or switching to OnShape. We know a fair number of other teams who like OnShape, but we do view Solidworks as the more capable tool. Really, the only problem with Solidworks is the lack of a sharing system.\n\nWe haven’t tried 3DExperience because, frankly, we have found the on-boarding process to be off-putting. Old advice was that it wasn’t worth the effort, and we realize that Dassault has put a lot of effort into making it better, but not being able to directly control organization membership is a big problem.\n\nWe would love to try PDM vault, but we do not have a server of our own and we can’t afford to pay for a 7/24 cloud service to run it on. Has anyone gotten it running on a free-tier cloud service?\n\nOn the other hand, if we can expect that we will have a cloud service included with Solidworks next year, that would clinch the decision for us, I think, especially if we could start using it in July, so we would have the summer to get used to it. Does anyone know anything about the service? Also, if I am wrong about 3DExperience, either in knowing a way to add and remove members directly, or that it is improved enough to make the difficulty worthwhile, please post it.\n\nThanks for any info or thoughts on the subject you can provide.",

As you’ve possibly discovered, F360 manages to combine the worst aspects of cloud-based and desktop software. I think you’ll find OnShape very capable coming from a SW world, with maybe 1 or 2 notable exclusions (which are easy enough to work around). It’s certainly the most intuitive of the cloud-based CAD solutions, though I’m sure PTC will find a way to mess that up soon enough (plz no).\n\nMy recent experiences with 3DX have been “this is good, but not for me”. As a larger organization there’s a lot of like; at work we used it mostly to deal with people that wanted to nose around CAD, but the whole ecosystem was decent enough in my few days setting things up and trying it out.\n\nI think we can bug @Nick.kremer about changes to the SW sponsorship?",

We use it for work and it’s great, but it takes a lot of work/ some cost to setup and maintain and is probably too much for most teams. There are some teams that do it though or are at least attempting it.\n\nFor 3DX vs OnShape I’d probably recommend OnShape based on the FRC ecosystem alone. Tons of teams use it, there are tons of FRC specific add ins for it, and you’ll have no trouble finding FRC support for it. I’m curious myself though to learn more about 3DX.\n\nIt’s been interesting seeing signs that industry might be making a mass push towards the cloud based model (for better or worse). Talking to the Autodesk reps at worlds they basically said outright that they’re pushing fusion 360 over inventor for lots of applications and referred to inventor as more of a “CAD 1.0” vs fusion 360 being the “CAD 2.0” I can’t say for sure but with this announcement from Dassault but it seems like the same thing could start happening with SolidWorks users being gently pushed towards 3DX. It’s interesting too how PTC acquired OnShape and the past few years I haven’t heard many mentions about Pro E/Creo (although obviously many still use it.)\n\nThis is mostly speculation of course. The big programs like Inventor, SolidWorks, and Creo are here to stay at least in some capacity.",

OnShape is more like Google Docs, and the collaborative activity is WAY easier.  Maybe if you’re a large team, with multiple mentors experienced in managing PDM functions, and the time to do that, the 3DX would work.\n\nThis really is annoying, as we’ve used SW for many years, but as we’ve gotten more students trained in CAD (3-4 as opposed to our usual 1-2) the inability to file share via the cloud became a problem.  We’d prefer to use SW, as it’s a far more mature, stable, and industry standard application and the one most students will encounter out in the work world; but the file sharing and collaborative functionality requires resources we just don’t have.  Since OnShape was created by the same folks as created SW, it’s similar enough that the transition (for us mentors) isn’t too bad.  The whole “mates” thing is challenging for us “old dogs”; not being able to use “planes” to mate parts is extremely frustrating.",

I spent a short while trying to learn it using some of the suggested resources, but quickly stopped when most training videos on youtube were 45 minute-long seminars or, at best, 5-7 minute long videos. I can fully explain how to set up and use grabcad in about a minute. PDM seems to be a fair bit more work for equal if not more complicated functionality.\n\nOf course I’m happy to be proven wrong, but so far I’ve yet to find any resources that show me how to use PDM in a simple, braindead manner. We’ll probably end up using dropbox or google drive, as bad as they are as solutions, just because it’s something I can easily get students to use.",

Our school has been solidworks historically and we switched to Fusion 360 and the students really like it. I came from tinkercad so… Fusion 360 is mind blowing to me. We make good use of the rendering and animation tools. The interface is easy enough to understand and we can produce files for our lab equipment.\n\nMy only complaint has ever been the fact that it’s cloud based, but since all 3 major choices (solidworks, OnShape and Fusion 360) are all cloud based now it’s kind of moot.\n\nAm I just too inexperienced to see why Fusion 360 is a bad choice?\n\nEdit: we do have a combined team where the students can all work together, share files ,etc and they know how to work it. We don’t use comments really but we haven’t had too many issues with students ruining each other’s work or not being able to locate files we need. We have a common file tree they use and specific student folders for their work. It’s really nice from what I experienced trying to get files to export and slice for printing.",

                    "cooked": "Sure.  I’m a biochemist, and self-taught on CAD (Solidworks via FIRST), and now the lead CAD mentor for out team.  I’ve run classes in the fall for several years now, usually two “sections” of introductory CAD with anywhere from 3-6 kids per section; this past year I did one “advanced” section, getting a little deeper into SW functions.  This past year, we had about 4-5 kids who were experienced enough with CAD to be truly useful in designing the robot.  They had a heck of a time trying to collaborate, pack-and-go sending each other models with flaws in them (mates that blew up, links that failed).  Granted, most of the problems were errors in how they built their models, but they’re kids, right? Now that we’re past competition, I dug into the Solidworks cloud collaboration software, which runs through their 3DExperience portal.  I’ve used various software in my work life (biopharma process development and manufacturing) that had workflow built in: a manager creates a project, assigns it to a supervisor, they share it with their team, coordinate their teams’ efforts in working on it, and then send it back to the manager when it’s finished.  The manager then shares it with their peers, and so on and so forth up the chain.  The SW PDM requires the same amount of organization and effort; and given that the students have likely never even heard of “workflow”, trying to get them learn and use it would take even longer than teaching them the basics of CAD.  Plus, even though I’m retired, I don’t have the time to monitor each student’s efforts, and meld them together.  And taking the time to try and teach even one of the best students to fill that role would be a lost cause; we’re at a high school in which virtually all the students are focused (or maybe just their parents are) on getting into very competitive colleges and universities.  Throw in their other extracurricular activities, and there’s no way they can commit the time and effort to running a “CAD department” for the team.  During midterm week (right in the middle of build season), we basically lose the entire team to their studying for exams.\n\nCAD is just one of the activities on the team I mentor; I’m also one of the two mechanical mentors for design, fabrication, build and wiring.  3DX would be a good tool if you have a large enough team and dedicated mentors to focus on teaching and managing a dedicated CAD team; for us, it’s just too complicated and labor intensive for a one man show and a handful of inexperienced kids.",

There’s a lot I like about OnShape vs. SW, and the ability to collaborate virtually like Google Docs (which the kids already know how to do better than me) was the deciding factor. There’s stuff I miss (like the ability to mate using planes; the whole totally different approach to mates in OnShape vs. SW is a source of frustration for this “old dog”), but overall, I think the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.",

It’s a great place to start if you’re learning, or need to learn the difference in your tools from other programs. They have a ton of self guided courses. Then when you need to get to FRC specifics, I suggest @cadandcookies videos on YouTube , and a series from the robo chargers . And spectrum has done a few design analysis videos in onshape as well.\n\ncheck out Onshape4frc , it’s a great resource for getting started. Gives you details about all the FRC based feature scripts and MKCAD and stuff.\n\nI taught myself how to do cad (because outherwise we wouldn’t have a design mentor) between the 2021 and 2022 seasons and these are the resources I used.\n\nIn my view, the only draw back to onshape is there’s no CAM, but apparently they recently bought out a cloud based CAM company so I would assume it’s coming soon.",
