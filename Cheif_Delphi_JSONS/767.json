I don’t know how to revert my settings but I have a feeling it might be something else. When the camera is right against the tag and it is in full view it cuts in  and out like it is unsure if it sees it. Also The camera stream is really laggy. I was reading over the docs for something that I missed but I didn’t find anything. We have a OV9281 ArduCam with an Orange Pi 5 and we run it off a mobile battery onboard the robot. Thanks for reading over my problems",

I’d also like to know a little bit more about your camera setup? What resolution, how many cameras?\n\nAs for lagginess, is that a problem with the actual processing, or just the web display? In the PhotonVision UI, you can select two resolutions: a regular resolution as well as a stream resolution. To the best of my understanding, the resolution is the resolution that the camera is being read and processed at, whereas the stream resolution is the video resolution that is actually being streamed to the web UI. This allows you to reduce the amount of network traffic while still keeping your AprilTag processing the same. Perhaps reduce your stream resolution, and see if that affects lagginess. All of the AprilTag identification processing is happening on the coprocessor, so you don’t really need to have a very high stream quality. It won’t affect how your code handles the AprilTags, as all the code gets is data about where the tag is, not the original image (unless you specifically try to save those). Here’s a good guide from PhotonVision on that.\n\nAs well, I believe that Photonvision also displays latency in their dashboard, and this latency seems to be for the actual processing rather than the stream. This can tell you more about if the issue you’re experiencing is processing lag, or a slow stream (the latter is less indicative of a real issue).\n\nimage 768×482 25.2 KB Latency display in red text next to FPS info\n\nimage 768×482 25.2 KB\n\nimage 768×482 25.2 KB\n\nIf I’m correctly understanding your post, the AprilTag is “in full view” so it should be detected by PhotonVision. If it is in full view (nothing obstructing it or any corners cut off, as well as lack of glare), I’d say you may want to try to mess around with either your exposure settings or the AprilTag Tuning/Tracking settings .\n\nAlso, you can revert your settings in PhotonVision really easily if you download your settings frequenly. Inside of the PhotonVision settings page, you will find some options to save your settings. Our team tries to do this whenever we make any changes. You will download a file that you should keep safe, and then re-upload that file to completely restore settings from any point in time. It’s a pretty nifty feature. I’d recommend trying to do this at least once, if you find something you like.\n\nMy team uses 4 OV9281s and an Orange Pi 5 for AprilTags, and we’ve learned that if you use the 1 USB 3 port, and get a USB 3-capable dongle, you can run 4 cameras at 240x320 resolution at a little over 100 FPS. This has worked really well for us, and the accuracy, even at such a low resolution, is surprisingly good. One thing we learned is that it’s really important to make sure that the cameras are plugged into the fast USB 3 slot on the Orange Pi, otherwise you may either lose data or the cameras won’t read right and bad stuff happens.",
