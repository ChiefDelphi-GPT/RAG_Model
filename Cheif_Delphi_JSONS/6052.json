                    "cooked": "So my team is getting a 7500$ grant within the next week, I have expressed heavy interest in getting full-Kraken swerve with the pigeon 2 gyro and cancoders, as well as Pre-Order: Thrifty Swerve: 5 Modules + Frame + Tread Bundle swerve modules. My mentor has agreed to all of this, and it would be around 3850$ and doesn’t include extra motors or anything.\n\nI guess my question would be is it worth it? that’s a lot of money, and we also have to buy the software for the motors which is 200$, our robot would be fast and we are capable of fully coding and assembling the swerve. But is it worth it? Should we order different parts?\n\nAlso, a separate question, we don’t have a PDH right now, and I figure it would be smart to practice making swerve before the season so should we also order one of those? We are getting one in the rookie kit (my team is in an awkward position where our past school took some of our stuff but not all of it), so is it worth spending that extra 200$ or should we wait until kickoff?",

If you’ve been part of a different team, you should have some idea of that overall expense.  Be sure to do the math on the full robot before making your swerve decision.\n\nIf your team has the funds, the new Thrifty kit is on the lower cost side of getting into swerve.  Going with Krakens rather than NEOs adds about $650 to the total, but avoiding the space and wiring issues with SparkMAXes is valuable.  The CTRE software is also a step up from the Rev software.  With the Thrifty modules being new, there might be some growing pains, but I’d trust Thrifty and Ryan Dognaux to do whatever it takes to make sure customers have a good experience.\n\nIt certainly seems worthwhile to get a PDH now if your team is going to be able to meet in the fall to build, program, and drive a swerve chassis.  The extra PDH sounds like it will complete a set of all the  primary electronics, which is great to have around as spares.  Until you have enough swerve modules to use the second set to make a practice/alpha robot, you can use the extra PDH to safely power prototypes while the main PDH is installed on the competition robot.",

It’s been reliable, easy to package due to the integrated motor controllers, and relatively easy to get coded.",

There is so much more than just having a very good drive-train to have a successful robot.\n\nInstead, probably need to look at tools (hand/power/3d-printer/larger machines), robot parts (spare/dev RIO/ PDH /Radio, sensor, metal/wood/lexan, wires, 3d filament if you plan on using 3d printer, computers/monitors/graphics cards (CAD and Programming), etc.\n\nmetal tubes’ pricing has gotten really bad especially if you don’t have any local suppliers and requires shipping too.\n\nNot knowing what resources you guys have now, I would suggested that you/your mentors to reach out to some local-nearby teams to see if they will be willing to help mentor you guys as a team.  [often time even just knowing who can lean you spare parts can be differences between having a robot at comp vs waiting to get to comp to finish building your robot].",

While REV was fairly responsive to those issues, the motors still proved to be a poor investment for our team, so much so that we rush-ordered a full CTRE swerve setup over a weekend to run it at our third event with next to no testing, and it still performed more accurately and reliably than our 8x Vortex drivetrain.\n\nFor a swerve, through-shaft doesn’t help and is arguably counterproductive. The Krakens are also clearing their back order currently.\n\nIf you‘re already set up to build a robot (parts/tools from prior teams) and this grant is available primarily to buy a swerve, I can’t recommend enough that you prefer the CTRE control ecosystem over REV. You don’t need Phoenix Pro though, and I can’t speak to recommendations on swerve modules.\n\nI know I’m recommending the more expensive path, but in our experience, the extra cost was worth the build time and matches that would have been saved this season.",

If you like CTRE , do full CTRE electronics in your preferred mechanical platform ( SDS , WCP , Thrifty, etc).  Trying to mix and match SDS modules with NEO 1.1 and Thrifty encoders did our troubleshooting zero favors last season, to the point that we abandoned swerve and went back to an AM14U.\n\nThat said, it is clear to me that\n\nSwerve is becoming table stakes in modern FRC so I don’t fault any team for shelling out on it.\n\nTeams who went full CTRE had their faith rewarded in 2024, so I don’t fault any team for shelling out on that.\n\nPDH : See if anyone around you can loan you one.  Even an older PDP would get you rolling, just with fewer slots for other things.  But also, a second PDH is good to have in case your kit of parts one experiences issues.  Or if you just want to have two robots driving around.\n\nOtherwise, I endorse the Spectrum lists.  I also did a presentation for the local Kickoff about stretching budgets which might be useful.",
