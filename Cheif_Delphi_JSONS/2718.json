                    "cooked": "Currently, my team has a vision system using two Limelight 3Gs to align to branches of the reef, and it works very well. To select which branch and face to align to, the driver uses the A, B, X, Y, LB, and RB buttons to select the face, and the LT and RT buttons to select the left or right branch respectively. Through a combination of these buttons and using the pathplanner library, our robot can align to any branch quickly.\n\nHowever, in the heat of a match, it is common for the driver to make mistakes and go to the wrong branch, losing time and cycles in the process. My question for the programmers out there is how we can make this process more intuitive for the driver to maximize our scoring potential? TIA",

We then also have both driver input and automatic input running constantly (well, if the robot has a coral and we’re relatively close to the reef), we scale how much the robot has control and how much the driver has control based on both distance to alignment goal and how the magnitude of the drive controller (pushing it further → more control for me, nudging it a bit → more control for robot)\n\nThis approach definitely has flaws and our implementation (its on github but the code is messy) could use some is tuning, however overall it works pretty well and rarely aligns to the wrong position, if it does its also easy to correct with the joystick, and if alignment isnt perfect im also able to correct for it with the joysticks still.",
