The text describes the process of creating a simpler rigging system compared to extrusions, focusing on adding pulleys and changing the hardware. \n\nThe key benefits include eliminating the need for machinebolts or matching-bolts on the pulleys, reducing the number of parts required, and simplifying the overall construction process. This allows for more efficient installation and maintenance. The solution involves using simple, 3D-printed pulleys and press-fit <span class=\"abbreviations\">SDS<template class=\"tooltiptext\" data-text=\"Swerve Drive Specialties\"></template></span> elevator blocks, which make internal routing much cleaner. \n\nThis approach ensures that lines run precisely parallel to the extrusion, minimizing tension variations and providing consistent performance during operation. Additionally, the use of durable materials such as PBT (polystyrene-butylene-tetrafluoroethylene) and easily-machined steel enables the creation of simple pulleys and press-fit adaptor components, further streamlining the manufacturing process.\n\nThe final output demonstrates how this method achieves nearly perfect alignment of the rigging lines, a significant improvement over previous methods.",

I had the same idea right before kickoff XD. I looked up similar ideas but didn't find anything close to what I wanted. The main constraint was having to use only tube routers and belt saws without any CNC machines. I tried creating my own solution with bearing blocks but realized it wasn't feasible. My first attempt involved large billet bearing blocks, which didn't work. I asked for help, and someone suggested trying a different approach. After failing, I thought differently and came up with a new idea involving shorter bearing blocks. This led to a successful outcome.",

Red marks show the retraction string's attachment point, while yellow highlights the connection to the carriage. A blue depiction illustrates the string's flow direction.\n\nThe string descends from the spool, bends around two pulleys near the outside stage, ascends over a pulley on the bearing block, and then descends between the outside and first moving stage. This sequence repeats as the string moves through the first moving stage toward the innermost stage. Within the innermost stage, the string connects to tensioning loops visible in the photos.\n\nThe string traverses the \"bottom\" stage relative to this viewpoint before shifting between the bottom and middle stages. Additional photos depict the string running through various stages.\n\nPlease let me know if any corrections are needed.\n\n---",
