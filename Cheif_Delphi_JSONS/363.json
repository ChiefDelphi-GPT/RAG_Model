Now, I'm seeking advice on three main aspects:  \n1. How to properly drive it  \n2. Torque and RPM settings  \n3. The feasible degree of rotation  \n\nWe’re considering aiming for approximately 6000 RPM and allowing for up to 270 degrees of rotation. Our goal is for it to consistently make a three-point shot on a basketball hoop with a high success rate of 95/100 attempts.",

Additionally, 2012 videos are also worth exploring.  \n\nHow to drive it? SWERVE BABY!!! Just kidding; the best approach is likely a tank with air tires, as I’ve driven many robots during the main season. People aren’t too fond of the tread marks left by Swerve.  \n\nWe’re aiming for approximately 6000rpm and 270 degrees of rotation. If accurate, 270 rpm was pretty standard in 2022.  \n\nOur goal is to consistently make three-point shots (95/100). To achieve this, consider mounting an Apr tag at the same height and a few inches forward of the goal. A diagram shows this setup.  \n\nIf you bring your own goal, attaching an Apr tag shouldn’t be too difficult. For illumination, a limelight isn’t essential—it might be overkill. Alternatively, explore photon vision, though it requires some setup.  \n\nIn summary, this project is exciting, but as a programmer, I’m limited in mechanical advice. Let me know if you need help building it!",

This necessitates setting your shooting wheel's linear speed accordingly, as higher speeds mean less energy loss during the shot. Additionally, we found it beneficial to measure RPM, abbreviated as revolutions per minute, based on the wheel size.\n\nWhile setting up the shooting wheel was a critical step, we wish to highlight another improvement: installing a second wheel or roller at the top of the hood. Currently, we're generating excessive backspin on the basketball, leading to inefficiency. By introducing a supplementary wheel, we can distribute the rotational force more evenly, enhancing control and reducing wasted energy.",
