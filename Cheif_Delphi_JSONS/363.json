Just kidding your best bet is probably some kind of tank with air tires so you can drive it in all different places. I have been to a lot of different out reach with main season robots, and I will say people do not really like the tread marks swerve leaves behind.\n\nwe’re thinking around 6000rpm and 270 degrees of rotation\n\nif I am correct 270 was really standard in 2022 (or at least that’s what we had)\n\nwe want it to be able to make a 3point shot on a basketball hoop consistently (95/100 makes)\n\nthat is probably going to be fairly hard but also possible some solutions, I can think of is to have an April tag that you can put at the same height and a few inches forward of the goal. probably going to need something like this\n\nBut if you guys are bringing your own goal to places somehow it should not really be to big of a problem to mount an April tag directly to the goal.\n\nand if you do not have the budget for a limelight or you guys cant get one you should look into photon vision, its a bit less plug in play but I heard its still really solid.\n\nIn conclusion\n\nThis is a very cool idea and I think it would be great if you guys could get it fully working!

You can hear them throughout our reveal, and that’s with the volume turned way down. Everyone working on it had earplugs for test sessions. I wouldn’t necessarily recommend it, but if you go this route, please be very careful and get a mentor to review it for safety. It is important that your flywheels are well-balanced and best if you can put a cage around them on the robot.\n\nTo hit from 3pt range, you will need the basketball to be going at least ~35 ft/s, which means the linear speed of your shooting wheel needs to be similar (and not lose energy during the shot, which is why we had big flywheels). The RPM depends on the size of your shooting wheel.\n\nI will also note something that we wished we changed - You should have a second wheel/roller at the top of the hood. We were wasting a lot of energy into putting an absurd amount of backspin onto the ball. You want some, probably, but not as much as you get if you have a single wheel powerful enough to shoot 3 point shots.",

                    "cooked": "270° of travel is a reasonable number. I know that many teams in 2022 had around that much travel. Depending on your desires, you could explore doing more travel on a turret, so having to “unwrap” the turret is less common. Teams like 2910 and 254 had roughly 720° of travel on their turrets in 2024, which made them better at a role that required them to turn the robot a lot when intaking.\n\nI hope you’re referring to the flywheel speed and not the final reduction on the turret, because 6000 RPM is an extremely high number for turret rotation. At that speed, you’re looking at a full 270° sweep in under 8 milliseconds.\n\nThe motor power required to do this, coupled with the absurd speeds and the control loop timing, could easily tear this mechanism apart the first time it tried to run anywhere close to full speed.\n\nFor some context: tracking a stationary goal while moving laterally at 20 ft/s halfway to the 3pt line only demands about 100°/sec of turret rotation. Even accounting for drivetrain rotation in the opposite direction at 360°/sec, 400–500°/sec (70–80 RPM ) is already generous and gives you the headroom needed for fast, responsive aiming.\n\nAs for flywheel speeds: you can calculate an appropriate exit velocity based on the distances you want to shoot. Once you have a target exit velocity, you can back-calculate the necessary wheel surface speed. If you’re using a passive hood, your shooter wheels will need a surface speed roughly twice your desired exit velocity. Keep in mind that real-world factors like slip and compression losses can reduce your actual exit speed, so it’s smart to prototype and validate your numbers, or leave some headroom for tuning.\n\nAll of my math is back-of-the-napkin, so I heavily suggest doing your own calculations to find a good speed for your turret given the power and torque available from the motor you will have driving it and your desired tracking speeds, or at the very least, reference the ratios that teams have used in the past. I’d also look at the CAD that teams have published for turrets they have used in the past for inspiration on how to package and power them.",
