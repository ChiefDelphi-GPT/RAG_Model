All seriousness, I did incorporate some of the feedback I got, both in public and from people reaching out to me, but I’ve also added a few more pages. I’m very sorry to the person who wanted a nav bar, but I promise that I didn’t add nav bars that dont take you back to the home page just to spite you. Anyways!!! I think it’s looking pretty good, but I am once again back asking for more opinions. https://metrobots.github.io/",

                    "cooked": "The website is looking awesome! Fantastic work! I pulled up your GitHub account after you posted the initial version hosted at https://mateo-johnson.github.io to take a look at the code you had going for it. I had a couple questions or considerations for you after seeing what you were doing there.\n\nThings would probably feel easier to look at, and as the site grows they will feel easier to maintain if you pull out your js and css to external files. This also will make whatever work you do in js or css reusable, as you can reference the same file in multiple locations. It looks like you are actually already referencing font awesome through a <style src={source}> to get some styling from font awesome, you can add multiple sources to a single page.\n\nI am going to second the opinion of whoever said that a nav bar would be a nice touch. It feels unnecessary to have to go back to the home page in order to get to another page on the site, ideally everything takes as few clicks as possible to get to. If you had some HTML that you wanted to reuse, you could create a js function that would then assign it as the inner contents of a named div in your html. this article from freecodecamp seems to have a solid explanation of how you could accomplish this, or here is a related discussion on stack overflow .\n\nFinally, I think a cool project could be entirely building your calendar dynamically using JS could be a cool challenge and a great learning opportunity for you. I see you have a a comment in the html that says “use class=“today” to make a date grayed out”, this would require a daily, manual change to your html to change the “today” date on the calendar, and since your calendar is built in a .html file, you would need to rebuild it every month. Building it in JS would allow it to render for each client each time they pull up the page.\n\nOverall this site is awesome. It looks fantastic and seems to be able to provide some excellent content about your team. I have always had a soft spot for the super minimal home screens, so as my team starts to think about making some changes to our site this summer, I will definitely be talking about some of the things you have done.",

This also will make whatever work you do in js or css reusable, as you can reference the same file in multiple locations.
