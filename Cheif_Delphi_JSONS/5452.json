I’ve tried following the instructions on how to run WPIcal from source, but I have no experience managing C++ extensions and I keep getting errors. My latest error is with configuring the cmake project, as whenever I run cmake -S . -B build -G \"Visual Studio 17 2022\" -T ClangCl -A x64 -DVCPKG_ROOT=<path/to/vcpkg> I get errors saying “ Could not find toolchain file: <path/to/vcpkg>/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake ”. Does anyone know how to install WPIcal from source? Or better yet, is there a way to install a WPILib beta with WPIcal as a built-in Tool?",
