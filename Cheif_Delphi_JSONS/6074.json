However, since then, many major updates have been released, far too many to count. Here are a few of the key updates:\n\nTrue theming support & better overall look & feel\n\nDrag & Drop\n\nNew Widgets Graphs FMSInfo Command Activation Swerve\n\nGraphs\n\nFMSInfo\n\nCommand Activation\n\nSwerve\n\nSwitch tabs based on an NT key\n\nDramatic performance & QoL improvements Field2d fixes More performant overall CameraView performance & reconnection behavior StringChooser reconnect behavior; forces previous choice onto the robot upon redeploy/reboot No updating of items not in view\n\nField2d fixes\n\nMore performant overall\n\nCameraView performance & reconnection behavior\n\nStringChooser reconnect behavior; forces previous choice onto the robot upon redeploy/reboot\n\nNo updating of items not in view\n\nSignificant reduction in crashes Various internal refactors fixed crashes and improved usability\n\nVarious internal refactors fixed crashes and improved usability\n\nTested Windows (setup, portable) & macOS (.app) builds\n\nHere is a quick refresher on the key features that separate QFRCDashboard from other alternatives.\n\nQFRCDashboard is incredibly performant. It’s been designed from day one to have the smallest possible CPU, RAM, and network footprints.\n\nWritten in the high-performance language, C++\n\nPainting of widgets is done on a deferred, nonrestrictive basis\n\nNT updates are done as-needed, not periodically\n\nQFRCDashboard contains numerous additional widgets alongside the most useful found in Shuffleboard. Some have extra features too.\n\nEnum widget: change color based on a string value\n\nBool/enum widgets have customizable shape options\n\nSwerve view\n\nField2d has customizable robot size\n\nPowerful, customizable graphs w/ CSV export & multi-value support\n\nQFRCDashboard was never designed with UI eye-candy in mind, but steps have been taken to ensure it is as functional as possible while being non-intrusive. The user experience is designed to be simple without compromising on powerful features.\n\nQFRCDashboard is in a 100% serviceable and usable state; as a driver I ran with QFRCDashboard for all of our events last year.\n\nHowever, it would be downright blasphemous to claim it’s complete or perfect. Here are some updates that are planned in the near future\n\nQML Rewrite This will take a long while, but will dramatically improve the smoothness, look & feel of the application\n\nThis will take a long while, but will dramatically improve the smoothness, look & feel of the application\n\nDocumentation on usage\n\nImproved UX\n\nDocumentation on creating custom widgets\n\nNote that due to the nature of a QML rewrite, this will take priority and the latter two features inherently rely on this being completed first.\n\nUnfortunately, this will take a long time, as I have a significantly less niche project ( mirror ) in the works.\n\nRegardless, I can promise you that QFRCDashboard’s rewrite will be complete by the time Week 1 rolls around. Check out OpenFitnessPal in the meantime, and know that QFRCDashboard is perfectly usable in its current state.\n\nI’m super glad to continue development of QFRCDashboard for the coming years, and I would be remiss to not give a massive thanks to the incredible people at Team 6032 for taking me in with open arms and a willingness to help with my development efforts of QFRCDashboard and other FRC -related projects, including a scouting app ( mirror ) and a Phoenix 6-like API for MCs, swerve, etc ( mirror ). More on those two will come in separate posts down the line; stay tuned.\n\nP.S. due to some odd git log-smashing shenanigans the commit history is janked up. I’ll do my best to get that fixed soon.",

Some features have been removed due to high maintenance load relative to their lack of usefulness, including:\n\nGraphs\n\nSwerve Widget\n\nAs outlined in the previous posts, many new quality-of-life features have been completed.\n\nDrag & Drop from the side widget menu directly\n\nSide menus for CameraServer & NetworkTables\n\nChange widget types at-will\n\nImproved enum & sendable widgets\n\nMuch improved widget config menu\n\nBetter performance & less resource usage\n\nStringChooser is much easier to work with Overall, the dashboard experience has been dramatically improved and smoothed out, making it much easier to use from the driver perspective while keeping the same performance.\n\nHowever, I, as a developer, simply can’t test everyone’s use case, and there are certainly bugs that are unaccounted for based on situations I myself have never encountered. Plus, I’ve only really tested in simulation, so things like the CameraViews are almost entirely untested.\n\nI would appreciate help on this! I encourage anyone who may have interest in QFRCDashboard to help beta-test this rewrite, provide feedback, and find any bugs that need squashing.\n\nYou can find the relevant builds in the PR ( Direct link to artifacts ).",
