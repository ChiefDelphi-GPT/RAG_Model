I do have 2 Rev 2 meter distance sensors and 3  Rev color sensors V3. I did put 2 V3 in one side and 2 , 2 meter  distance sensors on the other. I did get this thing to work out but I’m having a problem with the Rev color sensors as from the 3 Color V3 sensors I got 2 of them are making the motors work not in constant speed but playing in 0.5 and 0.2 of power . Could it be the sensors are broken ? or there is something I can make to fix this. The other V3 Sensor works perfect .

So I’d graph the raw outputs as the sensors approach the wall. That could give you good insight into what the sensors are doing and what you can do about it to accommodate them.\n\nYou didn’t mention if they don’t work at 4 inches but are okay at 1 or 2 inches. Since the whole point of the sensors is to detect light, you can get better or worse detection depending on the ambient lighting. On our robot we had to add another bright LED to illuminate the target area well enough to get the range we needed.\n\nThe LEDs that were used to illuminate are sensitive to the supply voltage and we noticed the LEDs were significantly dimmer with more motors, speed, acceleration, weight of the robot, etc. We had to write algorithms that tolerated a wide variation in absolute raw output of the sensor.\n\nYou can get more stable illumination using a voltage regulator.",

WPILib Debouncer might work as a spike filter or something like this that I found on the Internet. Adjust parameters for the lag that you can tolerate.\n\nIt’s hard to diagnose a slightly bad sensor but it’s easy to tug and wiggle wires to find poor connections.

Super frustrating for 10-11 year olds.\n\nFun fact: I used this experience to get funding to get ALL Detroit FTC teams full fields. So there was a great outcome from our pain.",

For example, if you have no problem with 1 sensor and then you connect the 2nd and 3rd, that could indicate you didn’t change the I2C address of the 2nd and 3rd sensor if they are on the same bus which is the typical case (even if they appear to be separate ports). You can prove that by running a “failed” sensor as the first and only one connected and see if it works. Do that for the other “failed” sensor and test that one alone, too.\n\nThe chances of failed hardware are very slim compared to bad code or misapplication. You haven’t considered all the possibilities yet (at least you haven’t shared them with us).",
