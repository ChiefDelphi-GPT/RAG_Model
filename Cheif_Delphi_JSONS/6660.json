Leaving the only thing left to do being the actual programming for the robot. Effectively everything you can already do in VS Code, just simplified in a great-looking UI.\n\nOf course, just like every program meant to make a more complex job easier, this would help making projects quick and easy as well as making changing YAGSL configuration and stuff just a little bit easier and faster, but then again it reduces customizability. Then again, one could go back and customize to their heart’s content after project creation… I don’t have a concrete idea in my head yet.\n\nMy question for the time being is: Would your team benefit from an application like this? Do you think other teams would as well? The primary purpose of this would be to teach myself application development, but if I can end up making something useful, double win.",

The only reason that I don’t like the idea of an app dedicated to simply configuring existing YAGSL files is that it’s not exactly worth downloading an app only for that purpose when you can just go edit the JSON files without much difficulty. If it were a larger scoped application, it might actually be worth downloading. As I said though, I do agree that it’s a good starting point.\n\nAnkur-Raghavan:\n\nYAGSL has a gui configurator, but last I used it, it wasn’t that useful or obvious what thing meant, it just took your inputs and made the actual json files\n\nThat is something I did not mention but I want it to be a key feature in this application: Providing detailed and helpful summaries of each field and how it affects the robot, as well as perhaps adding preset values for certain fields like the grip coefficient, for example, could have presets for TPU on smooth concrete, TPU on field carpet, etc. I know this information is available with a pretty quick internet search, but to have it all there would be nice. Another slight disadvantage is that the existing YAGSL config page, if I am thinking of the same one, is web-based and may not be available in a FRC event.",

(We’re focused on the C++ port and then a few quality of life fixes). If you want to make an app we will try to support and maintain it afterwards. Ideally we would have something like the tuner x swerve generator. I have even discussed the exact steps necessary and what the application flow for this is in the YAGSL discord server , if you do decide you want to make this you won’t be starting from step 0.\n\nGood luck! Let me know if you do want to pursue this!!",

(Is there place I can learn about the NetworkTables protocol and how to use it in my own apps?)\n\njdaming:\n\nYou can see that this is one of our priorities that I have been working on. I want it to be an extension in VSCode that teams can use easily without needing a separate program.\n\nIf this was directly implemented in VS Code, that would be way better than an external app. Just makes managing and installing vendor deps that much faster without having to grab the URLs for each.",
