                    "cooked": "#1 … Thinking about wiring is a very good sign.  Having a plan that has some flexibility, will take you far.\n\nRead the manual.  Minimum Wire sizes and colors for DC circuits are called out and must be followed. The minimum gauge (size) is relative to the circuit protection (snap action breaker).  The breakers help protect the wires from overheating if the load starts pulling too much current, or the wires get shorted.\n\nOutside of the rules, you will want to figure out best practices for your team. Items to look into and decide: Connectors (or no connectors)… having good secure low resistance connectors is important.  Lots of teams have their favorites with reasons why.  There are Pros and Cons to pretty much any connector.  Without connectors, it can be hard to replace motors/sensors… Labeling.  Labeling wires at each end can be very very helpful in keeping things straight and helping root cause problems. Seperating “sensor/control” wires from power wires.  Not 100% necessary, but good idea to have them seperated due to noise potential of high power wires. CAN /signal prioritization and termination.  There are several different styles of networks or control wiring you can choose.  If going with Daisy-chain CAN , think about prioritizing your runs relative to the robt function priorities.  Most teams most years give moving high priority, and thus it should be structured to have that priority.\n\nWiring management.  Wires can get easily tangled or damaged in matches.  Keeping it constrained, organized, protected can help ensure you have better success and less failures.  Wire “loom” can be useful.  This is especially true if doing moving harnesses like elevators and Arms can require.\n\nStrain Relief.  Most games have vigorous contact and having controllers anchored well with strain relief can help ensure wiring stay intact.\n\nHave good tools.  Proper cutters, wire strippers, crimpers… they can make a big difference.\n\nThere are tons more practices, and areas to dig into, but these are some of the big ones.",

Something that has been very helpful for us when designing the electronics for each mechanism is to start thinking about how you’re going to manage the cables from the design stage. It’s going to help a lot to make slots to mount cable ties or channels to pass the cables through. You could use bases for zip ties, but you run the risk of them coming loose. Slots make cable management easier and make it easier for everyone to know where the cables go. image 1411×744 97.3 KB screenshot from 604’s robot cad\n\nimage 1411×744 97.3 KB\n\nimage 1411×744 97.3 KB",
