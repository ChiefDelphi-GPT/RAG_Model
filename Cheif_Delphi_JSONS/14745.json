Currently sitting at 15 minutes+ and this killed us at a recent competition.  We had a couple of bugs in our auto routines and just didn’t have enough time to build, push and test code.\n\nI’ve searched Chief Delphi and found a few thing things that might help reduce this time but I wanted to get the opinions of the CD community before we attack our code.\n\nThis is our first year on C++ and a complete new set of coding students, so each commands and command groups were written long hand.  IE A separate file and class definition for every command and command group. That gave us a total of 83 headers and 83 cpp’s in the project.  Am I correct in assuming this is a major cause of our large build times.  I saw one thread that said each file contributes ~3 second to the total time, so this could explain 166 x 3 sec = 8.3 minutes. I also read that choosing deploy rather than build will half the times as the debug exe isn’t compiled/linked when deploying. (wishing we had found this one before the competition) I also read that choosing some offline option in gradle will also help build times. So my questions are\n\nDo we to need to move away from the one file for each command approach to a one line approach where commands are defined as lambda in the button binding?\n\nShould we also build our command groups in the button bindings in that one liner style?\n\nHow do we modify gradle permanently so that is doesn’t build a debug exe as we are not using the debug feature?\n\nWhat file do we modify to add the “offline” option to gradle that apparently helps build times?\n\nThere was also something about desktop support, how do we check/ modify this setting to reduce build times?\n\nOrder what should be prioritised specification wise if we were to purchase a new laptop to help with build times?\n\nCPU type, speed, cores\n\nRAM\n\nGPU (I don’t think this has anything to do with build times, but I thought i ask the question just in case)\n\nHard Drive type eg SSD\n\nGetting corporate Antivirus setting changed to exclude source folders for FRC projects. Thanks in advance for any recommendations given. Regards Warren",

The next build took 2 minutes.  My 8 core desktop that’s 6 months old built it in 1.5 minutes. It did use all 8 cores (16 threads) while building.

For example, one thing that rookie programmers sometimes do is add more includes that are needed which increases build times. You could use a tool like https://include-what-you-use.org/ to help find those instances.\n\nwarren.reynolds1:\n\nWhat file do we modify to add the “offline” option to gradle that apparently helps build times?\n\nI wouldn’t really expect this to make that much of a savings\n\nWPILib: Change Run Commands Except Deploy/Debug in Offline Mode Setting - Change whether GradleRIO is running in Online Mode for commands other then deploy/debug (will attempt to automatically pull dependencies from online).

Enable this for test and simulation purposes. This defaults to Desktop Support off.\n\nwarren.reynolds1:\n\nOrder what should be prioritised specification wise if we were to purchase a new laptop to help with build times?\n\nSSD is a must.

Ultimately, I figured out how to use ccache ( https://ccache.dev/ ) along with gradle on both Windows and Linux and made some scripts to reconfigure machines to take advantage of it. They are out of date now, but if you want to try to resurrect them you can find them on Bitbucket In 2021 we switched to Java and have been enjoying builds that take 5 seconds – we try out a lot more ideas in actual code now!",
