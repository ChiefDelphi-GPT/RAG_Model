We are programming in java, and we are using Kraken motors with Talon FX controllers, CANCoders, pigeon 2 gyro, and Canivore so we could use the Phoenix Tuner X swerve code generator.  However, I am concerned that it has a different API and will be “out of the box” code which could lead us to less understanding of the code and less options/flexibility/examples/success when it comes to creating code for autonomous routines.  We have already started learning about java coding for swerve via WPILib information and by watching the Zero to Autonomous video #6 (with accompanying swerve drive code), as well as reviewing the AdvantageKit swerve drive code. At this point  I am inclined to go with trying to implement the AdvantageKit swerve drive code rather than starting with the Tuner X Swerve code.  By the way, far in the past we had tried the CTRE Motion Magic for autonomous without much luck. Any advice here would be greatly appreciated.",

If you feel your team could benefit from more advanced logging features like Log Replay , AdvantageKit is a good path for your team to take.\n\nI’m not too familiar with the Tuner X Swerve Generator, however, from their documentation, it seems to be very straightforward with a clear and well documented step by step process.\n\nIf I were in your position, I would use the Tuner X Swerve Generator as a starting point, and if you feel that it is difficult to understand/use, look at using something else such as AdvantageKit or a custom swerve base.",

I don’t know that one starting point or another will make the difference for you so much as knowing how to use the suite of tools to start with something working, make incremental changes, and all the while being able to observe/debug them using the excellent simulation tools.\n\nThere is then one additional step to bridge from the simulated world to the real world (in terms of CANCoder offset calibration, basic CAN wiring/motor control, gyro integration, etc.) but I found that part to all be “just a simple, if annoying, set of tasks,” but nothing that was conceptually challenging.\n\nYou have enough time (calendar time, anyway) that you can try multiple starting points and see which one(s) resonate the best with your team of coders. You might even consider a starting point of another team’s published code that is using the same hardware as you’ve chosen.

I just took a look at YAGSL for the first time and their style seems more similar to the WPILib. (YAGSL does say to use the CTRE swerve for your equipment.)\n\nIs that CTRE style of coding what concerns you or do you think the calculations in the library classes are solving different problems than the WPILib or YAGSL?\n\nThey all seemed rather similar to me as they are all solving the same robot movement problem but each has a little different flavor of expressing features, options and embellishments. All should connect to PathPlanner about the same.",

When I reviewed YAGSL, WPILib swerve code examples,  and code associated with AdvantageKit, I could follow and understand the code. When I look at the CTRE SwerveDriveExample code, I cannot follow the much of the code.  All of this is new to me, but I reviewed WPILib information on kinematics and odometry, watched the Zero To Autonomous video #6 on Swerve Drive (and reviewed the associated code), and was able to follow that code.   I am concerned I will not be able to troubleshoot the CTRE Tuner X code because I don’t have a good understanding of it.\n\nIf it’s easy to create the Tuner X code, we can try that first, but I think using the AdvantageKit code (or YAGSL or other similar code) that is written in the usual command-based format using the java classes that were in the tutorials may lead to more success.",

Our repo is here:\n\n2024PostSeason\n\nContribute to FRC999/2024Competition development by creating an account on GitHub.\n\nWe treat our code as educational tool, so we actually used Phoenix 5 (well, because we did not know whether we will get the motors that support Phoenix 6). So, the code is reasonably well documented.\n\nYou can also look at our “teaching code” we developed last summer -\n\nContribute to FRC999/2024Swerve development by creating an account on GitHub.\n\nthis code has pass-through classes for motors and IMU, so like YAGSL, it is compatible with pretty much any hardware, you just need to configure it. We’re also using Java. Note that Krakens only support Phoenix 6, so your motor code would need to be adjusted a bit, should you decide to use our code as an example. We’re currently refactoring our code to Phoenix 6. So, will have a functional one within a few weeks.",

It was very simple.\n\nSummer is a great time to nudge your students towards deeper understanding of control topics.",

I don’t remember what they all were. Understanding the library did take some time but we were able to plug it into our normal command/subsystem structure. However, this meant that we stopped getting automatic updates from CTRE for their swerve library and this caused us to have to discover some issues.\n\nGoing forward we are planning to use the CTRE library directly and figure out ways to patch on top of it for any specific features we need.\n\nOur 2024 code is linked below, I’m not saying it’s a good example of what to do, just that it’s possible to use the CTRE code without using their full template.\n\nSpectrum's 2024 Competition Software.

Getting the configuration correct is really what you are getting with Tuner X.\n\nWhile you can learn a lot troubleshooting configuration…. It is also can be a big turn off…. Especially because some changes survive code deploys/restarts but not power cycles, etc.\n\nIMHO, if they are coding they are learning whether they are in the guts of a swerve library or using a COTS library.  In really life developers utilize a lot of provided libraries too… so I feel zero guilt about using them.",

So, the logic of the code stays the same.\n\nWe’re now working on adopting the native code that is auto-generated by CTR Phoenix Tuner X. That code is native (in a sense that it’s based directly on the CTR libraries), and already uses voltage-based driving and velocity PID . And it’s much-much shorter. So, it looks very promising for the next season. We literally were able to get teleop driving working in 30 minutes from the beginning. We will be converting it to the PRO, though, as we really like the hardware PID and a possibility of the 1kHz update cycle on the turn motor sensors.",

The wiring looks fine.  Bus utilization is low on the driver station.  We have also checked that we have loaded Pheonix 6 on all of the motors and encoders and the gyro.\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas?\n\nAlso, we are hoping there might be a mentor nearby who would be willing to meet with us (in or near Old Lyme CT) to help get swerve drive started.\n\nThanks!",
