Generally they are the end points of a mechanism (ie. top and bottom of an elevator). A soft limit is a limit enforced through software. With the elevator example, it would mean having say 2\" above your lowest mechanical point and 2\" below your top point be your soft stops. The elevator drives with a much lower speed in these regions (can’t be zero because if you overshoot into that region you wouldn’t be able to move out). This would need to be placed on top of any control loop you have to soften the blow from an overshooting PID .",

For example, googling “how to implement pid frc” gives at least 6 really good resources.\n\nI will give a few more resources that will probably help though.\n\nFirst, WPILib example projects are really helpful, just go to your WPILib VSCode installation, open the command palette (ctrl + shift + p), go to WPILib: Create a new project. Select example, your language of choice, then choose the example you want to look at.\n\nThe FRC 0 to Autonomous YouTube channel covers a lot of useful information as well.\n\nFinally, to echo what @vargoose84 said, don’t worry about knowing everything there is to know about FRC programming.

I know REV especially has a lot of good example projects for how to do things with the SparkMAX over CAN .\n\nFind code from other teams in GitHub, and check out what/how they are doing things\n\nFind code from other teams in GitHub, and check out what/how they are doing things\n\nSammyPants:\n\nWhere would I find out how a specific thing of code works so that I understand that for teaching?\n\nSee above for where to learn about the things.\n\nAs for understanding the code you are reading, the more familiar and comfortable you get at programming and problem solving, the easier it gets to read and understand another’s code, making assumptions about library and function/method calls based on names and such, until you can go back and make sure those calls do what you assumed they did.\n\nSammyPants:\n\nWhat would the best way to teach new people java be?\n\nThis has been the question I have been working on answering for the last 10+ years. I do not have a good answer, especially because I am not a good teacher. Specifically I am not good at presenting loads of information in a format that makes it easier to understand. I can however explain concepts and answer specific questions. So for 3468, its mostly come down to, those who are self-motivated will spend the time on their own figuring things out and asking questions, and the rest will either limp along until enough sinks in, or leave the programming department. I wish I could increase the retention of our rookie members, but sadly as a Mentor, I just do not have the time or resources to do so.\n\nSammyPants:\n\nWhen does can bus overloading happen? (I’ve only heard of this) and how do I fix it if I run into it?\n\nDevices on a CAN Bus take turns sending and receiving data. When you are sending so much data that not everything can be transmitted in a timely manner, you are saturating the bus. You can also negatively impact this phenomenon if your bus isn’t properly biased (missing the terminating resistors), is extremely long, or has long extensions off the “main bus” that can introduce signal reflections which slows how quickly data can be sent because extra effort is spent understanding the data.\n\nPhysically, making sure your CAN Bus is properly terminated, is as short as is reasonable, and any stubs/extensions off the main bus are as short as possible can all improve the overall performance of the bus. In Software, limiting the amount of CAN Data send can alleviate an overload. Common examples include sending the same setpoint over and over every loop, or reading sensor data every loop. Slowing those actions down can greatly reduce the load on the Bus.\n\nSammyPants:\n\nFor button board programming, do I make an arduino act as a controller or does wpilib have something for that?\n\nThere are several ways this can be done. The way I’ve always done is using a Library like GitHub - MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary at version-2.0 to make an Arduino emulate a HID Joystick with code like this from 3468’s 2020 code InfiniteRecharge/arduino_gamepad/InfiniteRechargeOperatorConsoleGamepad/InfiniteRechargeOperatorConsoleGamepad.ino at master · frc3468/InfiniteRecharge · GitHub\n\nJust make sure you are using the correct type of Arduino for the Library. Usually you need one of the ATMega32U4 based board like the Leonardo or Pro Micro.\n\nSammyPants:\n\nI a setpoint for a motor just PID in disguise?\n\nPID /F is just a control loop system for attempting to reach a setpoint. There are other algorithms that attempt the same thing such as bang-bang. The term “setpoint” is independent of PID , though within FRC , I’ve only once seen anyone using any control loop mechanism that wasn’t PID or Bang-Bang. If you are talking about giving a motor a setpoint over CAN , then generally in that case you are using a PID Controller that is running on the Motor Controller itself, refer to the docs for the relevant Motor Controller.\n\nSammyPants:\n\nWhat’s a good way to split up work in a division?\n\nI assume you mean splitting up the coding work? A Kanban board can be a good way to split up tasks for the robot/code and keep each person working on one thing at a time. Think like a bunch of sticky notes, one for each task, with columns for TODO, IN PROGRESS, and DONE that you move the sticky notes between as they are worked.\n\nSammyPants:\n\nWhere could I find a programming mentor?\n\nThis tends to be very difficult unless you happen to have the parent of a member who is a programmer. You could try reaching out to any local companies that you know would do some amount of programming and ask them if they’d ask if any of their employees would be interested.\n\nI have been the sole Programming Mentor in Northeast Louisiana for the last 9 years, which at one point consisted of 5 teams, of which I tried to help all as much as I could. This is the first year I have a second Programming Mentor on 3468, but I am also working equally with another Rookie team in the region, and she will be moving out of state after this year. After which point, we’ll be back to one. I’ve tried inviting and even guilting co-workers and friends into joining, but most just aren’t interested either because they don’t want to work with kids, or they don’t want to put in the time investment.",

You can use a lot more help than can be expected from this forum. You need a mentor and both you and the mentor should start reading, at least skimming, the WPILib/ FRC from 0 to robot documentation as suggested.\n\nThis is where you get mentors: Ecolab/Caztek Engineering/BigR Stores/Leidos/MetroSpec/Cray/LCS Company/BW Systems/Vic & Mary Holec/Diesel Dogs/ICS Consulting & Henry Sibley High School\n\nI assume some or all are located near you and could help in-person. Take your list of questions and practiced speech of what you are asking for to whomever sponsored you. I’ve seen monetary sponsors step up to help teams that are struggling with lack of expertise.\n\nI recognize one of the sponsor’s name as one of the most famous super performance computer companies. Maybe they are related and still can help you with control engineering and programming.\n\nMaybe Caztek Engineering, for example or another sponsor, would spend 4 hours with you one day soon and go over your questions and what’s presented in the WPILib/ FRC documentation. Maybe one will even mentor your team for the build season.\n\nSammyPants:\n\nHow does soft limits work? I was able to fumble though making them work but I don’t understand it.\n\nThis was answered herein but I’ll use it as an illustration. Fumbling through and making them work is how I do most of the robotics learning. My team has a couple of plastic tubs with basic components of roboRIO, radio, VRM , motor controllers, camera, gyro, PDP , relay, potentiometer, limit switch, power supply, pneumatics controller sometimes. We do a lot of “experimentation” by writing a line of code and seeing it work or respond to the electromechanical components.\n\nYou say. “I fumbled and got something to work” - that’s at least 99% of the process. A few more seconds of explanation and you’ve completed that lesson.\n\nI and others, I’m sure, would be happy to help you more but I can’t figure out how to interact with students remotely and maintain the Youth Protection Program guidelines. Another significant problem is we’re starting from 0 rather late as have some other teams that have posted on CD recently. I have my team meetings starting tomorrow and that will certainly conflict with your team meetings. But again, 4 hours with an expert can go a long way to helping you understand.\n\nGood Luck this season. You’ve made a great first step in defining your needs and asking for help. A budding engineering manager for sure!",

I don’t know anything about those organizations except Cray is famous but likely now nothing like the Cray of yesteryear. I did Google Caztek Engineering and it looks like a small company that is willing to get into anything. Teachers are a great resource - they already know the material, the students, and how to teach!\n\nIf the answering posts here still leave you with some open questions, I suggest listing your questions in your priority order and maybe we all can pick off a few more of them soon enough for you.\n\nI know someone suggested taking a break from this until kick off but I’ll point out to any highly motivated student that spending 2 or 3 4-hour days reading the WPILib documentation will get you very immersed into the subject matter and especially when you can then try out some code on a roboRIO or old robot.\n\nMy team’s software group knows very little and needs all the programming practice they can get, however, I suggest the priority for the whole team including software is everybody works on the game analyses, design ideas, prototypes, etc., the first week.  The software team has good ideas to contribute and can help design the robot and strategy. If you don’t have a robot to compete with you won’t need the software team.",

Although I think that once you get into the actual game your programming questions will be less hypothetical and more applicable to the robot you want to build.

Sorry, the long thread chockful of great suggestions has not been edited. https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/how-to-ask-questions-about-programming/415365\n\n@vargoose84 prompted this edit: When it first came out I tried the Mentor Network. It didn’t work out well for me for a few reasons. Others have had some success. (Very few interested in remote help and none locally; only serious request of me expected to violate YPP guidelines to provide remote help directly to one student; terrible message management system that didn’t notify you if there was a message on their private system (no interface at all to email, etc.)\n\nThere is also the Senior Mentor Program . Their mission doesn’t seem to precisely fit the situation but I’m for asking anyone for help and you might get some valuable hints on how to proceed.",

Again this is more of I want to understand how something works instead of how to make something work.",
