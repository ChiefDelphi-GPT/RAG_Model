It discusses implementing these loops on different types of motor controllers, like swerve drives versus elevators, arms, or linear motion systems. The conversation also touches on whether to use code running on the RoboRIO or leverage existing motor controller features for managing these loops, and considers past experiences with on-controller vs off-controller approaches. The broader aim is to gather insights from the community to inform decisions about motor ecosystem development.",

Our offseason experience with Motion Magic was significantly better than Smart Motion. We preferred running control loops on the motor because it is faster and avoids overshoots caused by loop overruns. CTRE's fused absolute encoder mode performed exceptionally well on our pivot mechanism and was straightforward to set up. In my opinion, Phoenix Tuner offers a more user-friendly experience compared to the Rev Hardware Client. If you're considering a switch, I recommend it, though it wouldn't magically enhance your performance; we could have achieved similar results using Rev motors instead. The overall experience was notably improved with CTRE.",

It operates at 1 kHz with low latency, ensuring smooth control and aggressive tuning capabilities. The Motion Magic control simplifies motion profiling with trapezoidal or exponential profiles and is straightforward to set up. Additionally, you can tune PID, FF, and motion constraints on the spot with no code needed using Phoenix Tuner X. FusedCANNoder is equally impressive, functioning almost magically. For swerve applications, the CTR swerve library proves highly effective, replicating the same control inputs beneath the hood. As for REV systems, I’m unsure and find them unhelpful; hopefully, their library will improve soon.",

For the swerve, we used the default CTRE feedforward controller, which uses the constants Ks, Kv, and Ka. For our elevator and arm, we employ a custom feedforward algorithm that runs on the RoboRIO, along with a custom profile controller and CTRE motion magic FOC. This custom algorithm enables us to perform more complex calculations, such as how the motion of one subsystem affects the feedforward value of another.",

I don’t personally give two farts about what features vendors toss into their boxes. They’re nice and all, but I value a low-latency voltage control or current control far more than full in-motor motion control. I know how my robot works, the motor doesn’t. That’s not to say these things don’t have some usage. But if you’re looking for top performance, you need something customizable - not canned.",

But if you’re looking for top performance, you need something customizable—not canned.  \n\nI think I disagree on this. Look through the codebases of some of the top teams. A lot of them are running Motion Magic with the CTRE provided feedforward. For really complex systems with multiple degrees of freedom and nonlinear behavior, more custom control can make sense. It worked well for teams like 6328 and 6036 in 2023, who did some advanced modeling with CasADi, but such complexity is rare. Most high-level teams hit elite performance without that level of complexity. Canned doesn’t mean low performance. It’s all about how you use the tools. A simple control scheme that works lets you spend time on things that actually improve your performance, instead of chasing 1 percent improvements that probably don’t matter in a match.",

My opinion (definitely not theory) is only that pure onboard control logic will eventually be outperformed by custom-designed feed forward… but whether that tipping point is before or after the “turn L’s into W’s” point is very questionable to me.\n\nThis is exactly the gain set I would have hoped for for a feedforward model that covers 99.9% of FIRST Robotics Competition situations.",
