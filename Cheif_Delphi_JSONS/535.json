                    "cooked": "I know this isn’t a one-size-fits-all answer but I’m looking at a few discussions about motion control and future planning and wanted to see what the collective wisdom of the community coalesced around.\n\nSplitting this question into at least 2 parts, one for drive trains (specifically swerve drive), and one for other manipulators (elevators, arms, linear motion, etc) I have a question.\n\nSpecifically for teams using feedback-based control loops (eg PID control in some form - set your motor to a set point (angular or distance, etc)), how do you implement those loops and controls? Also, I know this is likely to change based on if we’re controlling a drive train (swerve drive specifically) or another manipulator (eg elevator, arm, etc).\n\nDo you use code running on the RoboRIO to manage your PID , sensors, and control loops, or do you utilize the control loops built into most of the motor controllers to manage, and why?\n\nThe background:\n\nMy team is looking into moving motor ecosystems next year. Part of that discussion is what we need/want/will-use in motor controller features. We’ve had some… colorful… results with the REV on-controller motion control in the past, and as we look to likely change going forward, is this something we should revisit, or take one of our programming mentors thoughts of “never ever on-controller”.\n\nSo we’re looking for the community’s thoughts and experiences with on and off-controller motion control and what worked for you so that we can make an informed decision in the off-season. Hopefully before tariffs send prices to the moon.",

Our offseason experience with Motion Magic was way better than Smart Motion. We prefer running control loops on the motor because it’s faster and avoids any overshoots due to loop overruns. CTRE ’s fused absolute encoder mode worked great on our pivot and was super easy to setup, and IMO Phoenix Tuner is much nicer to use than the Rev Hardware Client. If you’re thinking of switching, I’d go for it. But it won’t make you suddenly better, we could have achieved all the same things this season if we had used Rev motors instead. The experience was just a lot better with CTRE .",

It has full feedfoward support (kS, kV, kA, kG) with support for both cosine gravity feedforward (for arms) and static gravity feedforward (for elevators), it has very low latency and the loop runs at 1khz on the talon, which results in smoother control and the ability to tune it more aggressively. The Motion Magic control allows for super easy motion profiling (trapezoidal or exponential) and is trivial to implement. Also, you can fully tune the PID , FF, and motion constraints on-the-fly with zero code using Phoenix Tuner X. FusedCANCoder is also very nice and works like magic. For swerve, I used the CTR swerve library which uses the exact same control requests under the hood and is very powerful. For REV stuff, I have no idea and am of no use. I hope their library gets an overhaul sometime.",

For our elevator and arm, we employ a custom feedforward algorithm that runs on the RoboRIO, in addition to using both a custom profile controller and the CTRE motion magic FOC . This custom algorithm allows us to perform more complex calculations, such as how the motion of one subsystem can affect the feedforward value of another.",

For non-motion-profiled subsystems, we do PID on the spark because it works and keeps the code simpler.\n\nFor swerve turning, we run a PID on the rio because it’s easier to connect abs encoders to there than to the spark (which requires a breakout board and stuff).  We only run feedforward on the driving motors (is this bad? our robot doesn’t follow paths very well, and I suspect this may be part of the issue).",

In season you should be using whatever is the easiest and most performant (which most of the time is outboard control w/ MotionMagic), and students should understand how they work under the hood from good off season preparation. Of course there are cases where you can’t and need to fall back to on-RIO control.\n\nWith how fast modern mechanisms move, it’s much safer to do outboard control so any RIO loop overruns don’t destroy your mechanism.",

But if you’re looking for top performance, you need something customizable - not canned.\n\nI think I disagree on this. Look through the codebases of some of the top teams. A lot of them are running Motion Magic with the CTRE provided feedforwards. For really complex systems with multiple degrees of freedom and nonlinear behavior, more custom control can make sense. It worked well for teams like 6328 and 6036 in 2023, who did some advanced modeling with CasADi, but such complexity is rare. Most high-level teams hit elite performance without that level of complexity. Canned doesn’t mean low performance. It’s all about how you use the tools. A simple control scheme that works lets you spend time on things that actually improve your performance, instead of chasing 1 percent improvements that probably don’t matter in a match.",

We’ve never used Motion Magic or CTRE ’s on-controller feedforward in competition even after switching to their ecosystem on our primary robots in 2024.\n\nThis approach has worked exceptionally well for us because it takes advantage of how each platform works best: feedback controllers benefit from a faster update rate, but profiles and feedforward benefit from higher levels of customization (especially useful when we’re frequently dealing with complex transitions between control modes or alternative FF/profile models that would be difficult or impossible to implement with vendor libraries). We’ve never found any mechanism where running a feedforward or profile faster than 50Hz makes a measurable performance difference, so there’s no point in making more work for ourselves by restricting our options unnecessarily. That applies to hardware too, since this approach means we aren’t locked to using CTRE ’s products on our development robot.",

My opinion (definitely not theory ) is only that pure onboard control logic will eventually be outperformed by custom-designed feed forward… but whether that tipping point is before or after the “turn L’s into W’s” point is very questionable to me.\n\nThat being said, I took some time to rip back through docs, since my memory and biases on this are at least a few years old.\n\nWe’ve historically been a REV ecosystem team, at least in the 2017-2025 range. Here’s really the crux of where my opinion comes from:\n\nimage 1098×523 50.1 KB\n\nimage 1098×523 50.1 KB\n\nimage 1098×523 50.1 KB\n\nA lot of the onboard features I recall were kinda like this - Worked ok, but ultimately “write some code yourself” was the way around the limits of performance the onboard control algorithm imposed.\n\nAnd, personal bias: I’m one of those people who bristles at being “sold” on things… Brand names involving “Smart” or “Magic” are the fast track to get me to distrust the thing without even looking at it. Again, that’s a personal bias (limit, if I’m being honest).\n\nBut, looking this morning at CTRE ’s docs, I think I gotta backpedal my opinion a bit more. My opinion was not informed by 2025’s reality.\n\nimage 1188×571 62 KB\n\nimage 1188×571 62 KB\n\nimage 1188×571 62 KB\n\nThis is exactly the gain set I would have hoped for for a feedforward model that covers 99.9% of FRC situations.\n\nLesson learned on my end to do some research before expressing an opinion.
