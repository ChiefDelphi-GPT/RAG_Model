They added commands to the Sequential Command Group on the initialize method to be able to change the command group with relation the some conditionals.\n\nI guess this is easier than creating all possible combinations of command groups and running them on a conditional command. However, it seems like this implantation will cause some issues on the Scheduler side. As far as I understand at first this will prevent subsystem requirements to be defined since they are read before the initialize is called.\n\nWhat other problems could this implementation cause and also what other methods can be used to create a similar code structure?",

                    "cooked": "When I first looked at the code you posted, I was a bit surprised that the addCommands calls in initialize were not throwing exceptions about adding commands to a running sequence. So, I took a look at the addCommands implementation in SequentialCommandGroup and saw that it could work.\n\nTake a look at SequentialCommandGroup.addCommands and bring up a call hierarchy on m_currentCommandIndex. In particular, take a look at its initialization, and its usages in addCommands and initialize. The addCommands method will not start throwing exceptions until after SequentialCommandGroup.initialize is called which the posted code does not call until after adding commands.\n\nOne thing I would definitly change in this code would be to move super.initialize outside the if block so that it would be called everytime and not just the first time. They have gotten away with this since an auto routine is typically only scheduled once per match. Making this change could make repeated testing in your lab easier.\n\nI have to wonder if the wpilib team really intended for this sort of thing to work. It seems to be a rather dangerous thing to do. Think of a teleop command that will get initialized multiple times during a match. The posted code would only add the commands once (but have initialization issues for all but the first time without my suggested change). I could see less experienced programmers getting into serious trouble with this pattern.",
