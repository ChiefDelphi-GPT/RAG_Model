This can be about the library itself, tools, or documentation.\n\nI like to structure this kind of feedback ask as looking for the good, the bad, and the ugly:\n\nThe good: What worked well? What did you find particularly beneficial to your team? What would you like to see more of?\n\nThe bad: What didn’t work? What did you struggle with? What would you like to see changed?\n\nThe ugly: What did you have to hack around to make it work for you? What made figuring out the right solution more difficult for you (e.g. wasted precious time)?\n\nWe’re currently working on our plans/priorities for next year.  Suggestions are certainly welcome, but I’ll note that since WPILib is a volunteer effort / community project, the best way to see a feature get implemented is to implement it yourself, or get someone in the community interested in implementing it. We welcome both ideas and contributors!",

It would be nice to see x drive, butterfly drive, and more get wider support it’s unfortunate to see software be the limit for teams trying new solutions.\n\nalso like if anyone could help translating H-Drive support to cpp would be fantastic",

I especially like the new trigger bindings introduced this season. The level of tech support is great (always very responsive and masterful).\n\nThe bad: What didn’t work? What did you struggle with? What would you like to see changed?\n\nThe documentation always trails the implementation a bit.\n\nThe ugly: What did you have to hack around to make it work for you? What made figuring out the right solution more difficult for you (e.g. wasted precious time)?\n\nShuffleboard needs some love.

I want to love it so much, but it just has so many warts. There were many times we had to restart it because the UI elements wouldn’t show current data and other issues. It is a bit of a resource hog and still gets hung up at times. I suppose I should give it credit as a really strong tool as we still continue to use it even with all of these issues.\n\nThe Ugly: Holonomic trajectory generation and following. The HolonomicDriveController is awesome. We were able to switch from a fused heading RamseteController implementation to one using HolonomicDriveController without much trouble, but we weren’t able to use the holonomic facing information that our trajectory generation tool, PathPlanner, produced…so we had to hack around a bit to get some heading change we wanted in our trajectories to work.",

Maybe I’m missing something, but it would be nice to have those rules spelled out more explicitly in the docs. All in all, the Command based framework was very helpful for our programming and something I would recommend.\n\nLike many others, we did experience some problems with Shuffleboard, typically stemming from having it be open too long. Restarting the tool normally fixed those, though. In the future, I would like there to be a very easy way to schedule commands from Shuffleboard - the example of simply putting the Command on SmartDashboard failed (although admittedly I was coding under high time pressure in less than ideal conditions [lunch during DCMP] and have not returned to the original idea) but it would be a very nice thing to have in the future (e.g. one could be tuning parts of autonomous routines multiple times in a practice match or bind very specialized commands to the dashboard to avoid accidentally triggering them).",

In 2020, we added separate classes for each drivetrain because there weren’t that many combinations, but it’ll become unmaintainable if we add more.\n\nWe currently have to modify six nearly identical classes any time we need to fix a bug in or add a feature to pose estimation (3 drivetrain types x 2 languages). Each new drivetrain type adds two new kinematics classes, two new odometry classes, and two new pose estimator classes.\n\nvarun123:\n\nPose3d’s exp and log functions are really slow.

This probably stems from the dozens of allocations (I counted 23) that this method calls and the number of times that we call them\n\nInteresting. We may have to call the C++ version via JNI, since we don’t have much control over what EJML does internally for allocations, and making a bunch of geometry member variables to reuse for the calculation would bloat the size of what’s supposed to be a cheap-to-copy type.\n\nvarun123:\n\nIt wasn’t clear to me that kinematics classes aren’t thread safe\n\nNone of our classes are thread-safe.

We didn’t understand this aspect of robot programming for many months. To be fair, it never bit us with WPIlib (but oh boy did an async initialization gotcha in the navX API bite us).\n\nThe ugly: The number of footguns related to unit conversions is epic. It should not be easy to, for example, combine APIs which deal in encoder ticks per 100ms versus meters per second. One might argue that this provides good exercise for students, but IMO it instead teaches dangerous API design. Critically, angle measurement is variously in degrees (clockwise/counterclockwise) or radians, and 0 is variously in the direction of the positive x axis or the positive y axis. In some cases degrees vs radians is abstracted, but this inconsistency helps obscure whether there’s even a consistent direction of positive rotation. These coordinate/angle ambiguities added many hours to our initial swerve drive bring-up. Regarding coordinate/rotation transformations, we may have overlooked something, but we never found a way to mirror axes, and we had to go to a lot of trouble developing workarounds that didn’t compose with WPIlib APIs. Finally, we went way down the path of using TrajectoryGenerator before appreciating how brittle it is in the context of swerve drive; working around the problems was a lot of trouble, and the results were never more than passable. I think most teams use PathPlanner, but we didn’t know that and fell into what felt like a trap in retrospect.\n\nThe ugly: The number of footguns related to unit conversions is epic.

A lot of these frustrations felt like typical remote debugging with an incomplete developer toolchain, but attempts at workarounds, such as using NetworkTables , quickly added enough overhead to cause loop overruns, so we did a lot of black-box debugging by necessity. Maybe there’s some existing documentation that could help; if not I’d love to see some improvements here in documentation and/or tooling.",

Don’t know exactly what is causing the crash or if it’s even because of WPILib.\n\nWe think it’s mostly because of Java 17 and the current GC settings.  These almost certainly need some tuning/testing as @varun123 ’s post discusses.  We may end up needing to have different GC settings for Rio1 and Rio2 due to memory and processor speed differences.  We also need to do a bit more tuning of some of the native memory allocations–we have memory pools (to reduce allocation churn) in a few areas that result in “holding onto” memory after the peak demand has passed, these need some tuning as well to release memory back to the system after some period of time.\n\nvarun123:\n\nI would love mutable versions of the translation classes so we’re not required to create dozens of objects when doing transformations on them.\n\nThis was an intentional design decision.  You’re right that it increases GC pressure, but immutable objects are much easier to reason about and avoid footguns.\n\nj.e:\n\nattempts at workarounds, such as using NetworkTables , quickly added enough overhead to cause loop overruns, so we did a lot of black-box debugging by necessity\n\nIt’s worth noting that data logs are lower overhead than NT (NT has to do more work).  Several teams I talked to added their own switching between data logs and NT, we want to make this easier to do in a more unified fashion (or better yet, just speed up NT for the common case).",

It should not be easy to, for example, combine APIs which deal in encoder ticks per 100ms versus meters per second. One might argue that this provides good exercise for students, but IMO it instead teaches dangerous API design.\n\nI agree. At least Phoenix Pro moved to SI units. WPILib is already pretty loud with unit suffixes in Java, so there’s not much more we can do until Java gets value types that don’t incur a bunch of GC overhead. C++'s units system solves this problem in a zero-overhead way.\n\nj.e:\n\nRegarding coordinate/rotation transformations, we may have overlooked something, but we never found a way to mirror axes, and we had to go to a lot of trouble developing workarounds that didn’t compose with WPIlib APIs.\n\nThe CoordinateSystem class only handles transformations between coordinate systems with the same handedness (right or left) because they are pure rotations. Mirroring an axis switches handedness and can’t be represented with 3D rotations alone.\n\nWe’ve considered adding support for converting between left-handed and right-handed coordinate systems, but I don’t think that would help you since I assume what you’re doing is mirroring an axis and still treating it as North-West-Up convention to deal with the field assymetry.\n\nj.e:\n\nFinally, we went way down the path of using TrajectoryGenerator before appreciating how brittle it is in the context of swerve drive\n\nWPILib’s TrajectoryGenerator and PathWeaver UI were written in 2020 for differential drives only, before swerve became a huge thing. Assuming we don’t replace it, we should document that better. We’re considering replacements like:\n\nPathPlanner\n\nIf we do adopt it, we’ll need to do some API reviews/refactors so it integrates better with the main library.\n\nHelixNavigator\n\nThis is swerve-only.\n\nWIP replacment for HelixNavigator\n\nThis will eventually support swerve and diff drive. Since it’s based on React, we need to interface with a native CasADi backend or a Wasm Sleipnir backend. The latter backend is much faster, but is much less stable.",
