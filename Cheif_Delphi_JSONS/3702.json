I’ve been learning day by day over the past month and we have a fully operating chassis that drives (using the Kraken x60 in a CAN network) and we have an elevator now that we just put on yesterday. We had no encoders (only CIM motors) but were lucky enough to stumble upon  one REV NEO motor which has a built in encoder. I downloaded the rev library and configured the motor controller. I added it to our current CAN network, which hopefully it doesn’t matter that we are using Kraken motors and a REV in the same network. The issue was I wasn’t able to actually get the motor running. Now, that may have been because over half the day I had a faulty motor controller and thought my code was the problem but I tried reuploading the code after changing to a working motor controller and I wasn’t getting feedback. I used a template to start out which I found here, and I also heard that REV has updated its library this year. So it’s no longer CANSparkMax. I think now it’s just SparkMax when you code. I really don’t know where to start, and I haven’t actually had to code an encoder yet so if anyone has advice that would be great. I made a subclass called Elevator.java and did all the coding with the template someone posted on a forum and made adjustments too. I had Copilot help out some but it isn’t using the new updated library so it really wasn’t much help. Then in Robot.java I tried having the elevator go up certain heights as specified in the Elevator.java. I had no errors but it wouldn’t actually execute anything. I’ve just never delt with REV motors/Encoders before. I can easily tap into the PWM with other motors but never have had to use motors where I need to go into our CAN network and use encoders. I have competition in a few days and the pressure is on if you can’t already tell. Let me know if you need the Robot.java file\n\nHere’s the elevator subclass I had",
