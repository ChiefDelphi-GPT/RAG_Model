Code we’re using for the swerve is based on code from GitHub - frc3512/SwerveBot-2022: The source code for the 2022 FRC postseason swerve drive robot. and GitHub - Team364/BaseFalconSwerve .\n\nWe have two main issues at this point:\n\nIn teleop, doing repeated back and forth runs tends to rotate and eventually move diagonally ( video , don’t mind the parts where the driver corrects with sideways movements)\n\nIn auto, the robot sometimes does this weird but subtle stairstep diagonal movement ( video 1 , video 2 ). Also, the auto is meant to travel 1 meter but instead goes more like 2 meters (the blue tape squares on the carpet are left over from 2021 and are spaced 30 inches from each other). When I print out the estimated pose I also have gotten numbers all over the place like 0.9, 0.7, or I think even -0.3 (yes, negative 0.3) with it still going about 2 meters.\n\nCode: GitHub - SuperiorRoboworksTeam857/2023SwerveTest: 2023 test of swerve code Robot is NEOs with Spark MAXes over CAN, with SDS MK4i L2, CANCoders, ADIS16470 IMU board\n\nWe’ve been working on this chassis for over a month and have had a hard time with code, especially since the first thing that mostly worked was the (what we now know is unmaintained) SDS example code.",

I don’t know much about the Mk4i, but you see that issue a lot with some high torque front wheel drive cars like the Mazdaspeed 3 .\n\nother things I would check if you guys haven’t already, would be frame rigidity, we had that issue with the snowbots X-Drive a few years back. Also double check tolerances on the modules, there’s a very slight chance a bearing is a smidge loose causing a wheel to drift.\n\nIn auto, it seems to step to the other direction than the drift in tele-op. If you are using a gyro, it might be over correcting for the drift. (I haven’t looked at the code at all, so I’m not too sure).",

But, if that all seems fine, then try enabling tele-op, but staying stationary for ~10 seconds. SDS has code that retrieves the absolute encoder positions if you aren’t moving, which you can see on line 128 here .\n\nWith your second issue, if your pose seems accurate in teleop but not auton, you’re probably double-updating your odometer-- once from your periodic and once from your trajectory follower command. The periodic one passes in 0’s for chassis speeds since you aren’t touching the controller, while the auton one updates it as intended. Rather then updating the odometer in your periodic every time, try adding a condition that checks if you’re in teleop.",
