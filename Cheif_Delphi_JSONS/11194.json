                    "cooked": "The simplest solution is a pid loop, which uses angle measurements to pull the motor towards a setpoint. Here’s the essence of how it works:\n\nYou have three terms (Proportional, Integral, and Derivative). Each term is multiplied by a gain, which are different for every mechanism. The value of each term is based off of the “error”, which is the difference between where the mechanism is, and where it should be.\n\nThe P term is simply the error multiplied by the P gain - as the error gets bigger, the P term gets bigger. This creates a virtual spring, which pulls the mechanism towards the setpoint.\n\nIf the P gain is too high, the momentum of the mechanism will carry it past the setpoint, causing oscillations (like a weight bouncing on a spring). The D gain helps compensate for that by preventing the velocity from getting too high when you approach the setpoint (like a damper). It works by multiplying the D gain by the velocity of your mechanism.\n\nWith this virtual spring and damper, if your mechanism has a constant load on it, it won’t actually reach the setpoint, it will settle at the point where the load is equal to the force of the P gain pushing back. To resolve this last bit of error we use an I term, which just increases towards the setpoint over time. (beware of this, though, because you can end up with something called “integral windup” - if the mechanism takes a long time to reach the setpoint, the I can end up getting much bigger than the power your mechanism can actually output, which will result in huge oscillations)\n\nWith an arm, you will also want something to account for the force of gravity. This is called a feedforward. WPILib includes one for an arm called ArmFeedforward.\n\nThe results of all these terms are just added up and sent to the motor. The gains are usually determined by trial and error - start with all the gains at 0, and slowly increase the P gain till you see oscillations, then add some of the D gain to smooth things out, then if necessary increase the I.\n\nIn practice, there are approximately 1.7 trillion implementations of a PID loop for FRC, so just use one of them - the built in ones are a good place to start. You have two options - the WPILib PID controller, or the Spark Max PID controller. The WPILib pid controller runs on the RIO, and is slightly more complex to implement.  The Spark Max PID controller runs on the motor controller, and is slightly easier, but I don’t know if you can add a gravity feedforward to it for an arm, so it might not work quite as well.\n\nHere are some links to point you in the right direction: Introduction to PID — FIRST Robotics Competition documentation (WPILib’s explanation of PID loops) Controllers — FIRST Robotics Competition documentation (look at the first two, which are how to use WPILib pid loops and feedforwards) SPARK-MAX-Examples/Robot.java at master · REVrobotics/SPARK-MAX-Examples · GitHub (Spark Max example position control code)\n\nMake sure all your units are consistent, and make sure that when you apply a positive output to your motor, the encoders read a positive change in position (the direction is consistent). These two things account for 90% of issues I’ve seen with PID loops.",

If this isc your first time then disconnect any devices that can not spin indefinitely (ie just have a motor and gear box. Out of the box the smartmotion sample uses motor rotation as an input so if you have a 100;1 gear box 100 motor revs = 1 output rev. You can add a scale to the motor to convert to user units if you wish. The great thing about the sample code is it puts all the PIDF baubles on the dashboard so you can tune.  I have observed that when using b the default motor revs as the inputs PIDF values trend very small. P=~.00005 When your comfortable Wyeth the predictable outputs to your inputs (maybe even created some more if button x then setpiont = #) you can connect the robot load. Now comes the tricky part.  With arms specially. You want to use arbitrary feed forward. You should test what is the required percent motor power to hold the arm horizontal.  Then apply this value to the arbff parameter of the setreference() call after adjusting the value to equal the Cosin of the current angle in radion when horizontal =90.\n\nIts alot to try and talk through here. If you set up a test bench ie motor/gearbox your welcome to give me a shout out. I’ll try to zoom  with you. @FRC4226 your couch and possibly you if your are who i believe you are have my contact info.",
