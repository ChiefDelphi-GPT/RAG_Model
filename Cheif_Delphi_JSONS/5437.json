In case you’re unfamiliar, QFRCDashboard is a driver dashboard as an alternative (improvement) to Shuffleboard/SmartDashboard. Compared to Shuffleboard, QFRCDashboard is designed to provide a significantly smoother, less resource hungry, and cleaner overall user experience.\n\nCompetition 906×602 81.5 KB\n\nCompetition 906×602 81.5 KB\n\nCompetition 906×602 81.5 KB\n\nQFRCDashboard was completely rewritten from its old form into QML, rather than Qt Widgets. This has enabled several significant QoL improvements that were impossible in the old version.\n\nQFRCDashboard’s UI has been completely redesigned to be more modern, bubbly, and smooth, with improved theming and accenting support. Currently, light, dark, and midnight themes are available, and red, blue, and purple accents are available. Custom themes will be supported in an upcoming release.\n\nAside from theme and accent support, the UI is designed to be more in line with Elastic and Shuffleboard, taking some inspiration from well-known themes like Windows 7 Aero & Windows 10 Flat.\n\nThe NT Widget and Camera menus now slide in from the side a la Shuffleboard. This allows you to simply open a menu and drag the widget directly onto the current tab, rather than the clunky old system of double-clicking on a popup menu. This results in a much nicer experience that’s easier for non-programmers to understand and use.\n\nOne significant missing feature from the old version was the ability to copy and paste widgets. The new version finally introduces this feature; simply right click a widget and paste it onto the current tab or even a different tab. All changed properties will be copied to the new widget.\n\nThe Field2d widget (used primarily for odometry view) has been entirely overhauled. New settings enable the user to change:\n\nRobot color\n\nShape (Robot, rectangle, circle) – i.e. for displaying non-robot objects\n\nFurthermore, it now supports a vertical display (good for field-relative views), and mirroring based on the alliance, making the view that much closer to reality.\n\nThe camera viewing widget is far improved from last year, with additional performance improvements and the introduction of quality control settings.\n\nBy changing the FPS, compression, and resolution, you can dramatically reduce the bandwidth sent over the network, helping to keep your robot network under the 7Mbps radio limit without compromising user experience.\n\nimage 554×511 15.3 KB\n\nimage 554×511 15.3 KB\n\nimage 554×511 15.3 KB\n\nNote that this menu will be overhauled and improved in a later release, including moving the quality option to become a slider.\n\nMany features are planned to be added, including:\n\nTrajectory Display on Field2d\n\nSwitch tabs based on an NT value\n\nCustom Theming\n\nLots of UI fixes\n\nOverhauled configuration menu\n\nQFRCDashboard uses GitHub Actions, and is fully supported on all platforms–Linux, Windows, and macOS.\n\nSee the latest release here: Releases · Q-FRC/Dashboard · GitHub\n\nWindows builds have the additional option of an installer, allowing you to create desktop and start menu shortcuts for QFRCDashboard.\n\nPlease note that due to the nature of the rewrite, old save files use a completely different format and are not compatible with the new QFRCDashboard. Additionally, due to lack of demand relative to maintenance load, the graph and swerve widgets have been removed–for development purposes I highly recommend using AdvantageScope, which has these features built-in and is much nicer to use for that purpose.\n\nFor more specific installation instructions, see the wiki .\n\nWhen using QFRCDashboard, please bring feedback on potential improvements either to this thread or to the GitHub ’s issues tab ( direct link ).\n\nDocumentation is incomplete so far, but how-tos on installation & usage can be found on the wiki .\n\nI appreciate everyone’s feedback and hope to see plenty of people use it during the season!",

However, one question/concern I have is that, from what it looks like in the video, the error reporting has the same functionality as the WPILib alerts. Is there a reason a team should be using the QFRCLib alerts instead of the WPILib alerts?\n\nGreat work on this! Looking forward to seeing more progress as you continue developing it!",

Everything has been redesigned to be more colorful, uniform, and fall in line with the application’s overarching theme.\n\nComplete redesign of settings & tab configuration dialogs\n\nUnification of dialog designs\n\nComplete redesign of widget configuration dialogs\n\nSignificantly improved theming\n\nRemote Layouts have been added! By deploying your dashboard layout to the robot, you can access these layouts from any computer while connected to the robot–no internet required! This serves to make transferring of layouts significantly easier in cases of:\n\nSwitching computers\n\nCorrupted drives\n\nOther users\n\nNotification support has also been added! Using a similar API to Elastic, you can push notifications from your robot code to be displayed on the dashboard–similar to the earlier alerts added to QFRCLib, but used for temporary/more urgent information.\n\nA large quantity of UI inconsistencies present between platforms has been resolved. QFRCDashboard has thus received a new theme utilizing Qt’s Universal theme, based on the Microsoft Universal style, used in Windows 10 & 11.\n\nAn About dialog has been added.\n\nCameraView Overhaul by @crueter in CameraView Overhaul by crueter · Pull Request #131 · Q-FRC/Dashboard · GitHub\n\nConfiguration Dialog Overhaul by @crueter in config overhaul by crueter · Pull Request #132 · Q-FRC/Dashboard · GitHub\n\nRehauled Tab & Settings Dialogs by @crueter in Rehauled Tab & Settings Dialogs by crueter · Pull Request #135 · Q-FRC/Dashboard · GitHub\n\nUI Fixes & Universal Style by @crueter in UI Fixes & Universal style/accents by crueter · Pull Request #136 · Q-FRC/Dashboard · GitHub\n\nRemote Layout Support by @crueter in Remote Layouts by crueter · Pull Request #138 · Q-FRC/Dashboard · GitHub\n\nNotifications by @crueter in Notifications by crueter · Pull Request #139 · Q-FRC/Dashboard · GitHub\n\nFinal UI Fixes before RC by @crueter in Final UI Fixes before RC by crueter · Pull Request #141 · Q-FRC/Dashboard · GitHub\n\nFull Changelog : Comparing 2025.0.0-beta4...2025.0.0-rc1 · Q-FRC/Dashboard · GitHub\n\nCome the official release time, a new thread will be created to track development progress of the official 2025 release.",
