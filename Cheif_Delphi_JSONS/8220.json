The original sheet was not my idea, and I’ve lost track of who created the version I started with.  Whoever that was has my thanks.\n\nThe goal of this is to be a quick reference so that a robot inspector can identify legal motors and controllers and help with basic wiring and pneumatics.  It is intended as a reference for the rules not best practices.  For example you are allowed to use 22AWG wire to power your RoboRio, but it is recommended to use 18AWG.\n\nI gave a class on how to be ready for inspection and I mentioned a few 3D prints I bring with me as an LRI.\n\nBreaker protector designed by Jon Smith: FRC Breaker protector by Culvan - Thingiverse\n\nBumper gauge: 2019 FRC bumper inspection tool by Culvan - Thingiverse (note bumper rules can change year to year, but we have had several years recently where this one worked)\n\nTo summarize the highlight from that class.  Come to inspection early to make sure that there are no big issues (i.e. frame perimeter, weight, safety) that could take a while to fix.  Make any changes you want / need and get reinspected.  Second the inspection checklist is published around the time of competitions and can be useful to unofficially self inspect your robot prior to the event: CHARGED UP - Season Materials | FIRST\n\n2023 Electronics Robot Inspector Cheat Sheet 2023 V0.pdf (1.2 MB) 2023 Motor and Pneumatic Robot Inspection Cheat Sheet.pdf (443.3 KB)",

As someone who has been there when a breaker has had to be shut off in an emergency, the bigger deal is not being able to find the breaker.\n\nEither of these breaker covers do more than enough to allow emergency access*, so long as the breaker is mounted in a spot where it can be found by field staff, without having to look for it for over a minute. If they are printed in a color that doesn’t hide it in a robot (black on black, red on red, etc.), even better!\n\nThe easier the breaker is to find, the easier it is for field staff to hit the button intentionally. These breaker covers do not inhibit field staff*.\n\nAs for the off season you are referencing, that was a week 0 event that did not run an official field wall, nor FMS (if I remember correctly). There has been 1 time on season I can think of that a robot has gotten off the field in the last 15+ years, and since it was on season, a field e-stop was able to disable the robot.\n\n*All emergency access statements are assuming that the breaker is in an easy to find location that field staff can normally access easily, and not behind polycarbonate side panels, under wires, below arms or manipulators or launching mechanisms, etc.",

Those are yellow and red and large mushroom style twist locks to be obvious and stay down. They are easy to push even with a stick or a foot. The breaker Red little button is not. I have also had an issue of thinking I pressed on the breaker button only for the lever arm not to swing out fully and it stays on.\n\nThe issue with a true E-Stop for an FRC robot would be expense and if someone accidentally hit it mid match like breakers… It has to be able to handle the maximum robot current at all times if it’s directly between the battery and the rest of the system. They could use it instead as a signalling device directly to a robot controller (RoboRio) to disable when the contact isn’t closed. Think like the compressor pressure switch.",

MC “3-2-1-1!” Scorekeeper heard: “3-2-1-GO!” Cue match-start sounds and the MC exiting the field via the nearest guardrail. No robots left the field, but the foghorn sounded very shortly afterwards.\n\n3211 is now referred to as thirty-two eleven.\n\nI also know about a field escape way back in 2003: a team shot across the ramp as planned in auto, then took off under the rail (I think there was a cable between rail and bottom of rail, but it went under that too) and was E-stopped under the stands. Fortunately, it was practice day (Arizona Regional, to be exact, not going to shame the team here).",
