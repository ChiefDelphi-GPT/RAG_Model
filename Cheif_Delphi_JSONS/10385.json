We’re going into the season with the most money we’ve ever had, and we most likely won’t have to travel for any competitions or get hotels. With this in mind, we’re looking at upgrading our tools and shop. The one major tool we’re missing is a lathe, so I’ve been looking at what lathe to get.\n\nMy main question for teams is their opinion on a “mini lathe” (ex 118 pit lathe). We wouldn’t use our lathe for anything much other then shafts <= 7/8\", so it seems excessive to get a full size lathe or a cnc lathe. However, I’ve also heard most mini lathes are low quality and sometimes not worth the extra hassle they create.\n\nWhat are team’s thoughts on this, and if your team has had good experiences with a mini lathe, which one would you recommend?",

Or do you have more advanced plans?\n\nIf it is the former, the cheap Harbor Freight lathe will be fine.\n\nThe Sherline tools are amazing (I have a mini mill) but ultimately overkill for most FRC shaft applications. You are better off having a better accessorized cheaper lathe (die holder, boring bar, die grinder attachment for keyways (maybe), a good array of center drills, indicators, quality quick change tool post, etc)",

                    "cooked": "I like that our team has a lathe. It’s the best way to teach first principles for machining, to make understanding that transfers to mills and CNC routers. It’s also really handy for all sorts of little parts.\n\nIn my experience using a lathe in FRC, the most important dimension of a lathe is its through-bore capacity. If the hole through the spindle is too small, then you’ll have to cut little pieces of stock for everything you want to make, which creates a lot more waste (and an extra step when making parts). To accommodate 1/2\" hex shaft, the through-bore diameter needs to be at least 5/8\". If it’s 3/4\" or bigger, then you can also make spacers and bushings. Among most mini lathes that I’ve seen, there are three groups:  ~3/8\" or 10mm bores, 20mm bores (~0.79\"), and ~1.125\" bores. I strongly recommend not buying a lathe in the first category!\n\nAs far as quality goes, it can be variable. I strongly recommend buying a lathe from a reputable importer, which can provide customer support and warranty replacements. Some USA examples are Little Machine Shop, Grizzly, MicroMark, and Precision Matthews. At 3494’s previous shop, we had a Weiss lathe, which was quite nice ( edit : except that the carriage handwheel was a lie! It was marked as 0.750\" per rotation, but was actually something like 0.788\"), but the importer it was purchased through has since stopped dealing in lathes.",

Without the headstock, the Taig lathe, with a ton of accessories, cost as much as a Harbor Freight mini lathe.\n\nI absolutely love the Taig lathe. It’s shockingly well-made for the price, very modular, and unintimidating and easy to handle. It has no problems with interrupted cuts on hex shaft and churro, and I’ve even managed to turn D2 tool steel on it without mangling it. The only thing it isn’t equipped to do is cut threads, but we just use dies in FRC anyway. (And there are many people who’ve published screw-cutting modifications online.) When cleaning chips from the lathe, you can just tip the whole thing over and dump them out! When I have garage space for my personal shop, this it the lathe I’m getting.",

And it runs on 120v, which can be important.\n\nWe have a 12x42 freestanding lathe on 220v (also a precision Matthews) that is too big for most of our students. The dials land at shoulder level on our 9th graders (and also some of our 12th graders). I can do any FRC part I can imagine, but it’s actually okay to not have that capability. We haven’t needed that “last 2%” in the three years we’ve had it set up. FRC doesn’t really use steel anymore, which is the only reason to have such a big engine.",

Besides the convenience, it’s also safer than the 3-jaw chuck. (No chuck key to be vigilant about, and no jagged chuck jaws whirling around.) I’m thinking about bringing ER40 into our Bridgeport mill too, so students don’t have to constantly reach for the drawbar.\n\nI’m also not ready to recommend the Taig to any team looking for a lathe. 3494 has several machining mentors, so working with a quirky machine hasn’t been a problem. Someday, I may change my mind and do a writeup on how to buy, set up, and run a Taig lathe for FRC (and maybe even FTC) use. The size, weight, quality, and price definitely set it and the Sherline apart from every other lathe out there.",

For many lathes, like the LittleMachineShop HiTorque 7x16, the only way to actually find out was to download and read through the manual. The product listings either don’t say anything at all about handwheel travel (which is the case for the LMS lathe), or (on some other retailers) the product page lies and says that the travel is in inches, but the manual clarifies that it’s only an approximation of the actual travel in millimeters! The only things you can trust are when the handwheels are marked in millimeters (which I could deal with but would be uncomfortable in our otherwise all-inch shop), or, like the MicroMark lathe, when they go out of their way to assure you that they’ve replaced all of the metric racks and leadscrews with “true inch” hardware.",

They come with all the features you will probably want to add at some point to the cheaper lathes you can buy. DRO, cam lock tailstock, power feeds, etc. Also once you have a lathe and start using it, a lot more tasks become tasks you can do or parts you can make on the lathe than before you have one.\n\nAssuming you are planning to be an FRC team for many years, if at all possible buy the lathe your program will want in 5-10 years now instead of spending time and money on something cheaper that the team will replace later.\n\nWe have rarely/never wished we had anything bigger than our 10x20-30in lathes that we have, they are bigger than mini lathes but still approachable and useable by students. The spindles bores are big enough for most FRC tasks and the bearings are large enough that if you have to use it as a press (which you shouldn’t but sometimes it’s the only way), etc you won’t damage it immediately.",

We use it to make spacers out of plastic, and aluminum, make precise bearing holes, etc. There are so many uses for a lathe and the mini lathe is a great cheap entry-level tool that allows for a great start into this. If you can get one with a mill attachment or the attachment that you can buy later on, that’s a great option and something to seriously consider when you are looking for one. 100% get the lathe!",

They replaced it with a new one somewhat recently, and strangely, the motor does not have enough torque to tap 1/4\"-20 on its own anymore.\n\nI would recommend any 7x12 mini lathe. The 7x10 lathes are actually 7x8, so you will pay only slightly more for 4\" extra to play with - handy for keeping your tailsstock mounted all the time and moving parts around. A 3 jaw chuck will handle hex shafts and spacers just fine. I have found that 1/2\" hex collets can be very hit or miss on the fit, so get a good collet brand like Maritool if you go the collet chuck route. The chuck itself can be any brand, for the tolerances we need to hold.\n\nIf you want to round the ends of hex shafts for gearboxes, then you may want to invest in a larger used lathe or higher-quality mini lathe like a Microlux, along with a collet chuck or 6-jaw chuck. You can also just grind down the jaws of the 3-jaw square occasionally, but that’s a pain, even if it gets you within 0.001\" on the concentricity.  It’s also worth looking at some softjaws for the same reason.\n\nIf you get a cutoff tool, The carbide insert ones can work fine, just make sure to have a good stock of inserts. HSS cutoff bars are better but are weirdly pricey? If you get a 0.04\" wide one that can be good for circlips.\n\nNo matter what you go with, get a quick change tool post, preferably a wedge-type one.",
