                    "cooked": "Our team used two limelight cameras this year - one LL3G for april tags and one “standard” LL3 that we used for pole detection.  Each camera was plugged into an aux port on our radio with CAT6 cabling.  Not using POE and no other ethernet items so didn’t need another switch.  Every now and then (maybe like 5% of the time), one camera or the other would not establish ethernet comms.  Little blinky LEDs on radio and camera ports wouldn’t even light up.  Power cycling the camera, or simply unplugging the ethernet cable and plugging it back in would result in comms coming up as normal.  What I found strange was that if we went the route of unplugging/plugging the ethernet cable, the amount of time it took to have connection established seemed the same as if we did a full power cycle of the camera.  Anyone else fight this?  Is there something we’re supposed to be doing for NT4 connections that we’re not doing?",

I wonder if adding the switch would have helped us out with that.  But all I can do is wonder now … until next season.  Thanks for input.",

Once it took 3 power cycles on the field.  We started powering up at the 20 second mark of the previous match to make sure it was booted as fast as possible so we had time to power cycle if needed.  I was checking the cable Everytime too.  But that never seemed to be the issue.\n\nWe ended up bringing a tag with us to check the camera could see it.  Our tech giving us the thumbs up or down and power cycling if not.\n\nWhole thing drove us nuts.  I don’t think we ever repeated it in the pit.\n\nIssues last year with an Ethernet switch kept us from adding one in again.",
