Each camera was connected to an aux port on our radio via CAT6 cabling. Without using POE or other Ethernet equipment, we didn't need an additional switch. Occasionally (about 5% of the time), either camera failed to establish Ethernet communication. The blinking LEDs on both the radio and camera ports stayed off during these instances. Restarting the camera by cycling its power or simply unplugging and replugging the Ethernet cable restored communication. It was notable that reconnecting the cable took roughly the same time as performing a full power cycle on the camera. Have you experienced this issue before? Could there be something specific regarding NT4 connections we're overlooking?",

I thought it was required that RoboRIO had to be plugged directly into radio, but I must be mistaken. We also battled what seemed to be slow vision position updates occasionally (only during autonomous running pathplanner paths, and ONLY when connected to the field). I wonder if adding the switch would have helped us out with that. But all I can do is wonder now … until next season. Thanks for input.</p>",

We had to restart the robot multiple times, sometimes even three times during a match. We made sure to power it up 20 seconds before the previous match ended to give ourselves enough time to reset it if needed. I also checked the cable every time, though that didn’t seem to be the issue.\n\nUltimately, we brought a tag to test if the camera could detect it, with our technician either giving us a thumbs-up or a signal to power cycle it if it failed. This whole situation was frustrating and something we rarely repeated in the pit. Last year, issues with an Ethernet switch prevented us from adding one again.",

Sometimes, links may not work properly, or the content might be cached incorrectly. Accessing Limelight directly through a web browser might result in slow loading times, broken images, or connectivity problems. Ensuring your browser has the necessary plugins for viewing video feeds is also important. If none of these technical issues resolve the problem, try accessing the feed through a dedicated application. Additionally, verify that your device has sufficient bandwidth for smooth video playback. Confirming whether there was a problem with the camera feed when accessing Limelight via a web browser is crucial. Slow website loading can affect video display, which might be due to a poor internet connection or outdated browser versions. Enabling JavaScript is essential for streaming media. Clearing the browser cache or using an incognito window might bypass cache issues. Checking for server downtime or maintenance on the Limelight-hosted server and verifying browser compatibility with Limelight’s technology are also important considerations. It might help to know if others are experiencing similar issues. If none of these steps work, contacting Limelight’s customer support would be the appropriate next step.",
