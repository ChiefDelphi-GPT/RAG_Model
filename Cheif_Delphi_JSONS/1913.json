The goal is to provide teams with an efficient, easy-to-integrate solution for processing camera data outside the roboRIO, freeing up valuable CPU resources and enabling more advanced algorithms, without locking to user to using speicific algorithms and allowing custom code to be ran natively.\n\nCustom pipelines are integrated automatically into the UI, without modifying the UI code itself, and have settings rendered the same as any other pipeline would have, and their settings are verified automatically\n\nAll of the settings are validated automatically via constraints saved inside the runtime and verified in runtime\n\nCustom pipelines are written exactly the same way as the built in ones, even camera calibration is a pipeline .\n\nBasic Apriltag Processing - Due to the dynamic nature of the library, expanding this was delayed until everything was functionally working and communicating since once the whole runtime knows to work with A pipeline it doesn’t matter what is written inside it.\n\nFully Featured UI written in React with support for infinitley many pipelines and cameras - The runtime is limited by the hardware, not the software\n\nBasic integrated camera calibration - This will be expanded in the very soon future but currently works for ChAruco calibration boards\n\nSettings Access both from UI and NT - almost everything is modifiable everywhere (Some stuff that aren’t modifiable from NT include device restarting & network config)\n\nSettings Verification API - allows pipelines to not worry about verifying or clamping values, the settings API handles that for them.\n\nPartial Documentation - While not all of the project is currently documented (e.g robot interfacing works but is not documented at the moment of writing this), a large majority is.\n\nStatic Camera Identifiers - persists between reboots\n\nProtoBuf messaging between UI and backend - Any UI can be implemented for the user’s needs as long as it can communicate with the runtime with the messages it requires.\n\nBase Robot interfacing with the runtime - While not very performant at the moment for multiple tag results from the AprilTag Pipeline, future improvements are already being worked on and planned.\n\nCustom pipelines support Custom pipelines can be written using the same way the built in ones are - with Python Code Deployment to a coprocessor is handled in a simmilar fashion to Robot Code deployment.\n\nCustom pipelines can be written using the same way the built in ones are - with Python\n\nCode Deployment to a coprocessor is handled in a simmilar fashion to Robot Code deployment.\n\nAbility to run the runtime outside of the robot - Since this is wirtten with Python, no special compiling is needed to run on any machine, including your own development computer.\n\nEasy to install PyPi package to work with the project\n\nSynapse Web UI 1919×919 66.5 KB\n\nSynapse Web UI 1919×919 66.5 KB\n\nSynapse Web UI 1919×919 66.5 KB\n\nBetter Apriltag Pipeline\n\nColor Detection Pipeline\n\nBetter Results API\n\nMore types of settings\n\nRecording Camera Output\n\nGitHub Repository - All of the code is OpenSource and hosted under the gnu v3 license Documentation Discord Server\n\nA lot of thanks and appriciation for the following people:\n\n@nstrike For helping setting up the vendordep library for the robot interfacing, style choices with the UI, networking, support and encouragement with the project\n\nChris from team 5561 For helping setting up the discord community and styling choices with the UI, support and encouragement with the project\n\n@Peter_Johnson For helping and answering endless questions and issues setting up CSCore within python and versioning\n\nMy Team, Ionic Bond 9738 For giving this project a place to live and exist both on the robot and in person\n\nDISCLAIMER: THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN ALPHA AND ISN’T FINISHED, TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION",

However, don’t forget that the image processing is (in my experience) a pretty small part of the process (I was going to say “minor”, but clearly it is important).  The majority of the work has often been processing the data from the image.\n\nSo, to be more concrete: processing the image looking for Apriltags is very likely to be the same for everyone. Where I would want to customize is taking all the found tags and filtering and computing to produce poses which are sent to the robot.\n\nBut the architecture looks very promising.",

The two serve different purposes. While PhotonVision focuses on a ready-to-use vision solution, this project is built for teams who want a flexible foundation to run their own custom vision code on a coprocessor. That means it might go far beyond what some teams need or want—but it’s there for anyone who wants that level of control.\n\nLooking back, I realize I should have made this distinction clearer in the original post.",

Basically Python and a systemd service in most cases.\n\nAnd those that don’t have the resources, just use one of the existing solutions. PhotonVision on a Pi is very cheap and takes like 5 minutes to get running for example, and has the best robot side API in my opinion.\n\nSo I guess I’m confused on how many “in-between” teams this really serves?",
