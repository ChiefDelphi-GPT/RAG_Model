I was just curious about what other mentors have learned after doing this and what they would do differently if you could? I really want to build and program my own swerve bot the most and a bot with a turret (never done that before). I have been working on a swerve drive with my team but when limited to shop time it’s gone slowwww. Any advice is welcome!",

One thing I struggle with as a mentor is the fact that it’s often hard to teach something you don’t know so learning it first off site is often better, but at the same time it’s good for the students to go through the process of figuring things out and / or seeing you do it and learning how to figure things out rather than just being given the answers all the time. It’s a tough balance, especially with limited meeting time and short attention spans.\n\nI don’t have a full FRC shop in my garage (though the team has had to build there more then once, luckily not right now) but I do have a fairly decent general shop in my garage. I’ve definitely figured stuff out at home sometimes, then gone back and shared it with the team. Other times I’ve insisted they figure it out, for the learning how to figure things out lesson. I think I change my approach based on the students involved and the problem at hand, and often purposefully only figure out half of the problem myself and make sure they work with me to figure out the other half. I think that eases the process a bit, reduces the pain and boredom a bit in the early stages, but still lets them learn the lessons on how to figure things out rather than waiting for a teacher to give them all the right answers as they are often so used to.\n\nNot sure that’s the type of advice your looking for or if it’s helpful, just what came to mind reading this.\n\nFYI, Im not a teacher, we have no teachers on the team and are not associated with a school, so I don’t know anything official about education.",

The best garage shop our mentor Ulf ( @tribologist ) has includes heating, which is a really nice touch when we need to meet at his house if the school cancels a meeting.\n\nAnother tool related note I’d advocate for is nice electrical tools. I feel like its the area where a lot of people will cheap out on when purchasing something for their homes, but Anderson crimpers, nice diagonal cutters/wire cutters, automatic strippers, etc are super critical to ensure you don’t have to repeat shoddy work caused by a bad tool.\n\nMy wife and I are in the same boat as you - it would be ideal to have a full set of all FRC components at home so you can learn things yourself which makes mentoring kids a lot easier. Our hope is to get a full control system including rio, just need to find a team willing to sell one!",

                    "cooked": "Be realistic with what you want to accomplish.  If it’s just to build an FRC style robot once, that’s different than building one every season, which is also different from then using the space for other tasks on an occasional/common/everyday cadence.  Use this along with the existing skills and equipment of the team(s) you plan to help to plan your space and tool purchases.  It is entirely possible to build a competent and sufficient FRC robot with no more power tools than a handheld drill and sawzall, and decent collection of hand tools.  If you’re building it once, that might be the route to go, but since you’re saying a garage shop, I’m assuming you’re looking for a bit more than that.  The most common items teams use are likely drill presses and band saws, which make a good example to weight that with your “other” level of use to guide what to get.  A big box store drill press will be sufficient for most home type use and still sufficient for building a robot, but if you plan to use the shop of other things or other more advanced types of machining, you might want to forego the drill press entirely, or go with a more advanced unit with a digital read out (DRO) or similar.  Same for the band saw, you can get a lot of mileage out of a benchtop or floor one from a big box store, more than enough to build a robot, but if you’re going to do other work out there as well (maybe some woodworking on the side), you might want to step up to a better unit.  Same goes for all the other possible tools as well.\n\nConsider what power you have available.  We just moved, and the first thing I drew up for the shop building we’ll add eventually was an electricity diagram.  You just can’t usually run a good 120V dust collector and a saw on a 15A circuit (side call out to consider dust collection!  This is your home, you don’t want to be tracking metal swarf all over).  Sometimes you can’t even run a drill press and chop saw on the same 15A circuit.  If you’ll be the only person out there using tools, that’s less of a problem, but if you get or add “set and forget” tools like 3d printers or laser cutters or CNC mills and all, you can quickly run out of power.  That may drive some decisions of what to put in the space.\n\nI’d start off with looking at what tools your team has, and couple that with your wants and budget and start with those.  Building a good technique on a band saw to make accurate cuts, and getting and knowing how to use and using a good fence with it may in itself move your teams forward in their capabilities and quality.  Same with a drill press, a lot of teams never change the belts to do different speeds, but that can make a big difference in both tool life and end result quality, and that’s something to learn by experimenting on different materials, reading spec sheets and machining charts, and then teach.\n\nAdd tools as you need them or feel you have sufficient skill with the previous stuff and want to expand your capabilities.  It’s tempting to want to just “outfit” the shop all at once with a laser cutter, CNC mill, 3D printers, all the things, but I personally think that’s only worthwhile if you have a big grant you have to spend, or have to be very selective about what you can fit in your space and have it all planned out for very specific units to maximize what you can fit in the space.  If you have everything, it becomes tempting to use whatever you know best or whatever is the most fun or whatever you want to learn the most rather than actually knowing each tool well and what it can do efficiently and accurately.  You can cut a hole into a plastic part for the bot with a handheld drill, a drill press, a mill, a CNC mill, a lathe possibly, a laser cutter, or print your own piece with a 3d printer.  Only with experience on each will you know which is most appropriate to that specific task.  Then you also wind up with tools that never get used.  If your team doesn’t build designs or do prototyping with laser-cut pieces, it doesn’t make sense to get a laser cutter, at least until you want to introduce that capability to your team.  Once the foundational skills are there, maybe you do find some parts that would probably be more efficient or more accurate to do using a different tool, like a mill or laser cutter, so add that to the skillset and arsenal.  Maybe your team loves coloring the robot, so getting into powder coating parts rather than using spray paint is more worthwhile to grab and maintain student interest and build certain skills (like planning, so they don’t mess up a powder coat with not having made all the holes before coating it or similar).  Consider your goals for your teams, be them student engagement, student enjoyment, design robustness, design flexibility, construction quality, aesthetic quality, and let that guide selecting what to start with, keep it focused to start, and then build from there.",

I spend a lot of time cleaning up in my home shop in between work modes, like if I’m doing woodwork and then I need to be doing electronics or welding, I have to completely clean up one mess before I make a different kind.  Or when you are assembling gear boxes that are covered with grease, you don’t want to be quickly switching modes into making wood dust or metal flakes in the same space without controlling your mess. I put a shop dust collection system on anything that cuts or sands to help mitigate the mess but I still also end up bagging robots that are in the shop while I woodwork etc.\n\nPutting shop tools and benches on rolling bases can help tremendously with optimizing your space if it’s limited, but again, depending on what kind of tooling you will be working with.  For me, I switch modes between “building” hobbies frequently, I do automotive/motorcycle stuff, guitar building, woodwork, bicycle repair, RC and drones, and a bunch of other things (I have way too many hobbies), in my shop I needed to think about what were the things I was going to be doing most often, where to put the tools for each so they were organized, not messing with each other, and how to be able to move stuff to get into whatever work mode I needed to be in without spending half a day getting set up.  Organization and layout is critical if you don’t have a huge space.",

A membership to a makerspace can be cheaper than buying a machine yourself. You’re profile says you’re from San Antonio. There is a place called 10Bitworks that looks promising.\n\nArduinos Look into using Arduinos early on, they are a pretty cheap “brain” to start with.

Workbenches, toolboxes, and tools - put some casters on there. Ditto the above sentiments about good wiring equipment. I also have tons of storage boxes and bins as well as a couple of shelves.\n\nIt appears that you may have T.A.S. **.\n\nBe sure that at least 2 of the casters lock so your equipment doesn’t move while being used.\n\nThere are also casters that extend and retract when operated by a foot. When retracted, the legs of the table or equipment stand will contact the floor. Woodworking suppliers such as Rockler, Woodcraft and Lee Valley Tools are good places to find them.\n\nVisit your local bookstore or magazine store and look through the woodworking magazines for ideas for efficient storage and work tables.\n\nMake sure you have adequate access to electrical power for the equipment. Most garages I have seen have only one dual receptacle. Recently, I installed a retractable power cord with a 40 foot reach in the middle of the ceiling and plugged it into the receptacle in the ceiling for the garage door opener. I wish I had done this sooner. While this solution works for me, it may not be adequate when you have a bunch of students visiting, working on a variety of things at the same time.\n\n** Tool Acquisition Syndrome.

I feel like its the area where a lot of people will cheap out on when purchasing something for their homes, but Anderson crimpers, nice diagonal cutters/wire cutters, automatic strippers, etc are super critical to ensure you don’t have to repeat shoddy work caused by a bad tool.\n\nI second this. I’m not particularly interested in the electrical side of things but having a parent who is an electrical engineer I’ve ended up with some higher quality tools over the years. One of the best tools I ever bought myself was a proper pair of knipex combination wire cutters and strippers. Even for someone who does minimal electrical work having nicer tools makes it so much easier. Good electrical tools can also make it a lot easier to justify buying older equipment whos electrics are not good and need some repair. Great way to get some money off of larger tools.\n\nMight get a little bit of backlash for this one but I’d honestly suggest a proper used Bridgeport(Or any kneemill) with a dro and maybe a smaller lathe. Doesn’t have to be a full 50in table version or anything but having a mill is so darn useful I’ve found and opens up so many possibilities. I don’t personally have one at home but I have access to several at work (I run the machine shop at an electrical engineering firm) and this has allowed me to quickly prototype ideas and I honestly don’t know what i’d do without it. Also outside of robot stuff the amount of crap around your home that you can fix with a mill and a lathe is substantial so over the long run it could very well pay for itself kind of like the lathe I have did.",
