                    "cooked": "We have been 3d printing pulleys for 2 seasons and we are happy with the durability of them. However, we are not sure about the efficiency and couldn’t find a accurate testing method. I have a few questions about this topic and would like to get the other teams opinions.\n\nFirst of all, what are the suitable materials? We have been 3d printing with PLA since it is easier to print but I want to try other common ones such as ABS and Nylon.\n\nI always tried to maximize the layer height in order to increase the resistance of the parts. However, I believe that it will increase the friction. So what could be the optimal point for a 0.4mm nozzle.\n\nAlso, what percentage and pattern of infill is most suitable for pulleys? We mostly use triangle for  parts that only get radial load such as pulleys and cubic for the rest of the parts.\n\nFinally, some teams use huge flanges that are probably impossible to print without supports. I think using support material can cause  bad layer quality. What can be a good solution to this problem? A few ideas that come to mind is printing the flanges seperately and gluing them and the other is using supports only on the outside of the pitch of the pulley.\n\nI’m also aware that many teams use markedforged printers and don’t bother with the slicer settings too much. However, we only get can print common materials with simple printers .\n\nBy the way I am using Cura for slicing the parts.",

                    "cooked": "We use a mix of Onyx, PETG, tough Pla/pla+, and SLS nylon 12. All of them work well for us but they all require different strategies.\n\nFor FDM pulleys, we generally use a 0.4 nozzle, 2-4 walls, and 20-50% density. For MarkForged parts, we almost always run .125 layer height. We occasionally run 0.2 when we need parts the same day. On the prusa printers, it’s generally 0.15 to 0.3 range. We run all SLS stuff solid by nature so we will pocket them out or slim the cross section down to 1/8” range.\n\nFor flanges, we run larger flanges on systems in motion to help keep the belt on the pulleys. Something like our intakes this year ran huge flanges to stop the belt front walking off during impacts. Internal systems that are static will get a flange that is flush or close to flush on the belt to help with mounting/clearance.\n\nFor support on these flanges, you have 3 choices. You can print with a soluble support if you have a dual extruder printer (we do this on Ultimaker S5’s), you can print same material support, or you can design in supports to the middle and cut them off after printing. I prefer to use same material support. You can modify Z support offset in cura to help with adhesion/not wanting adhesion. Make sure when you change this, you go to the preview window and look to make sure you have Blank layers between the support and the part. Your probably using a single layer now but try it with 2 and 3 layers offset. You will tune this for your material but it makes a world of difference. Also check your horizontal expansion on the part and support to make sure you don’t have “bleed” from one part to the support which makes it much harder to remove support. You will see a slight decrease on the support surface finish but it is purely internal and does not matter. A quick razor blade or just run the belt in after.\n\nTry these above and feel free to PM me any questions.",

Coarser layers RADICALLY speed up printing, but will make the top flange harder to do.\n\nOn a fancy slicer you could use coarse for the ribbed area and fine layers on the flanges!\n\nI got in trouble when I printed multiple pulleys; very organized boogers that I had to dremel out.  Flange supports were actually pretty easy to remove and to clean up after (most of the crud was on the crests of the teeth).",

One is basically a top hat, containing the middle and one flange, while the other is the other flange, with a small cutout on one side so the center fits in it.  Get good precision, and they basically snap together.  Add in appropriate constraints on the shaft so they can’t pull apart (there should be minimal side-load, so it doesn’t take much!), and you’re golden.",

We’ve also experimented with Atomic Filament’s PETG as well and have had no problems.\n\nFor settings, our parts are sliced in either PrusaSlicer or Cura because we just outsource our printing to students and mentors. Either works, but there are a few big factors that you need to keep an eye on. Most importantly, 4+ walls always . Depending on the quality of your printer, you can even push 6 or 7, but we rarely go beyond that as it’s largely unnecessary. Perimeter count is much more effective in beefing up your parts than infill percentage, although I would still recommend 20-30% infill, and we usually use gyroid or grid, once again depending on who’s printing the pulley. We haven’t had problems with layer height, and I think there’s actually a great CNC Kitchen video based on the strength of different layer heights. Because speed is king during build season, we are usually rocking 0.25-0.32 layer height for our pulleys, and haven’t noticed excess wear in our belts. I would also note that you may want to print a little hotter than normal with a bit higher flow multiplier, as you will strengthen your parts dramatically, although they may not be as pretty.\n\nIn terms of flanges, we just use a parametric model in SolidWorks for almost all of our pulleys, which has a relatively standard flange - these print great with decent part cooling and no supports, which also reduces printing time. Unless you’re loading your pulleys awkwardly or they are experiencing a lot of vibration, I wouldn’t worry about just using a normal flange. The one area we had to opt for something a little more intense was our intake, which undergoes by far the most vibration out of any subsystem on our bot this year. These we machined out of aluminum with specialty large flange pulleys.",

A few notes: -I don’t usually care much about support–it’s not that bad to get out in most cases even with both flanges. Takes time, though, and whatever you do don’t use a hex pattern on your support. -Allow some print allowance if you do that anyways. Had some interesting times trying to find the slip… -We just use the same settings as on every other ABS print we do. Maybe more shell, maybe a bit more infill. Stock, came-with-printer slicer.",

Onyx will too if you abuse them enough. That’s the one downside of printed pulleys, but usually something mechanically has gone wrong if this is happening or your belt tension is not correct.\n\nI also never use supports. It just creates more cleanup and the teeth never come out as clean as they do just printing without supports. Add a few extra mm to the pulley width and clean up any overhang grossness, but usually they come out fairly clean when you chamfer the pulley flanges.\n\nWe ran a lot of printed pulleys this season and it seems like the future. It’s just too easy and gives you a ton of flexibility to go print an odd tooth count pulley if maybe you didn’t hit the center to center distance the first time around.",
