Appreciate any help. Best regards.

What are you trying to accomplish? Is it possible to share a diagram, sketch or picture of what the goal is?\n\nThe following is speculation: Are you trying to cool the cim with air from a compressor? It the overall goal a cooler motor?",

More than anything, I could say its a rookie year for my and my team, since most of us except for 2 just joined this year and we are learning, and the old members are not always free to come and give us aid especially at this time.\n\nimage 1494×1089 128 KB\n\nimage 1494×1089 128 KB\n\nimage 1494×1089 128 KB",

Hex Shaft Adapter\n\nIf I understand correctly, by line or tube you are referring to the hexagonal shaped output shaft on this motor. You are saying you don’t want to use this motor though because it is taken apart and you don’t trust it (I agree!).\n\nIf the other CIM motors have a 8 millimeter diameter output shaft, then the linked adapter is what you likely need.\n\nAm I correct in this interpretation?\n\nIf that is what you need, you will also need this 2 x 2 x 10 mm Machine Key - AndyMark, Inc\n\nTo help us help you - can you provide a link to the gearbox you are missing? Is it purchased from Andymark, REV, VEX, West Coast Products?\n\nIf you can find a link to the product you are missing that would be helpful!\n\nOtherwise - are you just missing the gear that goes on the end of the motor? Does it look like this for the other motors? - NEO Pinions - REV Robotics\n\nSearch on these websites and please let us know what part you are looking for or missing:\n\nShop Gearboxes for a great selection including Single Speed Planetary Gearboxes, Spur - Dual Speed, Spur - Single Speed Gearboxes, and Bevel & Worm Gearboxes\n\nShop online for AndyMark, Inc. products\n\nWestCoast Products\n\nhttps://www.revrobotics.com/ion/motion/gearboxes/\n\nAnother team in your area might have exactly what you need, if you can help us find what you’re looking for or what your motor is trying to attach to, that would be best.",

It works best if the CIM has a bit of a flat spot.\n\nIt works the same as this = Shaft Collars - 10 Pack - REV Robotics but in the hex shaft itself. The screw used to clamp the hex to the CIM shaft should use loctite or another retaining “glue”.\n\nIf I had no other option, I would use glue/loctite in addition to a set screw if possible.",

Something like this: McMaster-Carr If you have access to a well stocked machine shop they might already have the right size.  they can be very handy if you use Neos and CIMs. You may also be able to take that hex adapter off the bad CIM and reuse it. You might have to heat up the adapter to get it loose.\n\nIt sounds like you have enough Neo motors and are only missing the gearbox parts. If that’s right, you can put the same hex adapter on a Neo or a CIM , so you might still be better off with the Neos. And if the gear boxes had a reduction stage in them which they probably did, that would slow down the output and give you more torque so you might need to figure out if your shooter will even work with the increased speed.",
