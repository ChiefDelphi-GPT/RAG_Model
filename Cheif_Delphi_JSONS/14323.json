                    "cooked": "I am looking for advice on how to program our robot to shoot while moving. Our robot has a turret flywheel shooter with an adjustable hood. We can already shoot while stationary by using the limelight to determine the angle and distance to goal (and thus flywheel speed, turret angle, and hood angle; we have done tests to determine the ideal flywheel speed and hood angle for several distances and we interpolate the rest). I would like to incorporate the robot’s velocity into consideration when determining these three variables.\n\nAs for thinking of this as a physics problem, we know the robot’s distance from the goal (determined by limelight & some code utils), as well as the robot’s velocity (determined by WPILib’s ChassisSpeeds class). What makes this problem difficult is how little information we have about the ball. Since its launch speed, angle, and time in the air are all determined by the distance to the goal (which determines flywheel speed and hood angle), I’m thinking I could have another data table that relates distance from goal to time in the air. Given these quantities, I could determine the turret angle that should result in the ball going in the direction of the goal.\n\nShooting While Moving Physics 960×720 78.1 KB\n\nShooting While Moving Physics 960×720 78.1 KB\n\nShooting While Moving Physics 960×720 78.1 KB\n\nHowever, even if the ball is now going in the right direction, it will still overshoot or undershoot the goal if the robot’s velocity component in the y direction is nonzero. I have also realized that adjusting the flywheel speed or hood angle to counter this problem would alter the ball’s time in the air, which would mess up my earlier calculations.\n\nDoes anyone have suggestions as to how I should alter my approach? I am trying to avoid getting too deep into the physics of the ball (launch speed based on flywheel speed and friction, Magnus effect, etc) as I worry any approach I could take would be oversimplified and inaccurate. But if the only way forward is to investigate this approach, that would be useful to know as well.\n\nAny advice and help would be appreciated! Thank you : )",

Basically instead of treating the robot as moving and goal as stationary, treat the robot as stationary and the goal as moving. Then you can find where the goal will be after the time it takes for the ball to get there and adjust shooter speed, turret angle, and hood angle from there.\n\nYou shouldn’t need to take into account magnus effect and all the physics stuff because it should be automatically accounted for in the data points you get from testing.\n\nI haven’t been able to test my math yet (waiting for our robot to be finished), but if it works, I plan to make a post/guide about it after the season once I have more time.",

I do essentially what I detailed in the diagram (except I realized I was doing the transformation backwards), and the new distance to the goal (to determine flywheel speed and hood angle) is b. I have attached my code, which also contains a basic physics simulation to test the algorithm. I haven’t gotten to test much on a real robot yet either, but if I do I’ll provide an update. Also if anyone wants me to do a more in-depth explanation of my code I can provide that as well. mvsht.c (7.4 KB)",

I guess the “arc shot” math might be of use as well as the robot position stuff. In my opinion just finding some heuristic function to relate the two or some linear equation relating all your values with a table would be much easier to tune / troubleshoot, but if you are also a team w/o a big practice field to tune these things then I totally get where you are coming from.\n\nyay 1037×656 83.3 KB this is what a “straight” shot vs an “arc” shot would look like. I kept velocity constant in this situation because our shooter last year really wasn’t accurate at any velocity other than one. The only velocity adjustments I do on the shooter are for interpolating for movement. If you want more details on the math lemme know and I can go into more details. I think my one big takeaway from this whole project was figuring out ways to accurately read the velocity of a ball coming out of our shooter. Ultimately everything had to be extremely precise to achieve reasonable results and it took us quite some time to finally dial everything in - if using physics to model your shooter is how you want to do it I wish you the best of luck.\n\nyay 1037×656 83.3 KB\n\nyay 1037×656 83.3 KB",

So if you are driving towards the goal, change the shot angle and velocity until the shot ball (*after it leaves the robot) will exactly match what it would for a stationary robot? If you make some assumptions about the theta direction, it simplifies quite a bit too, to the point where you are just changing your angle relative to the goal, not the distance/angle of the shot\n\nTo explain it a different way. We all know how to solve the static case, which tells you exactly what the x, y, and z velocities of the ball should be to hit the target perfectly. So all you have to do is change the horizontal angle, vertical angle, and velocity of the shot so that the velocity of the ball after it leaves the robot will exactly match the velocities of the static case",

                    "cooked": "I think I did the algebra for shooting while moving. The idea is to start with the parameters for a static shot, and to change the robot parameters (velocity, hood angle, turret angle) until they cancel out the motion. Or, to put it another way, the combination of the motion of the robot and the shot/applied motion of the ball equal the static shot parameters\n\nI switched between coordinate systems a little. Lets define our output variables (sort of in spherical coordinates): v_s, theta_v, and theta_h. v_s is the shot velocity, theta_v is the vertical angle of the shot from the horizontal (hood angle), and theta_h is the horizontal angle on the field.\n\nI described the robot velocities as v_x and v_y, the velocities in the x and y directions (cartesian, same reference point as theta_h is defined from) I described the static shot parameters as V, phi_v, and phi_h. V is the velocity of the shot, phi_v is the angle from the horizontal, and phi_h is the horizontal angle (pointing directly towards the goal). These would be determined by a lookup table, or a trajectory calculator/optimizer. Assume these are known constants (for one shot)\n\nThe nest step is to convert everything to cartesian coordinates of the field; x, y and z. Then, we need to calculate the values of our output variables vs, theta_v, and theta_h, such that the combination of the robot velocities relative to the field and the shot velocity relative to the robot match the static shot values (V, phi_v, and phi_h).\n\nThis is set up as v_s_x - v_x = V_x, v_s_y - v_y = V_y, and v_s_z = V_z (because v_z is zero).\n\nUsing the conversions from spherical to cartesian coordinates, we can define v_s_z in terms of v_s, theta_v, and theta_h (v_s_x = v_s*cos(theta_v)*cos(theta_h), and so on for the other variables. Then we solve for the output variables (the solution is not terrible by hand, see the images below) move_while_shooting_solution 2017×1169 429 KB\n\nmove_while_shooting_solution 2017×1169 429 KB\n\nmove_while_shooting_solution 2017×1169 429 KB\n\nI haven’t coded it up yet or put it into a physics sim, I am somewhat confident it will work (and that I didn’t make any mistakes)\n\nIMG_20220413_113645 3456×4608 4.19 MB IMG_20220413_113655 3456×4608 2.83 MB\n\nIMG_20220413_113645 3456×4608 4.19 MB\n\nIMG_20220413_113645 3456×4608 4.19 MB\n\nIMG_20220413_113655 3456×4608 2.83 MB\n\nIMG_20220413_113655 3456×4608 2.83 MB",
