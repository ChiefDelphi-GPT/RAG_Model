                    "cooked": "I was having a conversation and it got me thinking about this thread: Stop Trying to Do Trap! and this thread Is the TRAP a trap?\n\nNow that the official competition season has wrapped, I wanted to bring the conversation to a full-circle.  The early consensus was that the trap was not worth it for most teams.  This is also one of a few years where a game design challenge was worth very little points in-game but was worth a bunch when determining ranking.\n\nI want to know how this game mechanic impacted the FIRST community.\n\nBot was designed to Trap, it was worth it! Bot was designed to Trap, we regret it! Bot was not designed to Trap, it was worth it! Bot was not designed to Trap, we regret it! 0 voters\n\nBot was designed to Trap, it was worth it! Bot was designed to Trap, we regret it! Bot was not designed to Trap, it was worth it! Bot was not designed to Trap, we regret it!\n\nBot was designed to Trap, it was worth it!\n\nBot was designed to Trap, we regret it!\n\nBot was not designed to Trap, it was worth it!\n\nBot was not designed to Trap, we regret it!\n\n0 voters\n\n0 voters\n\n0 voters\n\nAlso, now that the season is over,  what is your perspective on the value the trap brought to the game?  I have two poles, one for teams that did trap and one for teams that did not. Please only answer the pole that is appropriate for your team.  A rating of a 5 means that the ability to trap had a strong correlation on determining team success at events. A rating of 0 means that the ability to trap had no impact on events.\n\nValue of the Trap for teams did Trap (5 being the most value) 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 voters\n\nValue of the Trap for teams did Trap (5 being the most value) 0 1 2 3 4 5\n\nValue of the Trap for teams did Trap (5 being the most value)\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n0 voters\n\n0 voters\n\n0 voters\n\nValue of the Trap for teams that did not trap (5 being the most value) 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 voters\n\nValue of the Trap for teams that did not trap (5 being the most value) 0 1 2 3 4 5\n\nValue of the Trap for teams that did not trap (5 being the most value)\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n0 voters\n\n0 voters\n\n0 voters",

                    "cooked": "We approached trap from two angles…\n\nFor Qualifications :\n\nTrap is extremely valuable for Ranking , since it’s probably the easiest RP to get as long as you have one other robot that can climb and a consistent trap mechanism. Especially true later in the season as the Speaker RP threshold increased.\n\nLess valuable as a meaningful source of points in a match, not many quals matches determined by <5 point margins (of our 46 quals matches, 5 were within 5 points {~10%}).\n\nFor Eliminations :\n\nHigher ranking during quals beneficial for picking better alliance.\n\nUseful situationally as a tiebreaker if the scores look close in the last 20 seconds, particularly if Amp is off-cycle and you only have time for one more note.\n\nPersonally, I put the most weight on the benefits of ranking higher. This year it was pretty much guaranteed that most robots would be at least marginally capable of scoring notes in the Amp or Speaker (or at least be designed to), but the odds of getting an alliance in quals where all three robots had climbing mechanisms at all, let alone working (and at least two of them climbing together) was much lower. By lowering the threshold to two climbing robots, the trap made it much easier to pick up that last ranking point in quals matches. The points benefit has always been somewhat negligible except at levels of play where scores could be expected to be quite close\n\nAs for elims, the benefits of ranking high, particularly rank 1, are huge. There’s been a number of threads on this, but odds of winning an event as the 1st alliance is significantly higher than any other alliance, so anything you can do to lock in that #1 spot is worth doing, if you ask me; and this year, Trap was the X-factor for that.",

Especially true later in the season as the Speaker RP threshold increased.\n\nExcept that lots of teams chose not to climb at all, making the Ensemble RP just as much of a dice roll whether you had a 100% reliable trap mechanism, or none at all. Our experience was that for all the effort, the trap didn’t feel like it boosted our ranking at all",

This was good.\n\nI don’t think it’s very different from typical - end games are usually their own unique function (excluding 2023) and require some unique subsystem. The hard part of the trap wasn’t that you need another subsystem, it was that you needed to design the one or two subsystems you already had around this extra capability which is just within reach.",

The importance was focused on ranking high which is something that has been a struggle for the team in the past. Everyone eventually agreed to this strategy, though it was not unanimous. We built what I believe is genuinely one of the best trap bots in the world, and we are really proud of that.\n\nGenerally, it did do what we had hoped. We were able to rank 10th at our first event and 2nd at our second. The problem is that you get more ranking points on average from winning matches.\n\nWe spent so much time, energy, and effort trying to get the trap to work that we struggled to perform the other game tasks at a competitive level. It also drastically pulled from our drive practice time. Due to this, it was incredibly difficult for us to win in the elimination rounds. Our opponents could most often outscore us. The trap was WAYYYY under-valued from a points perspective IMHO, and our team was not worried about the match points, but the ranking points.\n\nOverall it was an excellent mechanical design and manufacturing effort that the team learned a LOT from. It was not the best choice from a competitive perspective as many of the best teams in the world could not trap, which was an important reflection of the team.",

                    "cooked": "The following is my personal opinion and likely doesn’t represent the entire team.\n\nTo add a bit more context about the resources trapping pulled away from other aspects of our robot:\n\nThe team decided on a side-by-side shooter rather than a top-bottom shooter after a moderately successful prototype and an unsuccessful top bottom one. It became clear through open alliance and our first event that the latter was significantly better. Unfortunately due to our trap mechanism design, a handoff from the shooter, we were unable to get the space needed for a top-bottom shooter (even though we were very capable of designing and manufacturing one) without sacrificing or needing to heavily modify our trap system. Even if we were able to have the space we likely would not have built one for other reasons (see below).\n\nOur team has previously been mechanically design and manufacture challenged, but that has changed in recent years due to mentorship and training. We’re now primarily software limited. The time taken away from our software team to develop automation, vision, autonomous, and other things due to the heavy mechanical needs of the trap was not at all worthwhile competitively. We didn’t have the resources for a development bot, and we had not successfully setup simulation, so when the programming team didn’t have the robot progress significantly slowed.\n\nEven after we agreed our best way to improve our robot was on the software side following our second event it was too late to get us up to speed. We attempted to implement path planner but didn’t have the programming chops to pull it off in the short time span we had. A lot of time was spent trying to get it to work, but that ended up being a significant sunk-cost and left very little time to try other automation/software improvements.\n\nAll this led up to a roughly 20% effective 3-note auto at our DCMP , something that put us behind in almost every match from the get-go, needing to be against the subwoffer to score notes in the speaker, and one of the best trap robots in the world.\n\nIn short, the trap was, in fact, a trap for our team.\n\nEdit: For some data-driven analysis, our endgame EPA was about 6.4. The highest in the world is 9.2 (Techno-Ticks). The lowest was -1. Even the best endgame team in the world only gained an advantage of 10 points on average over the worst in the endgame. That’s hardly anything in this game.\n\nCompare this with Auto points: the highest was just below 20 points and the lowest just below -1. Based on this, auto is statistically twice as impactful as endgame points and uses a similar amount of time in a match.\n\nAnd to Teleop: The best teams in the world were north of 30 point Teleop EPAs. Let’s call the worst zero. Teleop operation is worth 3X the points as the best endgame score, so it is comparably more important. This isn’t taking into account that teleop takes up more of the match time.\n\nObviously this is all in hindsight; we only have this data after all the competitions are over. The better strategic minds/teams predicted this and decided to put their limited units of effort into the most impactful areas. I’d argue this year saw the most success for teams who decided to bypass the endgame over any FRC game in the past. It was hardly necessary to rank well: 2056, 5895, 2910, 3005, and so many more are proof of this, even at the highest levels of competition.",
