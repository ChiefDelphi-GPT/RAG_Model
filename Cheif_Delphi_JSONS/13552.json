                    "cooked": "I recently put some time into designing and building a new swerve module, mostly for fun, but also as a learning exercise for myself. I’m pretty happy with the results. This post may get a bit long-winded in its discussion of the process, folks are welcome to skip to the end if they’d like.\n\nimage 807×837 99.4 KB\n\nimage 807×837 99.4 KB\n\nimage 807×837 99.4 KB\n\nThe main idea was to build a module that I could fund a drivebase for out of pocket, and that my team could use as a demo tool at outreach and recruiting events. The core of the experiment is a cheap module that can be run from an FTC ecosystem (REV expansion or control hub), and would be thus limited to 4 motors per drivebase. Using mostly 3dp parts, a custom thrust bearing, and the same m3 bolt for the majority of the hardware needs nets a quite affordable BoM, roughly 20 bucks per module without actuators (including filament needed). The with-actuator cost jumps up to around $113 when the motor, servo, and encoder are factored into the purchase.\n\nDrive is transmitted through a dual stage reduction, including a printed spur gear pair and a printed bevel gear pair. I haven’t had issues with the durability of these gears, mostly because the TPU tread and light drivebase don’t really make enough traction to cause the torque and shear load you’d need to break something. I would definitely switch to COTS gear options if this needed to be used on an actual robot, or any system that weighs much more than 30lbs, but a use case like that defies to the original intent anyway.\n\nimage 797×856 143 KB\n\nimage 797×856 143 KB\n\nimage 797×856 143 KB\n\nSteering is done by a continuous rotation servo, and monitored by a REV thru-bore encoder. A cam-actuated limit switch is included optionally for an absolute home.\n\nI wanted to experiment with new construction techniques, specifically with TPU belts for steering. The prototype module I built used this, but I’m not sure TPU belts are the solution: they tend to suffer from skipping and impractically high tension requirements. However, they do well as a cheap prototyping option. This module should also be able to accept a COTS 70t HTD belt, as a recourse.\n\nThis module also experiments with a custom dual thrust bearing (as shown in the cross-section above), using 6mm airsoft BBs. This is integrated into the upper and lower portions of the module, and is sandwiched together using m3 bolts. I’ve yet to build a module using the BBs; the prototype I built initially used 1/4\" Delrin balls from McMaster. The overall bearing concept seems quite solid though, and displayed pretty good lubricity even under high loads (from several directions). It’s definitely not as size efficient as an x-contact bearing or delrin bushing, but that’s to be expected.\n\nimage 1060×801 191 KB\n\nimage 1060×801 191 KB\n\nimage 1060×801 191 KB\n\nThis module has gone through 3 main iterations since it was first conceived, each focusing on making it cheaper and smaller. The final product could be made smaller still, but likely at the cost of cost; there’s a tradeoff.\n\nNotable iterations during the process include:\n\nAdapting to the servo output within the space constraints\n\nAdjusting belt size and belt tension\n\nAdjusting frame-mounting style\n\nAdjusting tread style, moved to a split wheel design to make tread installation + printing easier\n\nBelow are some pictures and videos from prototype module construction this summer.\n\nIMG-4906 720×652 108 KB IMG-4917 4032×3024 2.04 MB V1 Design featured a single-peice wheel as well as a different frame mounting solution\n\nIMG-4906 720×652 108 KB\n\nIMG-4906 720×652 108 KB\n\nIMG-4917 4032×3024 2.04 MB\n\nIMG-4917 4032×3024 2.04 MB\n\nPlaying with motion hot off the print-bed… swerve is cool!\n\nIMG-4921 4032×3024 2.15 MB IMG-4922 4032×3024 1.91 MB Ball bearing assembly shown\n\nIMG-4921 4032×3024 2.15 MB\n\nIMG-4921 4032×3024 2.15 MB\n\nIMG-4922 4032×3024 1.91 MB\n\nIMG-4922 4032×3024 1.91 MB\n\nIMG-4987 4032×3024 2.17 MB IMG_4989 3024×4032 1.96 MB Move to 2-peice wheel and dovetail tread connections\n\nIMG-4987 4032×3024 2.17 MB\n\nIMG-4987 4032×3024 2.17 MB\n\nIMG_4989 3024×4032 1.96 MB\n\nIMG_4989 3024×4032 1.96 MB\n\nIMG-4996 4032×3024 2.44 MB IMG-4997 4032×3024 2.46 MB Servo horn interface prototyping: featured cut down m3 bolts and a printed mating profile\n\nIMG-4996 4032×3024 2.44 MB\n\nIMG-4996 4032×3024 2.44 MB\n\nIMG-4997 4032×3024 2.46 MB\n\nIMG-4997 4032×3024 2.46 MB\n\nMotion testing w/o motor, pretty much as far as I got with V2 module testing\n\nI’m quite happy with how this design project went. I learned quite a bit, and plan to assemble a full drivebase with V3 modules for some software development… if I get a little free time this year.\n\nI’ve got a couple ideas for module improvements in the future:\n\nChange steering style to an internal ring gear, will help with module size and steering accuracy\n\nChange integrated bearing style to reduce module size (low priority, size isn’t a huge concern for me)\n\nPossibly replace captive nuts with heat-set inserts for greater strength and easier assembly/teardown\n\nAs a disclaimer, this module is not intended to be competition ready! This was purely an activity for me to get my feet wet actually building a swerve module design, and building some intuition for the challenges associated. I made this post to share the design and spark some discussion. If anyone wants to build this, they’re welcome to. It should be pretty accessible overall, especially if you already have some motors and encoders handy.\n\nThe CAD can be found here , and the BoM here . Questions and suggestions are welcome!\n\nOh, by the way, this module is yet un-christened: name suggestions are also welcome.",

The design looks fairly sound on first look (talk about a well detailed post), and the cost you just can’t beat.\n\nWe have some students and mentors on the team currently interested in pursuing swerve purely as a learning experience and because of the wow/fun factor. The cost isn’t something we’re prepared to eat right now, especially not knowing if our programming team is up to the challenge just yet (walk before we can run kinda deal). That being said however… after seeing this design, I’d be much more open and interested in building a small chassis running on a spare set of FRC electronics and these modules for our students to get their feet wet.\n\nOne question I had after looking at the BOM is, why did you elect to go with the Adafruit servo over a REV smart servo? Any practical reason, or was this merely a cost saving measure?\n\nOverall all, kudos to you for an impeccable design. Very impressive work!",

Would you create a routine during startup or by the press of a button to find the absolute home?\n\nI really like the idea of a super-cheap swerve designed specifically for students to experience it and practice coding.

Any practical reason, or was this merely a cost saving measure?\n\nThe main reason for this choice was cost and availability. Continuous rotation servos were pretty much the only actuator I’d actually have to order, and I wanted to keep the cost low. My understanding is that the REV smart robot servo can be used for continuous rotation as well, using the REV SRS Programmer.\n\nAgain, glad to hear your team is excited about the design!",

Is this an original idea?\n\nThis is something I came up with a while back, but it’s certainly been done before. @Bryce2471 ’s Compact Falcon Swerve post uses a similar idea for absolute zeroing.\n\nI haven’t put much thought into the control system yet, but I wanted to include an absolute limit as an option to compensate for brownouts or (more likely) belt skipping. This means the module would likely be zeroed with every activation of the limit switch, if that could be done in a way not too disruptive to driving smoothness.",

I recommend just buying a bunch in bulk, they’re way cheaper than I’ve found anywhere else and having them on-hand will allow you the freedom to use them all over on parts for your robot.\n\nFor reference, a pack of 500 10-32 inserts that will last you multiple seasons is $70, 0.14 per insert -\n\n10-32 Flanged Press Insert - Brass - 260-332-Br - Pkg Qty 500.

You may have to do a few test prints to get the hole sizes dialed in. For the knurled flanged ones that I often use, I just use a small arbor press or a pair of pliers to get them seated into my 3D printed parts. I know others just use a soldering iron for the heatset ones.\n\nDriving a bolt into the inserts expands them and makes it dig into the plastic even further. Thriftybot used them on the original vectored intake wheels (6-32 size) and I have been using the 10-32 ones a lot lately on the 3D Printed Quick Build Clamping Blocks\n\nimage 973×1297 324 KB\n\nimage 973×1297 324 KB\n\nimage 973×1297 324 KB\n\nThey really take 3D printed parts to the next level in my opinion.",

This is not to say ease of insertion isn’t a big advantage, not having to break out the soldering iron would be nice, but an arbor press sounds like it could be even less practical, potentially.\n\nAlso - Anyone have name ideas?",
