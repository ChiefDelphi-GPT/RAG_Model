But I don’t understand how\n\n(a) a microcontroller can tell the difference between each button being pressed? I initially thought about giving each button circuit a different resistance and measuring the voltage when pressed (since it completes the circuit), and based on that, deciding what button has been pressed. From my understanding of basic microcontrollers like an arduino, I’m pretty sure I can also put each button on a separate IO pin, but with this approach there is a limit to how many buttons I can use.\n\n(b) how do I communicate what buttons are being pressed with my roborio?\n\nI’m aware that there exists button boards that are somewhat off the shelf that will register as an xbox controller, but this feels like cheating and I think it won’t be as much of a learning experience.\n\nI’m somewhat of a novice when it comes to electronics, so I’d appreciate any help.",

It is typically the FRC Driver Station that communicates button presses from a usb device over to the rio.\n\nFor (a), It is often used as each button is on a separate digital IO pin, with joysticks and other analog devices being connected to analog IO pins. The concern about the limit to how many buttons you can use it often not a valid concern because the Driverstation from point (b) already has a limit to how many buttons can be used per USB device that is generally lower than the amount of digital IO pins on the microcontroller being used.\n\nAs far as what it shows up as in windows, I wouldn’t be overly concerned with that. If it shows up as a GenericHID or an XboxController or something else, just as long as the controller shows up as an HID Device, you should be fine. For many Arduino/Pi level of controllers, reducing it to the point where it shows up as an HID device will be the difficult part.",

Typically this is either by programming a micro-controller capable of running a USB Client Stack and emulating a Joystick/Gamepad, or using a purpose built USB Joystick Board such as the very accessible ones designed to connect up PC-based Arcade Cabinet style buttons/joysticks. This data is then accessible on the Robot same as any other Joystick data.\n\nFor the Latter, you have additional software running on the DriverStation Laptop that somehow reads/writes data to NetworkTables either directly or perhaps through a Plugin for Shuffleboard or some other Dashboard. The Robot can then also read/write to NetworkTables. This method is far more flexible, but I personally would not use this for any critical robot functionality if possible.\n\nI myself have previously brainstormed on a possible hybrid system that sends inputs primarily over the DriverStation, but is also able to read NetworkTables to display Robot Statuses or something using LEDs or a 7-seg display on a button board.",

Others have good suggestions above, I’ll add a few things.\n\n6328 uses one of these off-the-shelf arcade controller boards as the electronic interface for the override switches on our operator consoles .  (Scroll down a bit for a photo of the controller under the switches.)  These are great for switches/buttons but don’t offer analog inputs (as you’d need for joysticks), though you can find others that do have this.\n\nIf you want to DIY it, you typically want something that can emulate a USB joystick/game pad.  There’s a bunch of options, but a ATmega32u4 based Arduino like the “Leonardo” is an obvious possibility since it can directly emulate USB devices.  Given buttons and perhaps some external pull-up resistors, it’s pretty simple to read inputs.  The Cypress board that was (is?) included with the KoP for a while is also something I see teams using pretty often.\n\nDriving outputs is harder. When we experimented with a very fancy operator board , it presented a serial-over-USB interface for driving its outputs (plus 2 emulating 2 joysticks in order to support enough buttons), and we ran a custom Python script on the driver station laptop that read state from NetworkTables and sent custom serial commands to the Leonardo that controlled the board.\n\nAnything handling driver/operator input needs to be rock solid since it’s critical to successful match play.  Make sure whatever you do is carefully built and thoroughly tested so the drive team has confidence in it.",
