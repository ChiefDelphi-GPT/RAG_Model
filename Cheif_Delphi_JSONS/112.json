When the camera is right against the tag and it's in full view, it cuts in and out like it's unsure if it sees it. Also, the camera stream is really laggy. I was reading over the docs for something I missed but didn't find anything. We have an OV9281 ArduCam with an Orange Pi 5 and we run it off a mobile battery onboard the robot. Thanks for reading over my problems.\n\nI think this captures everything. Let me check:\n- Removed all HTML tags.\n- Fixed grammar where necessary (e.g., \"it's\" vs. \"its\").\n- Made sure the flow makes sense without line breaks.\n- Kept the technical details intact because they're important for understanding the issue.\n- Used standard punctuation at the end of sentences.\nLooks good!\n```\n\nThe user wants to clean up their text, so I need to remove HTML tags and unnecessary stuff while keeping the meaning. First, I'll take out the `<p>` tag since that's just formatting. Then, look for any other tags or unwanted elements, but in this case, there are none. Next, I'll check the grammar. Words like \"it's\" should be correct, which they are. I also need to ensure the sentence flow is smooth. The original message seems okay, but I'll read through it again to make sure. \n\nThe technical details about the camera model and hardware are important, so I shouldn't remove those. I should keep them intact for clarity. Punctuation at the end of sentences needs standardization, so I'll add periods where missing. Finally, I'll combine everything into one paragraph without line breaks as the user requested. That should do it.\n```",

                    "cooked": "The camera cutting in and out when directly aligned with the tag in full view likely stems from autofocus challenges. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n1. **Autofocus Issues**: \n   - The camera may struggle to maintain focus when the tag moves rapidly, causing brief periods of blur. Slow focus response times exacerbate this problem.\n\n2. **Motion Factors**:\n   - Rapid movement of the tag across the frame can stress the camera's ability to keep focus, leading to frequent focus shifts.\n\n3. **Camera Settings**:\n   - Adjustments in focus settings, such as slow focus speed, might hinder the camera's ability to adapt quickly, resulting in momentary losses of focus.\n\n4. **Firmware or Software Bugs**:\n   - Potential software glitches could interfere with the camera's processing, affecting its ability to handle dynamic focus changes effectively.\n\n5. **Physical Obstructions**:\n   - Minute obstructions, despite the tag being in full view, might cause temporary interruptions in focus.\n\n6. **Video Compression**:\n   - The camera's compression algorithms may not handle quick focus adjustments smoothly, introducing artifacts that simulate image cutoffs.\n\n**Diagnosis and Solutions**:\n- **Check Focus Modes**: Ensure the camera is set to continuous autofocus and evaluate focus response times.\n- **Inspect for Obstructions**: Look for debris or physical barriers near the camera and tag.\n- **Test Movement and Stationarity**: Assess video quality when the tag is static versus moving.\n- **Examine Video Quality**: Investigate compression artifacts or processing delays that might contribute to the issue.\n- **Update Firmware**: Check for updates and test after installation to rule out software issues.\n- **Consult Support**: Engage with technical support or forums for insights and solutions specific to this problem.\n\nBy systematically addressing each factor, the root cause of the camera's intermittent focus issues can be identified and resolved.",
