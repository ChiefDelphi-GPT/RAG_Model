I put a camera feed to look at but then realized that I never really used it during matches. What information do you all have for your drive team on Smart Dashboard (Or its variants)?\n\nAdditionally, our coach was wondering whether we could put a live feed of scoring status during the match so they don’t have to look around to see what is scored. I was thinking if we can somehow access the FMS as the scorers input the information onto a tablet, but that might not be possible.

(I know the answer has been no since at least 2017, but no one has had spare time to even look into it???)\n\nThere are events (especially districts) where live scoring is visible by one alliance looking forward, and the other has to turn around to see the live scoring. It does create somewhat of a competitive advantage for some teams.\n\nThink worlds last year, you had to look up at that narrow bottom screen, good luck to the center alliance seeing it.\n\nA compromise I’ve seen at some events is they have a TV at each driver station edge to make easy viewing of the live scoring. Another option is FIM fields now have a tablet in the center drive station showing FMS stats during robot connection before a match, maybe it can switch to live scoring data during a match.",

As with most things, I expect it boils down to priorities and resources.  My understanding is that it is complicated by the architecture of FMS, i.e. FMS separates the scoring / display stuff from the robot control side.  Given the news that there has been volunteer involvement in FMS development this fall (I believe to help implement the new playoff structure?), I’m hopeful that additional resources can be brought to bear for other features as well.\n\nThe TV screens to balance scoring display visibility from both alliances should be an easier ask—I expect the video hardware has enough outputs, so it’s mainly a question of having the screen available and running the cable.",
