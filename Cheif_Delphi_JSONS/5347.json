However, Akit automatically records PDP status, including current drawn, battery voltage, and energy used.  So I’m wondering if it’s possible to analyze the battery using the logs.\n\nHas anyone done this before?  Is there an existing tool I can use?  Any thoughts/suggestions are greatly appreciated!",

You would probably need a battery analyzer to tune the readings anyway.\n\nI recommend just saving the cash for a real analyzer. If you wanted you could then come back to this idea with known good data to compare to. Even then i would use it only as a day to day indicator of when to retest properly.\n\nIn the short term finding a nearby team or company with one would be the easiest way.",

We put ours into a plastic box with a clear lid since it comes as a PCB. We installed some small momentary push buttons on the lid of the box and soldered the wires so they were in parallel with the buttons on the board.

I bet it isnt exactly.  you could also look at individual motor current and motor voltage, and make similar charts.  are the individual motor voltages the same as the “bus” voltage? I bet they’re not the same.  why not?\n\nif you publish a few of your charts here on CD with a note explaining what you did, I bet you’d get a lot of folks interested in it.

The PDP of 9 years ago was decent at providing voltage and current, but we saw a lot of noise in the signals. You’d want to quantify that first under some specific tests to understand your noise floor on measurements in 2025+ before deciding to (or not to) do this.\n\nSecond, Good battery testers (“model parameter extractors”?) will sample the battery’s operation at multiple, stable testpoints.\n\nRobots eat the battery at all sorts of random rates. A lot of the weird logic we had was to detect windows of time that were good, representative current/voltage pairs we could fit a model to.\n\nNine years ago, the amount of averaging we had to do on our sensor data was pretty massive. We probably only really got two or three useful bits of information out of it (think, “Great”, “Good”, “Meh”, “Bad”, not actual model parameters). Still, that was useful for our purposes of picking limits on how much current to pull from the battery to prevent brownout. YMMV based on what you actually wanna to use your data for, though.\n\ntruher:\n\ntell you something about the health of the battery and the wiring .\n\nIndeed, this is what we measured. The inclusion of the wiring in our model was a happy, desirable outcome given our use case. But again, YMMV based on what you want to do with the information.",

A “typical” FRC test might use a constant load in the range of 7-8A.  You will be able to chart how long it takes for the voltage to drop to 10.5v, and be able to generate useful comparative graphs of good and bad batteries, and that’s all you can do with an analyzer anyway. You can get more sophisticated with a boost converter to ensure constant voltage to the load,  it for comparative purposes I do t think it’s necessary.  Make sure your load doesn’t overheat. The pdh can provide more data than the analyzer, including current draw. You could do it all on a test board setup and code it to stop at a cut off voltage.  I don’t think the analyzer measures internal resistance.  We use a separate tool (Battery Beak) for that.",
