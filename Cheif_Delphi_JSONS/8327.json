I got it to work on our robot that we made in the offseason which is almost the exact same setup except the new bot has a CANivore, Roborio 2 instead of 1, and 2 of the motors are flipped (which is being handled in the code). I’ve updated the devices firmwares several times, reimaged the roborio, and swapped our canivore for a different one we had.\n\nThe specific problem I’m having is that whenever the steer motors are ran, they start spasming and going crazy. When calibrating it with the swerve generator, the steering test worked perfectly fine and the driving test worked only when the wheels were already rotated to 0 heading. All of this makes me assume that it’s something with the closed loop mode but I can’t seem to figure out what the problem is.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated",

In the steering test, all swerve modules should rotate counter-clockwise , as seen from the top of the robot. Additionally, CANcoder position should increase as the modules spin counter-clockwise.\n\nIf your modules are flipped, the CANcoders are likely still correct, but the swerve modules probably rotated clockwise instead of counter-clockwise. If you press “No” when asked if they all spun the correct direction, then we invert the steer motors so you can test again.\n\nSince you already generated a project, you should be able to change kSteerMotorReversed to change the invert of the steer motors.",

Another interesting thing I noticed was when in the swerve generator and the robot was enabled, if any wheel was rotated, the amount of resistance the motor was outputting was not consistent. When the wheel was facing around 0 degrees, there was almost no motor resistance and when it was 180, there was much more motor resistance. I’m not sure if this is expected or not, just something I observed. During the steer test, the drive motors were also running at a constant speed. Based on this, I’m assuming it’s a problem with the PID values.",

When calibrating it with the swerve generator, the steering test worked perfectly fine and the driving test worked only when the wheels were already rotated to 0 heading. All of this makes me assume that it’s something with the closed loop mode but I can’t seem to figure out what the problem is.\n\nWe experienced the same behavior during our last meeting ( SDS MK4is, Krakens).  Everything worked perfectly aside from the “rotate module to 0 degrees” part of the drive test. Sometimes it would work, sometimes a module would violently oscillate around the setpoint and then overshoot off to some random angle before enabling the throttle motors.\n\nWe opted to just use the drive test to check throttle motor inversion and call it a day. One guess as to this behavior is that the default PID gains generated assume that you have Phoenix Pro licensed and we didn’t have the licenses applied at the time, so the gains may have been a little aggressive for the system. Applying the license and actually driving around is on the docket for today’s meeting.",

One is steer and one is drive, both on the front of the robot. When I went into the TunerConstants file to flip the steer motor, I did .withSteerMotorInverted(true) . Since we have Mk4i’s, all of the steer motors already needed to be inverted so when I set the motor inversion to true, it wasn’t doing anything. The fix was to set it to false.\n\nI definitely should’ve caught this sooner but I’m glad it wasn’t something bigger like a dysfunctional part.",
