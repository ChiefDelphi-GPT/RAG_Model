                    "cooked": "Hall of Fame Team 1114 Simbotics is excited to release the CAD model of our 2025 robot, Simbot Suzuki.  \n\nThis season, one of our goals was to field a competitive robot at our first competition with smaller adjustments instead of major overhauls like last year. We decided to prioritize performance over features such as the deep climb, ground algae, and floor coral.  \n\nAt our first competition in Niagara College, we achieved a 7-5 record and secured 4th place overall. We were chosen as the 2nd seed by Alliance #2200 and advanced through the playoffs all the way to Match 13. Unfortunately, we lost the position of our manipulator after encountering a reef branch while lowering the elevator during the L4 coral placement. Despite this setback, we appreciated our alliance partners 2200 and 7757 for their support and making the competition enjoyable.  \n\nBetween events, we focused on fixing issues like manipulator positioning, intake jams, and driver and programmer training while developing a deep cage climber. Our biggest challenge was the elevator and funnel placement; we realized the center of gravity was blocking the cage. After careful consideration, we found a solution by angling the funnel downward and inserting the cage from the side, even though moving the funnel risked affecting coral intake.  \n\nWe successfully designed, built, and integrated the deep climber in time for the McMaster District event. Testing revealed some plate failures during qualification rounds, but we adapted quickly and fixed the issue before the playoffs. We climbed successfully in most elimination matches, breaking our previous streak of losing in Match 13 and reaching the finals. We thank teams 1241 for selecting us and 6865 for their excellent partnership in the alliance.  \n\nAt Provincials, we brought an improved climber and climbed effectively in many matches. Our main challenge became the chain sometimes aligning incorrectly, causing the bumpers to hit the ground and disqualifying climbs. As the 4th alliance captain, we partnered with teams 610 and 772 for another strong playoff run, only to be eliminated by Alliance #2 in Match 13.  \n\nAt Worlds, we maintained the same configuration, confident in our robot and division. We won most qualification matches but lost some points due to climbing issues, finishing 6th overall. We formed our own alliance with teams 2052, 1701, and 839 and made another impressive run to the semifinals—again falling in Match 13 against a powerful 4th seed.  \n\nHere’s the link to our CAD design: [CAD Model](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/…).  \n\nThank you to everyone who supported us: our students, mentors, volunteers, parents, sponsors including GM, Barlow Manufacturing, GoBeyond Group, the Rotary Club of Niagara-on-the-Lake, West Coast Products, Ontario Power Generation, District School Board of Niagara, Governor Simcoe Secondary School, Walls-by-Walls, E.S. Fox Ltd., and others. If you have questions about the robot or our strategies, feel free to ask!",

The Lexan piece shown in the design was not installed because we felt it wasn’t necessary. Instead, the energy chain is supported by three aluminum brackets, which were intended to mount the Lexan piece. This setup worked well, and including the energy chain in the design, something we usually avoid, was particularly helpful. It allowed us to achieve a reliable energy chain free of issues throughout the season. Thanks for your questions!",

Instead, we focused our efforts on enhancing the loading station coral, creating prototypes for its mechanical system. Our priority list was organized as follows:\n\n1. Drive Maneuverability (Swerve)  \n2. Intake from Loading Station  \n3. L4 Coral  \n4. Remove Algae from Reef  \n5. L3 Coral  \n6. L2 Coral  \n7. L1 Coral  \n8. Deep Climb (Ignored until after Niagara College)  \n9. Processor from Reef  \n10. Barge Algae  \n11. Intake algae from the floor  \n12. Intake coral from the floor  \n\nSome features, like the deep climb, were delayed until later in the season, and we initially prioritized simpler additions, such as the algae removal mechanism, over more complex ones. We also deprioritized tasks like collecting algae and coral from the ground. If I had the chance to change something, I would have included the ability to pick up algae from the floor earlier, as this could have simplified our process later on. Thank you for your question!",
