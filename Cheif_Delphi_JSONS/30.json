                    "cooked": "Hall of Fame Team 1114 Simbotics is excited to release the CAD model of our 2025 robot, Simbot Suzuki .\n\nSeason Recap\n\nThis year, one of our goals was to come out strong with a competitive robot at our first competition, making smaller adjustments throughout the season rather than doing a major overhaul like last year. This goal was a key reason we chose to ignore the deep climb (at least early on), the ground algae, and the floor coral.\n\nAt our first competition, Niagara College, we finished with a 7-5 record and ranked 4th overall. We were picked by Alliance #2 captain, Team 2200, and made a strong playoff run all the way to Match 13. In that match, we lost the position of our manipulator after catching the reef branch while lowering the elevator after placing an L4 coral. We ended up losing to a strong third alliance. Huge thanks to 2200 and 7757 for being awesome alliance partners and making it a fun event!\n\nDuring our break between events, we focused on addressing the small issues we encountered (manipulator positioning, intake jams, driver practice, programming improvements, etc.) and also aimed to add a deep cage climber. The biggest challenge here was the position of our elevator and funnel—we hadn’t left enough room between them for the cage, and the centre of gravity was right in between. After lots of discussion and ideation, we figured out a way to pivot the funnel down and bring the cage in from the side, twisting it into the robot. Moving the funnel wasn’t ideal—we worried it might impact our coral intake—but it was the only solution we could come up with to make deep climbing work.\n\nWe managed to design, build, and mount the deep climber just in time for the McMaster District event. During qualifications, we tested and improved it, but only managed one successful climb before some plates broke. Usually, we have time to test new subsystems before events, but this time we had to learn and iterate during the event. We replacedthe plates in time for the playoffs, and climbed successfully in most elimination matches. We finally made it past our usual Match 13 curse and reached the finals, where we eventually lost. Big thanks to our friends at 1241 for picking us, and to 6865 for being a great alliance partner.\n\nAt Provincials, we came in with an improved climber and were able to climb in many matches. The main issue now was the chain occasionally being on the “wrong side.” When that happened, the chain would be further from the centre of gravity, so our bumpers would touch the ground, and the climb wouldn’t count. As the 4th alliance captain, we selected 610 and 772 to form a strong alliance. Together, we had another great playoff run and were once again knocked out in Match 13—this time by a very strong Alliance #2 .\n\nAt the World Championship, we competed with the same configuration as Provincials and felt confident in both our robot and our division. We won all but two of our qualification matches, but due to some climbing issues, we dropped a few ranking points and ended up 6th overall. We formed our own alliance, picking up 2052, 1701, and 839. Once again, we had an awesome elimination run that ended in—you guessed it—Match 13, where we were defeated by a very powerful 4th alliance.\n\nHere’s the link to our OnShape Design:\n\nSign in to Onshape, the #1 fastest growing CAD system in the world with over 4 million users.\n\nThank you to everyone who made this season possible—our amazing students, mentors, volunteers, parents, and sponsors: General Motors, Barlow Manufacturing, GoBeyond Group, the Rotary Club of Niagara-on-the-Lake, West Coast Products, Ontario Power Generation, the District School Board of Niagara, Governor Simcoe Secondary School, Walls-by-Walls, E.S.

Instead, the energy chain is being supported by the 3 aluminium brackets that the Lexan piece was supposed to mount to. It worked very well, and designing in the energy chain (which we don’t normally do) was very helpful and allowed us to have a great working energy chain that didn’t have flaws throughout the season.\n\nThanks for the questions!",

Instead, loading station coral was our higher priority, so we only worked on prototypes for this mechanism of the robot.\n\nOur priority list looked like this:\n\nDrive Maneuverability (Swerve)\n\nIntake from Loading Station\n\nL4 Coral\n\nRemove Algae from Reef\n\nL3 Coral\n\nL2 Coral\n\nL1 Coral\n\nDeep Climb Ignored until after Niagara College\n\nProcessor from Reef\n\nBarge Algae\n\nIntake algae from the floor\n\nIntake coral from the floor\n\nOur robot abilities changed a bit from the priorities because some parts were easy to add without complicating the robot, such as adding the algae mechanism before adding the deep climber, and some things were ignored such as algae and coral from the ground.\n\nIf I were to change something, though, I would add the ability to pick up algae off the floor because we could have done some simple changes early on that would have allowed us to do this, but these changes would have been very significant later in the season.\n\nThanks for the question!",
