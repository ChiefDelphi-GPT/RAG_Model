                    "cooked": "You don’t really need a command for your differential drive, differential drive is simple enough that it can just be a method which is where the run command comes in, however if you want to apply some things like slew limiting, it might be cleaner to implement it in a command. In the command you are need to pass a drive subsystem into its constructor and store the DriveTrain that gets passed in the class.\n\nTo get this to run you would then need to import this command into RobotContainer and set the default command for the DriveTrain subsystem. It is the only place you should specify a default command until you are very familiar with how the command based system works. It would look like this.\n\nSomething to note as you are fleshing out your code, it is easier to read code when you name classes like driveSubsystem, or tankDriveCommand. It may help you keep track of what is happening because you have the tankDrive method and the tankDriveCommand.\n\nedit: Also you need to call the tankDrive method from the object m_driveTrain in the execute method of the command. You will also need to pass in and store a DoubleSupplier into tankDrive command. These do not need to go in the addRequirements function. Then in execute you would pass the values in by calling the getAsDouble() function on the double suppliers. In RobotContainer the constructor would need to look like this:\n\nAs I said earlier lambdas are basically just functions you can store. The parenthesis store arguments of lambda, so they are empty because the functions don’t need any arguments. The → basically just points towards the function body.",
