                    "cooked": "Posting what I got Now as IDK how much time I will have working on this with the season starting. In the past I posted multiple gearboxes which seem to run fine - BUT will/would they last a season. So I started on a quest to get some definite answers. Right now this is a straight forward 28:1ish gearbox using standard gears. the gears are double helical involute with a 14.5 deg pressure angle and a 1.5 mm modulus. Why 1.5mm - well it worked for us well in the past never pulled a tooth not on HIPS and not on Nylon and its about the smallest tooth size that will print well and fast with a .8 nozzle and still have enough accuracy to do a little filet and crowning on the top IOW produce smooth running gears. At some point I will go with smaller nozzles down in module/pitch to find out the minimum module/pitch for a particular gear at a particular rpm made from a particular material with or without lube. 20220104_1127021 2604×4624 1.68 MB This is one of the gears with a 688 bearing on each side. The initial 2 stages have 688 bearings cause they are quite sufficient to carry the load only the final output stage has 2 608 (rollerskate) bearings. their static rating each is a little more than 2 robots so strong enough 20220104_1144551 2604×4624 1.99 MB A look at the last stage with and 18 tooth HTD 5 pulley on it. Now I will not use a looped belt but an open one which allows for greater distance. In the past robot max height was in the 3 to 6 foot range at startup so all climbers are/will be designed to use an open belt as they do not have to run continuously but to extend a “stick” with a hook and then hool it and then “reel it back in” to perform the climb The cross plate with the many holes allows mounting of most limit switches we use pointing all kinds of ways or maybe getting extended with a limit switch bracket if necessary. So atm plenty of holes to moung some type of limit switch 20220104_1144141 2604×4624 1.14 MB Showing the last 2 stages mounted 20220104_1205431 2604×4624 1.92 MB all 3 stages 20220104_1206351 2604×4624 2.67 MB And the input pinion in this pic just held there by hand- but will be mounted to the output shaft of a CIM\n\n20220104_1127021 2604×4624 1.68 MB\n\n20220104_1127021 2604×4624 1.68 MB\n\n20220104_1144551 2604×4624 1.99 MB\n\n20220104_1144551 2604×4624 1.99 MB\n\n20220104_1144141 2604×4624 1.14 MB\n\n20220104_1144141 2604×4624 1.14 MB\n\n20220104_1205431 2604×4624 1.92 MB\n\n20220104_1205431 2604×4624 1.92 MB\n\n20220104_1206351 2604×4624 2.67 MB\n\n20220104_1206351 2604×4624 2.67 MB\n\nThis gearbox could be used to lift a robot but will be in this case used to put a load onto another gearbox to be tested\n\nThe rough math is. A CIM will put out about 5 in/lb at 36-34 Amps. We need to stay under the 40 A max breakers per motor that FIRST has in the rules Even though stall torque is more than 2x that we cant get there due to wiring, current rules and it would also not make much sense due to heat creation and the possibility to set the motor or a controller on fire etc. So 5 * 28 gives about 140 in/lb of torque on the output. An 18 tooth HTD-5 pulley has a pitch diameter of 5 * 18 / PI = about 30ish mm and a radius of about 15 Which should allow us to lift something close to almost 200 lb so more than 1 robot or a robot with some safety net in regard to Amperage. You should expect close to 4k rmp out of the CIM or about 140 on the output which with the pulley should translate into something like 6-9 in/sec depending on efficiency. Probably closer to 6 in/sec for a heavyweight (at max weight) robot.\n\nBut plenty to simulate a 150is lb load in a tug of war with another gearbox. In this case where the other - to be tested gearbox back drives this gearbox - this gearbox will be using the motor as a “break” to simulate the weight. This will be done in 2 ways by either intermittend breaking or even running the motor in “reverse” at a speed that will produce the load. I am working on a specialized set of motor controllers for that. One potentially could use a roborio and 2 talons etc but this is a low cost operation .\n\nThe contraption will be mounted on top of about a 6-7 ft tower with the gearbox to be tested on the bottom. The open belt will initially have its end connected to a fish scale to determine the Amps/weight ratio. CIMs behave close enough to torque motors and are inexpensive enough. I am trying to get some data regarding “is it going to work on a robot” and not to create data down to the milligram\n\nFor framing I use our 05F environment here are some pics 20220104_1209221 2604×4624 1.74 MB The square holes take 1/2 in square 16 gauge tubing. On the robot we usually use aluminum but for this I use steel as that is what was on sale and I am not that worried about weight on this one. the holes take M5 bolts and there are 2 rows in most places to allow the steel/aluminum tubing to cross and the M5 bolt to go through both crossing members 20220104_1216041 2604×4624 2.26 MB Here is an example of a hole placed at an intersection where a M5 bolt will be used to tie the plastic and 2 steel tubes together.\n\n20220104_1209221 2604×4624 1.74 MB\n\n20220104_1209221 2604×4624 1.74 MB\n\n20220104_1216041 2604×4624 2.26 MB\n\n20220104_1216041 2604×4624 2.26 MB\n\nThe whole gear box including  bolt axles (5/16 bolts - I got a lot and they are almost dead on for 8mm bearings) is a little over 2lb\n\nAnd for this prototype/tester - all white prints are HIPS - the blue is PETG",
