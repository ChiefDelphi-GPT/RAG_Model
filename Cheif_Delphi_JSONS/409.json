We used it this year and I liked the built-in simulation and high-frequency odometry the most.\n\nHow is the control, currently we have drive states like MANUAL, PATHFOLLOWING, SEMIAUTO will I lose this kind of control?(wrapper class could fix this?)\n\nIn the swerve API you have “swerve requests”, which are kinda similar to the control requests for Phoenix 6 devices. So you can have multiple different ‘modes’ of controlling your swerve drive, in a sense.\n\nYou probably have heard many reasons to switch, so as you asked, here are a few not to:\n\nCTRE device requirement: If you do something like break your only Pigeon 2 gyro, you can’t replace it with another gyro model (which would be possible to change with custom swerve code)\n\nIf you like looking through and understanding or referencing the code, the entire implementation is in C++ with the Java layer just being a JNI wrapper. Most of it is in public header files that you can find on CTRE ’s documentation, but a few methods do not have public source code.\n\nRelated to the last point: the swerve API is flexible and will fit most teams’ needs, but there are a few areas where you can’t really innovate. For example, if you wanted to have broken swerve modules automatically remove themselves during the match, you couldn’t really do that (although this is not worth spending time on implementing). Another thing is log replay: CTRE has their own log replay but it isn’t fully deterministic like AdvantageKit (see Comparison of Log Replay Tools | AdvantageKit for more details)\n\nAnother thing is log replay: CTRE has their own log replay but it isn’t fully deterministic like AdvantageKit (see Comparison of Log Replay Tools | AdvantageKit for more details)\n\nYou cannot use LabVIEW with it (should this be considered a benefit?)\n\nAnyways, these reasons are pretty minor, so I think using CTRE swerve is almost always the right choice for teams who are already on the hardware.",

Not to mention the AWESOME support from CTRE .\n\nSo my recommendation is use their swerve code and find other places to innovate with your robot. I don’t think the juice is worth the squeeze.

This is because through Tuner X’s swerve project generator you get walked step by step through how to create your swerve drive. Then you can copy a generated file into one of CTREs examples or use the generated project from Tuner and boom, you have teleop driving. Run a couple characterization routines (conveniently provided in the generated and example projects) and setup your path generation software of choice, you get path following as well. Not only do you get baseline performance from this you get basically anything you’d expect from a top tier swerve codebase, high frequency odometry, simulation you name it. and it just works . I’ve seen the AdvantageKit swerve templates recommended in this thread and while its a great resource I don’t think we should be pushing teams towards AdvantageKit unnecessarily. It’s a replay framework not a swerve library. If you want a swerve library CTRE has a top tier option, if you decide that you would benefit from replay, then you should consider the AdvantageKit templates but that is a seperate matter and should be viewed as such since AdvantageKit forces you to make a variety of tradeoffs in order to achieve deterministic replay.",

This answer maximizes their success. And I will continue to advise teams to not roll their own solutions.\n\nIf you are in the top x% that need more power/control and different use cases than the established middleware…you usually aren’t the one asking. You have an informed opinion that’s backed up by sufficient resources to implement it.\n\nI use similar language in my profession in regards to middlware",

                    "cooked": "We switched to it this year and loved it. Made a few small modifications, mostly just messing with the inputs off the controllers to get things how we like it and adding some more telemetry. As others have pointed out there is a lot to like with it. Some of the logic moved down into a native layer which likely avoids context switches in java etc.\n\nFrom a learning standpoint: Its great to understand how Swerve works and nothing wrong with letting students get the experience of actually writing it as well. In 2023 we used a modified version of 1678’s swerve implementation. In 2024 we used the 254 setpoint generator style. All were good.\n\nSwerve code in general dosen’t have to be that complicated. Its not far fetched to write your own if you want to. You can choose where to leverage things (WPIlib has a lot of functions, use your motor controllers onboard pid loops, etc. ) and retain a lot of control if you want to.\n\nFrom a competitive standpoint: What stuck out to me was the feedback last season from one of the mentors of 254 themself in the WPI feedback thread: 2024 WPILib Feedback - #134 by Jared_Russell\n\nBasically, talking about how 254 made an effort to embrace more of the community solutions.  This is 254, the team that has brought a lot of the modern software concepts into this world to begin with. We also made the effort the following season following suit to try to embrace open source software more, use software others have spent time getting to work and use our team to build up other capabilities. This past season it allowed us to pour more time into Automation and characterizing mechanisms such as our elevator + wrist mechanisms. Not having to deal with drive code changes, or vision code changes (we went back to photonvision this year after using  a homegrown system prior) bought so much time to do other things.",
