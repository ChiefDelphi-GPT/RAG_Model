                    "cooked": "Recently, I purchased a Romi to use as a learning experience to dive deep into FRC Path Following. It was probably the best money I’ve ever spent toward FIRST. Just gonna outline some of my experiences here.\n\nThis is sooooo incredibly critical! If you cannot write a basic java program that allows you to control the robot with joysticks, step back and focus on that for a bit. While the “Path Following” code itself looks copy/pastable, you need to understand what’s going on. Debugging is incredibly critical here.\n\nI first programmed my Romi to use my controller, and then chased after my cat. A very amusing and fun experience.\n\nI consider myself having a pretty moderate level of programming experience. There are many many things that can go wrong with path following. It’s incredibly easy to think one this is the issue, and break others in the process of fixing that.\n\nThis project by ZQ which allows for Romi trajectory tracking has been fantastic (soon available for frc-char replacement SysID). However, there were a couple of pain points.\n\nBe very very careful with your units. Meters everything, meters always. Do not convert later, you will step on a nail here.\n\nI initially forgot to enter my units per rotation (0.219915) and that took me several hours to debug later on. Do it right first.\n\nFor those interested, this is my Romi Characterization (2.8 MB).\n\nOh yeah, before I forget, as noted in ZQs characterization README, it’s quite important to put the velocity threshold quite low. I put (0.050) for mine.\n\nDisclaimer : While Romis are “identical”, I got quite different characterization results than ZQs data did. As a test, I used his and mine. While his data tracked “okay”, I got much much better results using my own data, and tuning that.\n\nSend your robot Pose2D to Field2D, it’ll make debugging immensely easier\n\nPlot your trajectory onto the dashboard, this will eliminate any concerns that the trajectory itself is wrong.\n\nPlot current wheel speeds versus expected wheel speeds, this will help debugging it not following a smooth path (I did before and after Ramsete wheel speeds)\n\nBe very careful with inversions. Only ever invert in one place (I recommend your inputs), to keep things consistent. Inversions can very quickly lead you into a rabbit hole.\n\nStart off with a straight line trajectory, make sure it follows it reasonable well (you’re odometry is accurate)\n\nMove toward a curve, verify it follows the curve reasonable well (this is where the inversions can really get tricky).\n\nDo not skip steps! This takes time to learn!\n\nZQ Characterization Project: https://github.com/bb-frc-workshops/romi-examples/tree/main/romi-characterization\n\nUsed as a baseline to debug any characterization issues\n\nZQ Ramsete Project: https://github.com/bb-frc-workshops/romi-examples/tree/main/romi-trajectory-ramsete\n\nUsed as a reference to determine any inversion issues or code issues.\n\nCharacterization Documentation: https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/wpilib-tools/robot-characterization/index.html\n\nUsed to understand the inputs and outputs, this is very important since you can’t compare data on an actual robot.\n\nPath Planning Documentation: https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/examples-tutorials/trajectory-tutorial/index.html\n\nMeat and bones of the tutorial\n\nTroubleshooting Path Planning: Troubleshooting — FIRST Robotics Competition documentation\n\nThis article was so useful for debugging why my Romi’s tracking was doodoo.\n\nNon-Commandbased Ramsete Example: https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/tree/main/wpilibjExamples/src/main/java/edu/wpi/first/wpilibj/examples/ramsetecontroller\n\nI did non-commandbased for my romi project, and used this as another reference.\n\nRomi Code: GitHub - Daltz333/Romi_Traj_Following\n\nThen… the same day I got the above path nice and cleaned up, I went to try it on an actual robot…\n\nIn a session of two hours, I characterized and programmed my robot to follow the barrel racing path using the knowledge and debugging steps from the Romi. This wasn’t without flaws. I prepared the robot project by using previous robot code as a baseline (already had sensor logic for velocity/distance, gyro, and motor ids). Then, at home, I threw together it in simulation to verify my robot code logic was accurated.\n\nThen, in only a two hour timespan, I characterized my robot and plugged those in to my already created robot code. I did have some motor inversion issues to work out due to simulation inversions differing from real life. Additionally, my math for inches to meters was wrong for some dumb reason I have yet to figure out (I copied CTREs native to meters example code).\n\nRobot Code: https://github.com/Daltz333/CTRE_Trajectory_Following\n\nOverall… just another Romi success story.",

As far as simulation can get you (and as much of a quantum leap as it was), there was historically still a gap of the skillset of “getting on hardware”. This is very clear evidence to me that the gap is getting filled in quite effectively.\n\nIt’s awesome because all the things you mentioned are my historical pain-points when going from sim to hardware. The fact you were able to do your learning on a small-ish, mostly-idealized platform and then rip through it fast on the real robot is a very powerful tool indeed.",
