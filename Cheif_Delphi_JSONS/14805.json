                    "cooked": "Over the past few years there have been a few discussions here about DifferentialDrive... Output not updated often enough errors . Sometimes they are the result of programming mistakes; sometimes they seem more fundamental.\n\nFor example consider the following situation. I want to run a driving command that drives until a specific condition is achieved (for example, reaching the end of a trajectory). Simultaneously I want to aim a turret. The time taken for both of these commands is unknown. I have a default command for the DifferentialDrive subsystem that causes it to stop in the absence of operator joystick input; and MotorSafety is enabled on the DifferentialDrive subsystem.\n\nLet’s name a few things: NormalDriving – the default drivebase Command; never finishes; feeds 0 to motors in absence of driver input. DriveTrajectory – a Command that drives the trajectory; finishes when the end of the trajectory is reached; requires drivebase AimTurret – the Command that aims the turret; finishes when the turret is aimed; requires turret PCG - ParallelCommandGroup, SCG - SequentialCommandGroup, PRG - ParallelRaceGroup\n\nHow do I do DriveTrajectory and AimTurret simultaneously? I put them in a parallel command group, right?\n\ndoBothCommand1 is a command that requires the turret and the drivebase and ends when both commands’ finish conditions have been met. Unfortunately, it is also a command that leaves the drivebase watchdog unfed if the DriveTrajectory command ends before the AimTurret command does: because doBothCommand1 is the scheduled command for the drivebase until AimTurret finishes, DriveNormal (the drivebase’s default command) does not get scheduled on the Drivebase. And so, a DifferentialDrive... Output not updated often enough error occurs. If I were to enable MotorSafety for the turret subsystem, it would pretty much be guaranteed that I would get Output not updated often enough for one subsystem or the other whenever I ran doBothCommand1 .\n\nSo how can this be avoided (assuming I’m not willing to disable MotorSafety for the drivebase)? I apparently need to put a NormalDriving command after the DriveTrajectory . So let’s consider\n\ndoBothCommand2 doesn’t cause an Output not updated often enough error; but it also doesn’t work – since DriveNormal never finishes, the parallel command group never finishes.\n\nHow about\n\nThat works if AimTurret takes longer than DriveTrajectory , but does not work if DriveTrajectory takes longer (driving is interrupted before reaching the destination).\n\nSo, am I missing something obvious from the (new) Command framework that would let me solve this problem? And if not, what additional/different functionality could be made part of the Command framework to provide a solution for this, I believe fairly common, use case? And what if MotorSafety is enabled on the turret as well. (And as I said above, I don’t consider turning off MotorSafety a solution).\n\nFor now, tolerating the errors seems to be the best approach. When the MotorSafety reports the error it also turns off the motors which is exactly what is required. It’s just that it shouldn’t be a reported error in this case.",
