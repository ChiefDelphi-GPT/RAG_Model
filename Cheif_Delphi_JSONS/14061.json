We liked the long space for our ball path, but the stability of a 36x23 was rough. We had a lot of creative code to minimize tipping. We also found if you t-boned us on the long side, we could not rotate off the defense, which was a major flaw. However, this same flaw was also a hidden strength. We used this to our advantage when playing defense and it worked fantastic. We could shut down even fast swerve teams like 6800 or tank teams like 176 quite effectively, and they could not pivot off of us due to our length. This led to that combo picking us for defense on Roebling, which was an incredible alliance that would have been hard to beat had it not been for our mechanical issues on Saturday combined with various bugs that appeared with 6800s serve. If we remade a robot for this season it would be a square swerve, but rectangular is both possible and effective in situations",

As @Strategic noted, you gain stability on one axis by making it square, but you lose a little stability on the other axis. Depending on the CG of the robot, stability can be a factor (in general if your CG is low enough, the wheels will slip before you will tip).\n\nThis is the first year that I know of that we have done a square chassis for our swerve (we may have had a square chassis in 2015, I can’t recall). In previous years, there was some other constraint on the robot that drove us to a non-square geometry. In 2020, for example, we wanted to be able to get all 5 PCs in a straight line in our conveyor, so that drove us to a longer chassis in that direction. It also helped to move the shooter further away so from the intake so that we could make shots in the high port while in the protected zone. It also made the robot narrower which made the trench runs a little easier (more room on either side of the robot to get under the WoF. We were actually worried about how long and narrow the robot was in 2020, but it turned out to be just fine from a stability standpoint.\n\nI could give similar examples of design constraints on other aspects of the game and robot design that drove us to non-square frames in other years. These other consideration are what dictate the frame configuration, not the swerve drive itself.",

Some of the earliest code examples you can find online used this trick, actually.\n\nRectangular layouts have a similar but less significant optimization because X and Y rotation magnitudes won’t be identical for a single module, and will alternate X and Y for adjacent modules.\n\nBut I would imagine most teams are using the built-in kinematics software now and wouldn’t realize the gains anyway.",

The module states are linearly independent, so you have to compute four copies of the math regardless.\n\nEDIT: If you disallow kinks in the swerve drive trajectory (probably OK in practice since it’s holonomic), you could speed up trajopt by exploiting differential flatness of x, y, and heading. Then your decision variables can be about 10 spline coefficients instead of x, y, heading, and velocity decision variables for each timestep (adds up to potentially thousands of decision variables).",
