Any blade recommendations as well would be great.\n\nMy initial search brought me to this machine but I’m going to have to provide a set of multiple quotes on this so I can’t probably get exactly what I want, but I’m not sure yet.\n\nStandard Duty horizontal bandsaw offering accurate cutting, rugged gear box, hydraulic control, chip brush blade cleaner, and wet or dry.",

And we usually use a bandsaw or mill to face it down after the saw cut.

I’m personally a big fan of the Hydmech saw that we have here at CWRU, but looking at even used prices they don’t seem to be particularly affordable as far as FRC tools go.\n\nEdit: totally forgot to mention this, but as far as blade stock goes I highly recommend a blade welder and buying bulk blade material if you can. It not only allows you to save money on blades but you can also do neat things with the welder like cut the blade, put it through a hole, and weld it back together for internal features.",

Turning a dial on the gearbox to cut steel was much easier than changing a belt position. That said, there are better saws out there. The stop on this saw is not great. We replaced the hydraulic downfeed cylinder once. At one time the hinge was binding from being packed with chips. We broke one bolt on the vise. Oh, and it will drip/throw coolant on the floor because the catch pan is not big enough. We had to extend it, which gets in the way of the clamp handle. So, it has it’s faults, but it’s still an okay saw. I’d be looking for one with a larger coolant catch pan though.",
