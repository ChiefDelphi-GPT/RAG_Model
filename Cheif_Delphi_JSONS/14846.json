Everything seems to run fine in the simulator, and it even says deploy successful, but we end up with no robot code. NetConsole says “Fatal Python error: turn goal Segmentation fault”. Here’s the full output:\n\nXXXXXXI’m also unsure what “turn goal” and “distance goal” are. My firth thought was that we were printing it somewhere, but I can’t find it in the code at all, and we’re unable to enable the robot, so I don’t think we’d be able to print anything. Has anyone seen this before?XXXXXXX\n\nEdit: I found those print statments berried in MoveCommand\n\nWe tried initalizing MyRobot as both wpilib.TimedRobot and commands2.TimedCommandRobot. We’re using command based for auto and time based for teleop.\n\nHere’s our current versions of everything: Screen Shot 2022-03-14 at 8.14.58 AM 1124×756 35.8 KB\n\nScreen Shot 2022-03-14 at 8.14.58 AM 1124×756 35.8 KB\n\nScreen Shot 2022-03-14 at 8.14.58 AM 1124×756 35.8 KB",

Your code doesn’t have anything that looks obviously wrong to me.\n\nOne thing that sticks out as weird to me – do you actually have two NavX on your robot? You create one in the drivesubsystem and one in robot.py, using two different ports. If you don’t actually have two NavX connected, definitely start by fixing that (it looks like you aren’t using the one in robot.py), as it’s possible the vendor code isn’t written to expect two devices, especially if one isn’t there.\n\nI don’t have time to try it on my RoboRIO this morning, but I can give it a shot tonight. It seems likely that it’s either a RobotPy wrapping error or an issue in a vendor library. Here’s my recommendations for diagnosing it:\n\nSee above about NavX\n\nFirst, definitely upgrade everything and try again. While I’m not aware of any issues that have been fixed recently, this is always my first recommendation. FIRST is requiring image 2022v4.0 for competition, and it’s possible there are issues with wpilib < 2022.4.1 regarding that change\n\nFIRST is requiring image 2022v4.0 for competition, and it’s possible there are issues with wpilib < 2022.4.1 regarding that change\n\nRe-image your RoboRIO, reinstall robotpy, try again\n\nComment out all of those print statements and see if you can get a more consistent crash message\n\nFinally, it’s really good that this happens consistently. Recommend that you start commenting out commands and devices until the bug goes away, and comes back when you uncomment a specific thing. If you can identify the thing that is breaking, it’s likely that I’ll be able to identify why it’s breaking.",
