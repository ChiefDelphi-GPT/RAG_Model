                    "cooked": "Hi, We are trying to convert our C++ Swerve drive code for SDS Mk4i modules with Falcons on the drive and steer from Phoenix 5 to Phoenix 6.\n\nWe only use the CANCoder on the Swerve Module to initialize the internal encoder count on the steering Falcon and then use position control on the falcon to set steering angles.\n\nThe Steering Control loop used to be done all in falcon native sensor units so it was 2048 * 150 /7 = ~43886 Counts per 360 degrees of swerve azimuth.  We used to keep a count of the number of time the steering module crossed the 180/-180 mark and increment or decrement a wind up counter so that the setpoint never did a sudden jump of ~43,000 units when the angle changed from say 179 to -179.\n\nHaving seen all the new features of Phoenix 6, we would like to implement the continuous mechanism wrap feature so all this 180 boundary crossing stuff is handled internally inside the Falcon.  But we finding the code change from phoenix 5 syntax to phoenix 6 syntax a bit of a challenge.  Everything now uses the units class in turns_t and you have to setup motor to mechanism ratios and you have to get status frames and then get values out of the status frames and then get doubles out this, to print stuff to the dashboard, etc.  This was starting to melt my mind when I thought surely we are not the first team to convert their C++ SDS Swerve code from Phoenix 5 to Phoenix 6 syntax.\n\nDoes anybody have some C++ code specifically for SDS Mk4i modules running Falcons (NB:Our steering motors are re-inverted back to facing upwards). Yeh, I know, why don’t we just use mk4’s instead of mk4i’s if you want the motors facing upwards. Because we have mk4i’s not mk4’s.\n\nAnyway, is anyone is willing to share their C++ Falcon based Swerve Module Class Code that is using the Phoenix 6 features like continuous wrap and motor to mechanism ratios, that would be excellent.\n\nNB: I’m fundamentally opposed to paying again for something that we have already purchased, so we didn’t want to use the annual pay for use features of the Pro licence, so no fancy CANCoder Fusion backlash compensation stuff please, we just want to use the internal PID inside the Falcon to handle the steering.\n\nCheers Warren",

                    "cooked": "I thought I might get someone to chime in here, but either no-one is using the continuous wrap c++ phoenix6 feature on SDS modules or no one is willing to share their knowledge.\n\nSo I’ll document what I have figured out in case some one else finds this post and has the same questions as me. Disclaimer: this could be the completely wrong to be doing this. Use this information at your own risk\n\n.h file has an instance of a cancoder and an instance of a Falcon motor\n\nThe following code would be in the .cpp file  (Probably in the constructor of the Swerve Module) Inline comments describe what is going on.\n\nThe last thing I’ve got to work out is how to set the initial position of the falcon at power on.  Previously, we would read the CANcoder angle, divide this by 360, multiple the answer by the number of encoder counts required to rotate the swerve module through one revolution, then call m_motor.SetSelectedSensorPosition(PowerOnPostionCount);\n\nI have no idea how this is done now.  Is it done in decimals of a rotation? Is it done relative to the mechanism rotations or relative to motor rotations?\n\nThe only thing I’ve found in Phoenix tuner X that is close is “Rotor Offset” in the feedback section but from what I can work out I can only set this with values from -1 to 1 and I need to be able to set it to values up to 12.8 for everything to work.  It seems that its almost there with the SensorToMechanismRatio and Continuous wrap stuff, but not quiet there yet.\n\n@bhall-ctre Hopefully someone from CTRE might chime in here and help me out.\n\nCheers",
