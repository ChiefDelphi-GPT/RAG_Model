                    "cooked": "Our team has used VexPro VersaFrame pre-drilled tubing for many years now and have developed an ecosystem around it, where we can use 8-32 screws where we need to through-bolt something, or tap the existing holes to 10-32, use rivets, or just drill them out if we need another fastener. Granted, this only works on thick-wall stock, and the tapped 10-32 holes aren’t the strongest (due to the stock only being 0.1\" thick), but it’s worked for us.\n\nI’ve looked at a lot of the pre-drilled stock options that other vendors have come out with more recently, but have avoided them primarily because they all seem to be drilled for 0.201\" holes (or larger), which would make them too big for 8-32s to fit well, and also impossible to tap for 10-32 (requiring rivnuts or through-bolting with locknuts). Recently, it seems even the latest versions of the VexPro stock has gone this way too, leaving us in a difficult position as we plan to restock supplies for the upcoming season.\n\nIs anyone aware of a vendor that still sells pre-drilled aluminum tubing stock with smaller holes (~0.163\")? I know there’s been a bunch of new FRC suppliers in recent years, so I’m kind of hoping I just missed one of them or something. While we do have a CNC mill/router, I’m not confident we could reach the level of accuracy/consistency that we’d be happy with, plus not to mention the incredible amount of time and effort it would take for the amount of stock we like to buy.",

I found them on these two pages:\n\nElevators can be more effective at lifting objects than arms because they don’t move the object further away from the robot while lifting. The tradeoff in performance comes with complexity, and often this has kept many teams from making elevator...\n\nPrice: USD 49.99\n\nArms are the go-to, simple mechanism for moving objects in FRC, yet despite being one of the simplest mechanisms out there, it’s sometimes hard to find everything you need to build an arm all in one place. Making an arm is easy, and we’ll show you...\n\nPrice: USD 7.99\n\nI’m not sure if they plan to continue selling these in the future since most teams and vendors are standardizing on #10-32 (+ 3/16 rivets) and getting rid of #8-32 screws.",

As VexPro seems to be scaling back their offerings I think it will generally be harder and harder to find FRC structure components that prioritize compatibility with #8 .

When you look at the drawings for those parts, they show the holes as 0.201\".\n\nThey DO still appear to still sell C and L channel and plastic tube stock using the smaller hole pattern, and the drawing page on their website appears to default load an outdated drawing of the thin-wall 1\"x1\" tube stock, but that seems to be just because they didn’t update that on the website.\n\nUnless I’m just blind and there’s somewhere I’m not looking (entirely possible).",

Both it and 1/4-inch bolts are available in a standard fine pitch of 28 threads per inch, which still gives over three full turns of engagement in 1/8\" material.\n\nThe Unified Thread Standard (UTS) defines a standard thread form and series—along with allowances, tolerances, and designations—for screw threads commonly used in the United States and Canada. It is the main standard for bolts, nuts, and a wide variety of other threaded fasteners used in these countries. It has the same 60° profile as the ISO metric screw thread, but the characteristic dimensions of each UTS thread (outer diameter and pitch) were chosen as an inch fraction rather than a millime...\n\nedit: actually, the 0.201 hole standard is almost perfect for 12-24 or 12-28 thread-forming taps. (Sources differ on exactly the right drill sizes; here are two .) It’s close enough that you can probably just go right in to thin aluminum without any drilling. Thread-forming taps don’t make chips, so you don’t have to worry about keeping the part and its surroundings clean, and you also don’t have to worry about backing the tap up periodically to break and clear chips.",
