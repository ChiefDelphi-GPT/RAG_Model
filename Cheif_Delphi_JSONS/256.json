                    "cooked": "seen some struggle for teams to auto align to the reef so I wanted to create a tutorial of how to do it.\n\nbefore I begin a I will point out a few things: I will show the simplest way to auto align to the reef this is not the most optimized way to do it but it works really good when tuned well defiantly faster than 99% of drivers.\n\nalso I will talk about the vision processor side a bit but will focus more on the  robot code side.\n\nok first of all to start you will need a way to 3d track april tags. the 2 easiest way to this right now are limelight and PhotonVision. both options are good limelight is easier to set up and use so i would recommend it to new teams and teams who want to mess with it less, but limelight’s are more expansive than running photon so you can decide for your own if its worth it. this tutorial will use limelight but can be adapted to PhotonVision pretty easily.\n\nfor this kind of auto aligning you need to put your camera on the robot in a place it can see the tag both from a far but also when you are very close to it, if needed you can try doing things like putting the camera  high looking down or low looking up.\n\n*it is not recommended putting the camera exactly at the height of the tag so go  a bit bellow or above.\n\n‎ ‎ ok now lets begin for real\n\nenable 3d tracking in the limelight web interface you need to set your pipeline to april tags than go the “advanced” tab and set the “Full 3D Targeting” option to “Yes” image 918×510 81.1 KB\n\nimage 918×510 81.1 KB\n\nimage 918×510 81.1 KB\n\nin here you also need to set your Visualizer setup\n\nI will use “Robot pose in Target Space” this means the data in the visualizer bellow will be from the pov of the april tag as of it is sable at a fixed point and the robot it moving relative to it.\n\nin the standard tab set the sort mode to closest image 1920×1115 64.1 KB\n\nimage 1920×1115 64.1 KB\n\nimage 1920×1115 64.1 KB\n\n!!NOTICE you also need to tune your camera Exposure and gain I will not explain here how but you can check this doc\n\n‎\n\nyou are now done setting up your camera lets move to the robot code.\n\nstart by downloading limelight helper class from this link in limelight’s github and adding it to your code\n\nafter you did that create a new command for the auto aligning and now we will see how the aligning itself is done. check the full command is in here full command\n\n!!make sure your drive function is robot relative!!!\n\nwhat do you need to change to make this command work for you robot\n\nshort answer: all the constants\n\nlong answer:\n\nimage 1118×195 11.7 KB\n\nimage 1118×195 11.7 KB\n\nimage 1118×195 11.7 KB\n\nthe tolerance: this is how much error we are allowing. the smaller the value the more accurate we want to be but the harder it is to tune. I recommend putting this value a bit smaller than how much the robot needs to be aligned. don’t make this value too large as than the aligning will stop to early and the robot won’t be aligned and don’t make it too small as than it will be really hard to tune, and also d you really need to be accurate to the mm or maybe 5 or 10 mm would be close enough\n\nthe setpoints: put your robot on the field where you want it to be at the end of the aligning (where it is when it scores)\n\nthen open the limelight web interface and go to the advanced tab and get the robot position from there\n\nmake sure you set the view to “Robot pose in Target Space”\n\nset each setpoint to its relative value in the web interface\n\nx stepoint = TX y setpoint = TZ* rot setpoint = RY\n\n*if your camera isn’t centered with your scoring system you would need to have 2 different values for the right and left reef pipes. if it is centered you can just use the same value but but negative (-Constants.Y_SETPOINT_REEF_ALIGNMENT)\n\n‎ image 798×149 9.55 KB DONT_SEE_TAG_WAIT_TIME - how long that we don’t see the tag before we stop the command\n\nimage 798×149 9.55 KB\n\nimage 798×149 9.55 KB\n\nPOSE_VALIDATION_TIME - how long we need to be aligned before we finish the command. too small of a value might make the robot miss if the pid isn’t perfect and you ahve overshoot, too long just waste time.\n\nrecommend putting this at a high value when tuning to make sure the pid is good and there isnt any overshoot and lower it later.\n\n‎\n\nnow the most important thing the pid values this need to be changed by testing and tuning (there a lot of places and threads to learn how to tune) run the command see how it goes and change the values accordingly image 987×96 14.2 KB ‎\n\nimage 987×96 14.2 KB\n\nimage 987×96 14.2 KB\n\n‎\n\nwhat are all of this??\n\nxController - a pid controller that will do the aligning in the x direction yController - a pid controller that will do the aligning in the y direction rotController - a pid controller that will do the aligning of the robots rotation\n\nisRightScore - each side of the reef has two scoring pipes this boolean is used to choose if you want to go to the right pipe if it is true or the left pipe if its false\n\ndontSeeTagTimer - this timer counts the time since we last saw the tag we align to and if we haven’t seen for for some time it automatically stops the command\n\nstopTimer - if the pid is not perfect we might overshot and miss the target this timer is used so that the robot waits a bit when its aligned to make sure it stopped and is truly aligned\n\ntagID - the ID of the tag we align to. *its the first tag saw when we started aligning ‎\n\nbuilder setting the pid constants and saving the isRightScore image 1007×209 18.4 KB\n\nimage 1007×209 18.4 KB\n\nimage 1007×209 18.4 KB\n\ninitialize image 1133×496 29.6 KB\n\nimage 1133×496 29.6 KB\n\nimage 1133×496 29.6 KB\n\ncreating the timers and starting them\n\nsetting the setpoints and tolerance for the pid controllers setpoint - the target we want to align to tolerance - what is our acceptable error\n\ngetting the id of the tag we align to\n\n‎ execute\n\nimage 1115×563 33.5 KB\n\nimage 1115×563 33.5 KB\n\nimage 1115×563 33.5 KB\n\nthe if is checking if we see a target and if the target has the id we are aligning to\n\nwe reset the dontSeeTagTimer because we saw a tag\n\nwe get the pose of the robot relative to the tag as an array and put in the variable positions\n\nwe use the pid to calculate the speed we want the robot to drive at giving it the distance from the tag and it giving us what speeds to drive the robot\n\ndrive - setting the speeds for the robot to drive at !!!NOTICE the drive has to be robot relative and not field relative\n\n“yController.getError() < Constants.Y_TOLERANCE_REEF_ALIGNMENT ? xSpeed : 0” - this line in the drive code is used to make sure we are aligned in the y direction before we start alignin in the x direction if you want both alignment to happen at the same time replace this with xSpeed\n\nthis checks if we are aligned and if not it reset the stop timer\n\nisFinished image 811×145 9.54 KB\n\nimage 811×145 9.54 KB\n\nimage 811×145 9.54 KB\n\ncheck if we either didn’t see a tag in some time or we are aligned and if so stops the command",

I’m not sure if we’ve missed up in the code somewhere or that our limelight is not adjusted properly, but when we run the command it simply won’t move. The command does run because we have implemented a long wait just to make sure it was going through. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.\n\n*Our limelight targeting stream also shows the crosshair flickering in and out while targeting so our values keep populating then setting back to zero really quickly. I’m not sure if that is intended or not. Can provide a video if need be.\n\nHere is our current code: https://github.com/pauleyd410/2025-Reefscape-Bot-main",

You should always put your exposure to the minimum or at least keep it to the default 200. Right now as your exposure is 3300 so your limelight will take each frame in 3300 .01ms intervals so each picture will take 33ms to be taken.\n\nAlso you should take a look at what the original poster showed in his “setting up the limelight” explanation\n\nLimelightOS stores up to 10 unique vision pipelines.",

I believe you will find the flickering suddenly changes or disappears.\n\nIt appears that this flickering is an aliasing of the overhead light refresh rate in our location.  We did a thought experiment - the 40 hz is about 2/3 of the 60hz AC provided to light fixtures.  Sure enough, our flicker acted about the way we’d expect if there was aliasing going on.\n\nThen, we changed to a much higher resolution to verify it.\n\nYou can often see this phenomenon in car lights through dash cams - the LED’s flicker at a rate fast enough that they look continuous to the eye, but when they sync up with the dash cam you can get some interesting effects.\n\nGoogle AI explanation: LED light flicker in dashcam footage is often due to a mismatch between the frequency of the LED lights and the dashcam’s camera’s frame rate and shutter speed . This results in a stroboscopic effect where the LEDs appear to blink or flicker.\n\nHere’s a more detailed explanation:\n\nPulse Width Modulation ( PWM ):\n\nLED lights often use PWM to control their brightness by rapidly switching the LED on and off.\n\nFrequency Mismatch:\n\nIf the frequency at which the LEDs are switching on and off (the PWM frequency) doesn’t align with the dashcam’s frame rate and shutter speed, the stroboscopic effect can make the lights appear to flicker.\n\nExample:\n\nIf the LED light is switching on and off at 60 Hz, but the camera is recording at 30 FPS, the dashcam might capture the LED as flickering. =========End Google AI==========\n\nNow - I can’t say for certain how this will effect your vision.  So far, it isn’t significant enough to throw ours off.",
