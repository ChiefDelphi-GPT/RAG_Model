I have found a lot of information regarding measuring radio communication quality, but I have had less luck finding information to help assess the quality of the CAN bus.\n\nThe students would like to assess wire routing options.  We have discussed things like crosstalk and good wiring options, but we’ve also discussed that the CAN bus uses differential signaling and twisted pairs, which should significantly shield noise from the motor power wires.\n\nAs such, I have a few questions:\n\nWhere does CAN Utilization % come from?  Is that something the students must add to their robot SW on the RoboRIO, or is that something that just comes automagically to the Driver Station logs?\n\nWhere does CAN Utilization % come from?

If so, is there a readable measurement of number of retries?  Or is it observable as a higher-than-expected utilization?\n\nAll that said, I would love to enable the students to prove to themselves through measuring CAN bus quality under different wiring scenarios.  This would enable them to demonstrate to themselves the importance of termination resistors, what happens when the daisy chain breaks (which devices are affected), routing CAN bus wires adjacent to motor power wires (idle vs under load), etc.\n\nAny advice on how to guide them, or links to previous such experiments/results, would be greatly appreciated!\n\n…dane",
