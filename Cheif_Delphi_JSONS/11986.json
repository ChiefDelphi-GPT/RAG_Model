                    "cooked": "Hi everyone, This is my first year using OpenCV and so far I have found it wildly intuitive to perform Vision Processing on an rPi (we are using Java, by the way). I have been using it for detecting the angle and position of the game pieces (cone, cube) and for the cube it is working great. For the cone it is working efficiently, and it is returning an angle… but not the one that we want. minAreaRect by default has a range between [0, 90), but we would like something between 0 and 180, or -90 to 90. I believe that it would have something to do with the relative lengths of the width and height of the minAreaRect Rectangle itself (or possibly the always-upright bounding box) but thus far nothing that I have tried has worked. I feel like I’m on the verge of figuring it out but I think getting an opinion from someone who has been using OpenCV longer would be better. I would appreciate any help, and thank you!\n\nNote that the reason it is “working” for the cube is because for that we really only need a range between [0, 90) due to its rotational symmetry.",

I have seen this post before, and so far it doesn’t seem to be working when I apply the exact same logic… I was thinking of another idea, however: creating a convexHull object for the cone target, and getting the side lengths of each side of the convexHull . With that, I’d find the shortest side, and that side would have to be the tip of the cone. Depending on where that segment is relative to the center (the midpoint of that side compared to the center of the cone), that would tell me if it’s in the first, second, third, or fourth quadrant, allowing me to easily calculate the angle between 0 and 180 or -90 and 90, as opposed to 0 to 90… Is it possible to create a convexHull object as opposed to just drawing one, allowing me to extract information from it? what do you think? Thanks once again for the guidance!",

I’m sure that this would have to do with differentiating the tip of the cone compared to the rest of the cone, so do you have any more efficient ideas as to how I could access that w/o using the convexHull ?\n\nIn regards to your other recommendation, @SLAB-Mr.Thomas , I noticed that minEnclosingTriangle is a void method in that it doesn’t return on object  - it simply draws on the original image. I was scrubbing through the documentation, and, for the life of me, I could not find anything explaining how to get a triangle object. Perhaps I should find the midpoint of one of the sides? But that wouldn’t work since the tip of the cone will switch between segments of the rectangle as it rotates around. Thank you all once again!\n\nSincerely, Rohan",
