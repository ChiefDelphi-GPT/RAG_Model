                    "cooked": "Despite building a new offseason robot , we decided to run Systemcore on our in-season robot at Sunset Showdown last weekend. This robot has been battle-tested, well understood by our team, and has had no reliability issues all season, giving us a more fair apples-to-apples comparison with the RoboRIO.\n\nOur goal was to perform a one-to-one transplant of the RIO with the Systemcore with minimal changes. This meant transferring the power, ethernet, USB CANivore, PDH CAN , RSL , and one digital input over to the new controller.\n\nimage 1920×1440 273 KB\n\nimage 1920×1440 273 KB\n\nimage 1920×1440 273 KB\n\nAlthough the RSL and DIO ports on the Systemcore have locking Molex SL connectors, we found that our existing 0.1” pitch DuPont (standard servo) connectors we already had on the robot fit right in. Additionally, the Molex SL receptacles provide a lot more support to the connector housing compared to just the RIO’s pins, making the connection a lot more secure and reduces the risk of bending pins.\n\nThe Weidmuller connection for power is a lot easier to use than the old RIO screw terminal and reduces the risk of an inadequately tightened screw terminal coming out mid-match. However, this looks subject to change , so we will have to see what the final decision ends up being. Personally, having fewer crimps on the robot and the flexibility to make on-field fixes are both beneficial for maintaining high reliability.\n\nWe have traditionally used beam breaks that require a pull-up resistor since the RoboRIO’s digital IO had one. The Systemcore DIO contains a pull-down so in order to convert a to a pull-up, the built-in pull-down needs to be overwhelmed with a lower value pull-up (e.g. 10x lower value). In the case of our beam break, we were able to use this strong pull-up, but it ended up needing to be around 400 ohms due to the 4.7 kohm pull up in Systemcore. The potential issue with a strong pull-up like this one is that it requires the beam break to sink a somewhat significant amount of current that not all components may be able to handle (check the datasheet for your specific sensor). Doing this workaround with multiple beam breaks may also cause a non-insignificant amount of current to be drawn from all digital IOs across Systemcore (luckly we only had one).\n\nSwitching to pull-down-compatible beam brakes is not preferable since that would require the voltage to be sourced by the beam break. In the case of many beam breaks, they may not run off of 3.3 V (ours in particular run off 12 V), which would require a voltage regulator or some sort of level shifter to support the input voltage on Systemcore.\n\nFortunately, this problem is already recognized by Limelight and hopefully a future hardware revision will address these concerns.\n\nWe tried not adding a USB stick for logs as we typically do, since we wanted to reduce points of failure and figured the 16GB eMMC should have a longer lifespan than the RIO2 SD card. Unfortunately, we didn’t realize that the main partition is only 4GB and ran out of space for logs halfway through playoffs and didn’t catch this until we got home. However, even when out of storage, the system ran just fine. We plan on putting the USB stick back in the future.\n\nWe ran at Sunset Showdown with WPILib 2027 alpha 2 and Systemcore alpha 5 (release 166). We made no significant software changes since Champs. The only major code change was configuring the Systemcore to use the Z garbage collector (inspired by 6328 ).\n\nOn the RoboRIO 2, our median loop time when enabled is ~14 ms. While 95% of loops are under 20 ms, there are many loop overruns primarily due to garbage collection spikes. Note that these high loop times in general are not ideal and caused largely by excessive amounts of input logging to aid in log replay (e.g. we logged both the used and unused signals from all I/O devices as well as the entire PhotonPipelineResult from multiple cameras). This was a conscious choice on our part and we had plans to disable certain parts of the logging if the loop times ever truly got out of hand.\n\nimage 1600×1003 135 KB\n\nimage 1600×1003 135 KB\n\nimage 1600×1003 135 KB\n\nOn the Systemcore with no software changes, we saw a ~10x reduction in the median loop time down to ~1.5 ms. Even the maximum never exceeded 5 ms when enabled once the JVM was warmed up. Aside from the initial boot, we saw no loop overruns during the match when running on the default 20 ms period.\n\nimage 1408×1072 68.7 KB\n\nimage 1408×1072 68.7 KB\n\nimage 1408×1072 68.7 KB\n\nEven though garbage collection still takes a significant amount of time (>50 ms), the work is done concurrently and only briefly blocks the main thread. We haven’t tried tuning other garbage collection parameters, but it’s great to see these large performance gains that will make it significantly easier for teams to hit their timing requirements without a lot of effort on optimization.\n\nimage 1600×1095 108 KB\n\nimage 1600×1095 108 KB\n\nimage 1600×1095 108 KB\n\nRemoving additional components and thus potential points of failure is always a goal. We were excited by the Systemcore’s inclusion of an internal IMU. In the spirit of minimal changes for testing, we continued to use our external Pigeon2 but logged both devices so we could compare them afterwards. Note that Limelight has indicated that there will be upcoming improvements to the IMU, but we wanted to get a baseline for performance.\n\nSince neither the Systemcore nor the Pigeon2 can provide ground truth data, the best we can do is compare them relatively. Here is a plot comparing the difference in final yaw rotation at the end of 17 matches between the Pigeon2 and Systemcore plotted against the total amount of robot rotation in the given match. The Pigeon2 and Systemcore often drift less than 2 deg from each other over the course of a match, but tend to drift more when the rotates more. Trimming the Systemcore gyro may help with this, but there doesn’t seem to be an option to do that right now.\n\nimage 587×354 15.1 KB\n\nimage 587×354 15.1 KB\n\nimage 587×354 15.1 KB\n\nLooking at a match with a particularly high final differential, it’s interesting to note that the difference in yaw stays pretty constant, but then grows at around 225s and then levels off again. This does not seem to be correlated with extreme robot motion (e.g. from turning a lot or impacts from defense), nor robot temperature. It’s unclear at the moment what is causing this behavior.\n\nimage 864×527 16.4 KB\n\nimage 864×527 16.4 KB\n\nimage 864×527 16.4 KB\n\nReefscape is a relatively tame game but we did have several hard hits throughout playoffs while busting through defense at the coral station. Everything held up fine throughout the weekend with zero reliability issues. It’s too early to draw any conclusions about hardware durability, but it looks promising so far.\n\nSystemcore at our first offseason was a great success. Everything “just worked” with the field and we did not experience any problems on the field or during practice in the days leading up to the competition. Now that we’ve established a solid baseline, we are eager to try to take more advantage of the new hardware for future experiments. If you have any things you’d like us to look into, please let us know! We plan on running this a lot more between now through Chezy Champs.",

Our single-tag trig-based localization for scoring is fully reliant on having an accurate gyro reading throughout the match and we have found that the Pigeon 2 has given us a good enough reading throughout all our matches without the need for re-zeroing either manually or based on vision.\n\nDuring practice, setting up the robot incorrectly by ~3 degrees begins to affect our scoring accuracy, so the Pigeon 2 is definitely drifting less than that over the course of a match.",
