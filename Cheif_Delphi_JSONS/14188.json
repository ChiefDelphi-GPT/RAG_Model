I figure putting down this spoken wisdom in writing might help a lot of teams improve, and I suggest this thread as a place to collect it. So, what item of knowledge can you share? Looking for information in any field – mechanical, electrical, programming, control…\n\nI’m splitting this to two threads, to make it easier for us to keep consistency in the level of knowledge we share. This thread is for “common” knowledge, i.e. information that most teams probably already have, and may help newer teams and\\or otherwise less experienced (I’m sure a lot of teams lost a lot of “common” knowledge during Covid). For example, did you know that you could 3D print timing pulleys reliably? I didn’t. Based on what I’ve seen in competition, most of you probably did.\n\nPlease elaborate as much or as little as you can/want, from a full white paper to a single line, everything helps.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your spoken wisdom! My contribution is in the first reply.",

                    "cooked": "If possible, avoid attaching a shaft to the same body in more than two points (i.e. bearings or hubs). A line passes through two points, and since every part/assembly has some tolerances, it is virtually impossible for three bearings/hubs to line up perfectly when mounted on the same body. If you try passing a shaft through three bearings, at best, assembly will be a struggle; at worst, the shaft will be stressed, and over time these stresses might cause it to fail.\n\n(To be clear, when I say “three bearings”, I mean all three are mounted to the same body. A shaft will usually have at least four points of attachment, but to different bodies; for example, if a shaft connects an arm to the body of the robot, we might have two bearings mounted in the body of the robot and two hubs on the arm itself. That’s still only two points of attachment to each body.)",

So if you have a high-torque connection like the final joint in an arm, don’t use a shaft, use a big sprocket that’s bolted near the edges of it to the arm.\n\nA sprocket+chain connection is a good choice for the final stage of something that might see a lot of external shock force applied (e.g. an arm that extends outside the robot).  Chain+sprocket has a lot more contact area than a gear tooth, so is going to be more tolerant to shock loads–and as stated above, also has less force applied in general if you follow the previous paragraph.",

For very high load things with lots of potential bending forces, such as the main shaft of a long arm, you will want something designed for that load. You can use larger diameter, thin wall hollow tubing to achieve this.\n\nBefore there were solid COTS products to fill this niche (check out REV’s offerings, or the VersaRoller, etc), a decent enough solution would be to use 1.125\" OD bushings and 1\" OD or 7/8\" OD hollow tube. This preserves compatibility with various COTS things that hold bearings while being much stronger in bending than hex shaft. With a thick enough wall (1/8\")  you can even be just as strong in shear, but you generally don’t need to be and so you can save weight over hex shaft by going to 1/16\" or so.\n\nThis is one of those things I’ll see veteran teams all had their own preferred solution for, but lots of younger teams will just use hex shafts everywhere, and end up with twisted and broken arms. Just something to keep in mind!",

You need to spend the time to figure out why it worked, why it is a good choice for your robot and how it was constructed. You need to potentially adapt it to a different size game piece and to the rest of your robot. You may end up studying another team’s CAD model in the process and see details of how a design was built that will teach you new techniques for doing things that add to you knowledge. You may also study their code and learn about control system techniques and automation. Bottom line is that there is a lot of valuable growth and learning to be gained through the process of coping a successful design from the past.",
