I’m sure there is a way to change the speed variable (either be making it negative or changing the value - or both) that is passed into the command, but I can’t figure out how to do it. The only reference I can see to doing this is in this comment, but there are no details provided:\n\nToggleable \"robot mode\" using a button Java\n\nCurrently the arcade drive command call we are using is this (thank you 0 to Autonomous for the fundamentals!):\n\ndriveSubsystem.setDefaultCommand(new ArcadeDriveCmd(driveSubsystem, () → -joyDrive.getRawAxis(Constants.OIConstants.kArcadeDriveSpeedAxis), () → joyDrive.getRawAxis(Constants.OIConstants.kArcadeDriveTurnAxis)));",

And like you said, it’s not really a good solution anyway.\n\nI’m not familiar with instant commands, I’ll have to take a look. Except for what we cobbled together last year I’m not really familiar with Java (and definitely not familiar with the command based structure), so I’m very much learning as we go.\n\nAs for the edit - there’s actually no reason to not just check the state inside the command. It actually would probably be the easiest way to solve the problem, not sure why I didn’t consider it.\n\nAnd I know nothing about suppliers other than simply copying the code from 0 to Autonomous, so that wasn’t a route I had thought to look at either.\n\nRegardless, I think I’m going to go with just checking the button state inside the command.
