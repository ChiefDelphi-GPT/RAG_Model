Control System\n\nParse FIRST FRC driver station log files. Contribute to ligerbots/dslogparser development by creating an account on GitHub.\n\nWith the latest driver station, it seems that the log version changed to 4.  The python script seems to work with the new log version if I ignore version checking.\n\nAnybody know where I can find change log or any information on version 4 logs/events?\n\nThanks, Casey",

By taking a small file, opening it in driverstation, and stepping through header, LV timestamp, LV string. It seems to match up.\n\nThe python script did not work for the dslog.  It read things in…but a few things were off:\n\nLooking in Driverstation, the voltage seemed to range between 12.5 to 12.7 volts from what I could see.  The Robot was never placed into autonomous mode. Driver station also showed 24 PDP’s and all of them were noted as zero.\n\nThe python script though created a csv where auto was true, and voltage was all over the place.\n\nI opened the log using od -ha, and looked for repeating patterns.\n\nIt seemed like after the 10 byte information of each line, there were 68 bytes before similar 10 bytes started repeating again.\n\nMy example dslog was 489470 bytes long.  With a 20 byte version/LV timestamp header, that left 48950 bytes that should be evenly divisible, and 48950/78=6275\n\nIf I change the python to assign 68 bytes to the PDP, it’s still not correct, as some of the PDP’s are showing values.\n\nHowever the values for the first 10 bytes match with what would be reasonable for when the driver station was logging.\n\nIf I can get closer to what the format should be, I will open a pull request for the python script.\n\nThanks, Casey",
