How many of your teams use a DS transmission and what is your experience? Too we want to ask, what range speed you think is enough to trough the field quickly and what range torque is enough to push a 154 lbs robot? Any Spread ratio is worth or significant when we are selecting a DS Transmission?\n\nActually we are searching the WCP Double Speed 3 CIM Flipped, but we have too many questions before buy it, and thank you so much for your answers.",

I wouldn’t say we’ll never use a shifting gearbox in the future, but it would have to be a very unique game for us to consider it. As for the gear ratio, that depends largely on the wheel diameter, how many motors, and what floor speed you want to travel. In general, our team wants to have a top speed between 12-16 feet per second.",

Then as we got the ability to use more motors and those motors got better it became harder to justify the need and complexity of shifting.\n\nOnce we got to 6 motor drive we had a discussion every year on shifting to decide whether or not to use it because the power with single speed was there unless we wanted to go really fast for a cross field run.  That discussion pretty much ended when we got to brushless motors.  It has been, “Can anyone think of a reason we need to shift or have a power take off that justifies putting the mechanism in.”\n\nWith brushless you can have enough power to slip your wheels when in a pushing match and still hit 16 feet per second which is the full range an FRC robot needs.",

However even then, teams were highly successful with Kitbot drivetrains and other single speed options.\n\nNowadays with the increased motor power, and a general shift away from “pushing power” as the way to deal with defense, two speed drivetrains provide increased complexity for little competitive gain. (in my opinion - I’m sure some teams used shifting in 2022 and swear by it, but I think it’s unnecessary)",

                    "cooked": "Picture time!\n\nLet’s look at some “torque curves” of the motor/transmission system. X axis will be how fast the wheels are rotating (ie, how fast your bot is moving across the field), and Y axis will be how much force is getting put into the ground. All of these assume the motors are being driven at a full 12v with no current limiting.\n\nIn a pushing match, you’ll be near zero motor speed. Therefor, your ability to push is related to where the curve intercepts the Y axis.\n\nWhen traveling fast, your max speed is hit when the motors stop applying force to the ground (F=ma, if F = 0, a = 0, so velocity remains constant). Therefor, max speed is at the curve’s X-intercept.\n\nAs a general statement, “better” drivetrains will operate with both large X and large Y.\n\nimage 1552×947 132 KB\n\nimage 1552×947 132 KB\n\nimage 1552×947 132 KB\n\nFor a given set of motors, the gear ratio (“speed”) allows you to pick the tradeoff between top speed and max “torque to the ground” - IE pushing force.\n\nA high-reduction gear ratio results in lots of torque at the low end, but caps your top speed.\n\nimage 1579×893 8.1 KB\n\nimage 1579×893 8.1 KB\n\nimage 1579×893 8.1 KB\n\nA low-reduction gear ratio results in better top speed, at the cost of low-end torque:\n\nimage 1577×902 7.53 KB\n\nimage 1577×902 7.53 KB\n\nimage 1577×902 7.53 KB\n\nThe ideal two-speed gearbox lets you pick between both of these curves. Assuming you shift at just the right time, you can stay on the “top curve”. This means means you retain your low-end pushing ability, while still having a good top speed:\n\nimage 1563×925 23.1 KB\n\nimage 1563×925 23.1 KB\n\nimage 1563×925 23.1 KB\n\nLooks pretty ideal, right? Why wouldn’t everyone just do this?\n\nThere’s more considerations\n\nFirst of all, these things are heavy . Sometimes that’s desirable, but it takes away weight budget from other mechanisms.\n\nSecondly, there’s a traction limit. The wheel/ground interface can’t transfer infinite torque to the ground. At the point the wheels start to slip, the “torque to the ground” gets limited to a constant value, proportional to the kinetic coefficient of friction between rubber and carpet, and the robot’s weight.\n\nThird, there’s a speed limit related to your sprint distance. As you perform a cycle, there’s only so much speed you can accumulate before you have to start slowing down to stop. This point will move around based on your ability to accelerate or decelerate.\n\nFourth, you’re likely to have additional torque limits, which might be under your traction limit. If your robot has a high center of mass, you’ll have to artificially lower your maximum torque to the ground to prevent tipping. Far more common, the amperage required to push that hard is often more than a battery can sustain, so you apply a current limit (which is, effectively, just another torque limit).\n\nimage 1578×911 22.3 KB\n\nimage 1578×911 22.3 KB\n\nimage 1578×911 22.3 KB\n\nWith these limits in mind, we could pick an ideal set of gear ratios and motors to achieve performance that just barely touches up against our physics limits, but doesn’t try to push past them\n\nimage 1558×924 24.4 KB\n\nimage 1558×924 24.4 KB\n\nimage 1558×924 24.4 KB\n\nSo, given the limits, is single or double better? Hard to say - shifting does get you a little more performance, but is it worth the complexity, cost, and weight? Exactly how much better it is will depend a lot on exactly where those limits are, relative to the gear ratios in question.\n\nWhile I can’t say I’ve personally run the numbers to prove it out, the prevailing wisdom is that two brushless motors on grippy wheels will out-perform almost any other permutation on the market.  If you’ve got specifics and time to run a few experiments and numbers, you might be able to prove it out to yourself what’s better, given the constraints you have as a team. But, statistically, the answer will likely be to invest in brushless motors and a single speed gearbox, and save the weight and complexity for another mechanism.",

But if you have to put this thing right there and there’s a defender either in the way or planning on bashing you as soon as you get there, it’s going to matter a lot more. (The spoilers and ringer placement in Rack 'n Roll is the greatest example of this being critically important, iirc–it wasn’t enough to score a tube on a leg, you really, really wanted to score them on very specific legs.)",

The free speed was like 20ft/s and I remember asking around here if speed could be artificially limited via software, and it was.\n\nDriving around and getting used to the bot, I rarely let it out of the reduced speed. But if competition had happened, I’m sure there would be many times it would have been at full power.\n\nLooked at code, seems reduced speed caps at 70%",

Hard to say - shifting does get you a little more performance, but is it worth the complexity, cost, and weight? Exactly how much better it is will depend a lot on exactly where those limits are, relative to the gear ratios in question\n\nAll great advice. I’d recommend to the OP to simulate the situation and decide if it’s worth it to them. I personally like the ILITE Drivetrain Simulator .\n\nA big variable will be what the typical “sprint” is on the field. It’s more useful to look at shifting for a full field sprint, like 2017. I think you will see less benefit in games like 2018/2019 where there isn’t a lot of room for long sprints. You can test all that in the calculator though.",
