                    "cooked": "Hello everyone. Over the weeks we have been working with swerve and with the acquisition of Kraken motors we currently have kraken motors for the drive and falcon 500 motors for the steer. Our entire environment is CTRE so we use their library to use our swerve. We see that the generator gives us among all the files a TunerConstant.java where in several sections they tell us that they must be adjusted for our own robot. Beyond wanting to tune our constants, we want to obtain consistent cars, because we have been trying to manipulate the PID of PathPlanner but it seems that at some point any value we give it no longer has an effect. Doing a little research on CD I came across the SysId tool (we last used it in 2022 to characterize our differential robot). Now the tool is very different but a little reading is enough to have the basics.\n\nOur current situation is that we do not know what the “correct way” is to do all the characterization since we have the commands to execute the SysId routines but we do not know where it should be saved, since by default it should be in the roboRIO but if I connect a USB and it happens that they are saved there, also when analyzing the data, what should I analyze? I have 4 drive motors, do I have to analyze all 4 and take an average to obtain the value? or take the smallest or largest? The other issue is the units, I understand that now with Phoenix 6, all the sensor units have been set to rotations, whether rotations, rotations per second,… everything is based on rotations, so within SysId I leave it at rotations, but my doubt comes when I do the analysis, should I take the MotorVoltage, Position, Velocity of each motor, in this case it would be Drive, what should I move to the SysId analysis parameters? I understand that in the Feedback analysis the preset gain is set to default and in the period controller it should be at 1ms but like everything else, I look for them to correct us if we are wrong. Right now we were using the routines directly from the SysId library, but after reading, CTRE has some slightly different codes in its github of examples, in the afternoon we will be testing that code, and we decided to change the string that it saves with a different name for each test, which is also something that should affect the fact of performing both tests (translation and steer) and having saved them with the same name “state”. image 1920×1032 249 KB The following image is the characterization for the drive motors, I only take one motor (15) to obtain the analysis, I have entered those values into TunerConstants.java and it seems that the PathPlanner paths have been executed in a better way. image 1920×1032 243 KB\n\nimage 1920×1032 249 KB\n\nimage 1920×1032 249 KB\n\nimage 1920×1032 243 KB\n\nimage 1920×1032 243 KB\n\nFor the steer analysis I did not get good results, the tire oscillated a lot making exaggerated noises and in the end all the tires ended up blocking, since I did not know which sensors to take for the analysis, I assumed the engine sensors, but at some point I thought about take MotorVoltage for voltage and Position and Velocity take them from the module’s Cancoder but I’m not sure since I would also have to configure the scale of the values.\n\nWe hope you can take a little of your time\n\nThis is the code we used for what was explained above:\n\n/*\n\n* *********************** SysID *************************************\n\n*/\n\nprivate SwerveVoltageRequest driveVoltageRequest = new SwerveVoltageRequest(true);\n\nprivate SysIdRoutine m_driveSysIdRoutine =\n\nnew SysIdRoutine(\n\nnew SysIdRoutine.Config(null, null, null, ModifiedSignalLogger.logState()),\n\nnew SysIdRoutine.Mechanism(\n\n(Measure<Voltage> volts) -> setControl(driveVoltageRequest.withVoltage(volts.in(Volts))),\n\nnull,\n\nthis));\n\nprivate SwerveVoltageRequest steerVoltageRequest = new SwerveVoltageRequest(false);\n\nprivate SysIdRoutine m_steerSysIdRoutine =\n\nnew SysIdRoutine(\n\nnew SysIdRoutine.Config(null, null, null, ModifiedSignalLogger.logState()),\n\nnew SysIdRoutine.Mechanism(\n\n(Measure<Voltage> volts) -> setControl(steerVoltageRequest.withVoltage(volts.in(Volts))),\n\nThis is the code that we are going to test this afternoon, taken from the CTRE examples on github:\n\nprivate final SwerveRequest.SysIdSwerveTranslation TranslationCharacterization = new SwerveRequest.SysIdSwerveTranslation();\n\nprivate final SwerveRequest.SysIdSwerveRotation RotationCharacterization = new SwerveRequest.SysIdSwerveRotation();\n\nprivate final SwerveRequest.SysIdSwerveSteerGains SteerCharacterization = new SwerveRequest.SysIdSwerveSteerGains();\n\n/* Use one of these sysidroutines for your particular test */\n\nprivate final SysIdRoutine SysIdRoutineTranslation = new SysIdRoutine(\n\nnew SysIdRoutine.Config(\n\nnull,\n\nVolts.of(4),\n\nnull,\n\n(state) -> SignalLogger.writeString(\"stateTranslation\", state.toString())),\n\nnew SysIdRoutine.Mechanism(\n\n(volts) -> setControl(TranslationCharacterization.withVolts(volts)),\n\nnull,\n\nthis));\n\nprivate final SysIdRoutine SysIdRoutineRotation = new SysIdRoutine(\n\nnew SysIdRoutine.Config(\n\nnull,\n\nVolts.of(4),",

                    "cooked": "Hello.  My team is switching to an all- CTRE swerve drive this year, after using differential drive in the past.  I’m having trouble creating SysID code which utilizes the internal Talon FX sensors as encoders for the driving.  We do use CANcoders to get initial steering offsets, but we use the encoders in the TalonFX controllers embedded in the Kraken motors for drive control.  The sample SysID code provided in WPILIb uses external encoders, and I am not able to change the code successfully to use the CTRE m_motor.getPosition or m_motor.getVelocity classes to replace the m_motor.getDistance and m_motor.getRate classes used in the code.  If I try to scale m_motor.getPosition in order to return “distance” rather than “rotations”, I get a code error. Can you provide the code you used for SysID with CTRE components? When I go to the links in the discussion here, the code is “not found”.\n\nThanks!\n\n(SysID code from Github:\n\nOfficial Repository of WPILibJ and WPILibC.
