                    "cooked": "Hello, we have been facing a issue with one of our cascading elevator commands not finishing. For reference here is a link to the specific command in our code (within the TrapezoidProfile branch) that is malfunctioning. Feel free to compare with the other functioning commands in the Elevator Commands folder (there are 2) .\n\nOur issue is as follows: Our elevator follows every command until it has reached the desired tolerance within the command’s setpoint. The only command the elevator does not follow properly is the “set home” command. The elevator approaches the desired position of 0 but stops inches before its tolerance. If we run the “set home” command with the “on true” button (simply press a button and let go) the elevator will simply stop a couple of inches above the desired tolerance, not ending the command. Consequently, we are forced to run the “set home” command with the “while true” button (hold the button) so once we let go of the button, it kills the command, lowering the elevator from its “stuck” position down to home.\n\nHere are two different commands logged in advantage kit:\n\nElevatorToL4: photo\n\nSetHome: IMG_3740 1920×2560 552 KB\n\nIMG_3740 1920×2560 552 KB\n\nIMG_3740 1920×2560 552 KB\n\nWe believe these two commands use the equivalent logic but for some reason don’t run identically.\n\nWe have considered a limit switch for this, but of course we think it’s solvable without one. If you recommend a limit switch that’s fine, but please consider taking a look at our code for any visible errors and if no such thing we will end up with a limit switch, thank you!",

                    "cooked": "It appears you don’t have a default command, which is likely part of the issue with how the commands behave differently, along with  other small subtle differences.\n\nOne of those is MoveToL4 does not have have a “elevator.stop()” line. So, when the command ends at the end of the profile, the motor will continue to have whatever output it was left with, as generated by the PID . This might be forcing it downward or holding it up, depending on the remaining error and accuracy of your kv/kA constants. setHome does not have this; You actually stop it, and it’s doing as indicated: Stopping. A good defaultCommand would nominally capture intended outputs, and do something reasonable. This could be a PID to the goal state, or applying appropriate feed-forwards for kG to ensure the elevator stays in position. Right now, it’s just being left to run with whatever output the motor had when your last thing ran.\n\nMoving on from there though: Is your “set home” command intended to actually move the motor to end of travel to reset it? If so, the code is both conceptually incorrect and implemented incorrectly.\n\nIn the implementation, the encoder is never reset after a successful homing process. This is added to the code, but commented out. You should normally have this in the end() block, after it’s succeeded motion.\n\nNext, is that it won’t actually home: When the robot/controller boots up, zero is just wherever it happens to be at the time, rather than at the end of travel. A homing sequence needs to find this end of travel. However, you cannot use a position PID for this, since you don’t actually know the distance from your current, unknown position, to the true zero of the system. For this, you’d want to use a simpler output method, usually outputting a small duty cycle like motor.set(-0.1) . Your end condition is then “when it stops moving”, which is somewhat trickier to detect. A common approach is current detection, using motor.getOuptutCurrent() > number , where number is somewhere between the current needed to move down, and the max current your system can put. For an elevator, gravity helps you so it likely can be relatively low, probably 5-10A. Be safe about this though, and make sure your system doesn’t explode when at end of travel. You’re probably fine, but this is somewhat mechanically dependent. It’s also wise to temporarily set your current limits just above your detection value when homing, and put them back at normal/max afterwards. That way, in case of a bug or other error, you don’t have to rebuild things.",

                    "cooked": "Hi Tekdemo! Thanks for responding. We have some matters to discuss with your suggestions.\n\nThe first thing to cover is that the “elevator.stop()” method kills the current command being run if the boolean is interrupted. In order to interrupt said boolean we have to let go of our “while true” button. Therefore, “elevator.stop()” is a manual fix that we implemented to disable our elevator motors and lower the elevator the remainder of the way when we release the button used to “Set Home”.\n\nFurthermore, when our robot boots up, our elevator starts off touching the plate of the robot at its 0 position . So the robot starts at the 0 position, but when returning to that 0 position it fails to reach it and stops shy of it a couple of inches.\n\nWe also wanted to ask : How does output current end up changing if we are running it at a constant “motor.set(-0.1)”?\n\nWe doubt there are tuning issues as all of the upwards commands are followed promptly and how they should. Except, our lead programmer noticed that the “Set Home” issue ( where it doesn’t finish reaching its desired 0 position) also occurs when we try going from one elevator positions to a different one under it (like L4 to L2). Leading him to believe there might be a mutual error across our code not allowing us to go down properly.\n\nLastly, we have noticed that sometimes if we drive the robot while lowering the elevator, it goes all the way down, but not all the time, this is inconsistent. What is consistent, is our error occurs every time we stand still so after all it could be a mechanical issue, any ideas for what would cause this?\n\nThanks again ! hope you can continue to help us\n\n.",
