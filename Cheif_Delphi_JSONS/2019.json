It showcases how we’ve organized subsystems, structured our CAN wiring, distributed power, and labeled components to improve maintainability and field troubleshooting.\n\nOur key design goals were:\n\nClear subsystem separation\n\nSimplified and reliable CAN topology (using a star-style breakout to subsystems)\n\nClean and traceable power paths\n\nField-friendly layout to support quick debugging\n\nWe’re proud of the result, but we’re very open to community feedback or suggestions . Whether it’s ideas for layout optimization, component choices, or wiring strategies—any insights are welcome and appreciated!\n\nWiring Diagram – Segmented CAN Bus line 1920×1180 158 KB\n\nWiring Diagram – Segmented CAN Bus line 1920×1180 158 KB\n\nWiring Diagram – Segmented CAN Bus line 1920×1180 158 KB\n\nThanks in advance for your time and support!",

Out of curiosity, which software did you use to create it?\n\nI don’t have many suggestions, but I might recommend tightening the layout a bit so it fills the page more effectively for printing.\n\nIf this is a specific robot layout, and app allows, it could be helpful to label each CAN component with its ID and indicate each CAN network name — this would be especially useful for debugging.\n\nAlso, consider adding your team’s branding and the robot’s name. A printed version of this could make a great display for your pit and would be a valuable asset for the electronics subteam when presenting to judges.\n\nKeep up the great work!",

That being said, I had a few technical questions.\n\nTo terminate your superstructure CAN bus, wouldn’t it be much simpler to chain from the rio to your CAN distribution and finish at the PDH ? Doing this would let you terminate with the PDH ’s built-in resistor. Also, you should ideally be terminating with 120-ohm resistors either way.\n\nWouldn’t it be much simpler if you powered your radio directly with the Weidmuller ports, so you can eliminate the need for an RPM ?\n\nHow is your pigeon powered? I don’t see any power wires leading to it.\n\nShouldn’t your CANivore’s power have a 10A fuse instead of the 20A shown in the diagram? I thought you should fuse a device with 10A anytime 22 AWG is used.\n\nIf there’s any reason why you guys wire this way, then I’d love to hear it. We used to struggle with having enough MPM ports, and I thought splicing all your CANcoders into one port was a really interesting solution.",

                    "cooked": "Hey folks!\n\nSorry for the delay, but we finally have an updated version of our electrical diagram\n\nWiring Diagram – Segmented CAN Bus line_V.2 1920×1242 164 KB\n\nWiring Diagram – Segmented CAN Bus line_V.2 1920×1242 164 KB\n\nWiring Diagram – Segmented CAN Bus line_V.2 1920×1242 164 KB\n\nThe diagram has been updated with many of the suggestions you all kindly provided — shoutout to Jwal , YuvalGur-2231 , elctrilica , sokoloff , Chris_Mounts and others for the helpful feedback!\n\nWe’re still looking to improve , and I’d like to share some background on the design choices we made:\n\nThis structure was inspired by Team SCREAM (4522) , whom we met at a regional in Oklahoma. They run two independent CAN networks , and we adopted a similar approach:\n\nOne network comes from the CANivore , where all swerve-related components — Kraken X60 motors, CANCoders, and Pigeon 2.0 — are connected in series .\n\nAs a small note: we chose to wire all the encoders in parallel , which helps free up ports on the Mini Power Module and lets us power all of them from just one output instead of two, which we’ve seen some teams do.\n\nAccording to Team SCREAM, since encoders are sensing-only devices , they mainly need a consistent voltage , and current draw is minimal and stable, so wiring them in parallel is considered safe.\n\nThe second CAN line runs from the roboRIO to the “Serial” input , where we plan to use a CAN STAR device from Playing With Fusion ( link here ).\n\nThis will allow us to connect all of our subsystems (intake, elevator, shooter, etc.) in parallel.\n\nThe idea is that if one subsystem disconnects (e.g., intake motors), the others (like the elevator) can still function. We haven’t tested this setup thoroughly yet, so if anyone has experience with a similar config, we’d love to hear your thoughts.\n\nOn a related note , we’re wondering if each of these parallel CAN branches needs a 120 Ω termination resistor, or if a single one at the end of the main network is sufficient. Any insights would be appreciated!\n\nWe built the diagram using Lucidchart , with a bunch of custom SVG imports .\n\nMost of the parts came from this GitHub repo: GitHub - belaw888/FRC-Fritzing-Parts\n\nThe rest… we made the old-school way with MS Paint (not ideal, but it got the job done).\n\nLucidchart worked well enough, though after importing a bunch of SVGs we had to pay around $10 USD . Some alignment quirks aside, it was a decent platform overall.\n\nWe’re still open to feedback or questions — keep it coming!\n\nThanks again, and cheers from Mexico!",

Any insights would be appreciated!\n\nyou should only have the terminating resistor at the end of the main branch and make sure your branches are <12’’ (30cm)\n\nalso a slight nitpick but your main breaker is currently on the negative side of the battery which is the wrong side\n\nand another small thing you could have all of the can IDs on the motors to help programming team keep track",

This gave us huge issues when a short originating from the PDH blew the port’s fuse and killed every CANcoder and sensor downstream. Our solution to the shortage of ports was to use these quick connect boards for Krakens that let us power a CANcoder off of it, and the board came with its other benefits too. We were able to switch to an MPM and give each device its own fuse.",

The members of our electrical group were chosen for having demonstrated good workmanship so we do not expect, nor have we experienced,  short circuits due to poor workmanship. Thus we are only expecting the upstream fuse to provide protection against “extremely catastrophic events” such as intrusion inside our frame perimeter. As a matter of course, the majority of our control system components wiring are quite well protected so even a “casual frame perimeter intrusion” should not cause damage.",

We’ve always connected it that way and haven’t had any issues during inspection, haha.\n\nAlso, we’ll make sure to keep the CAN branches under 12’’ and only terminate the end of the main trunk. Super helpful!\n\nAs for the CAN IDs, great call — that’s something we’ll definitely prioritize in the full robot diagram for the season. For now, we’re mostly trying to shape this new topology so we can walk the students through the concept, but it’ll absolutely be part of the finalized season layout.\n\nThanks again! Let us know if you catch anything else.",

This gave us huge issues when a short originating from the PDH blew the port’s fuse and killed every CANcoder and sensor downstream. Our solution to the shortage of ports was to use these quick connect boards for Krakens that let us power a CANcoder off of it, and the board came with its other benefits too. We were able to switch to an MPM and give each device its own fuse.\n\nThanks so much! We’ll definitely keep that in mind.\n\nWe’re just curious — what specific advantages did you see from using those terminal boards? We’re still debating whether the investment is worth it given the cost. Also, we weren’t aware that this particular board was available from that supplier — it’s cheaper than the one WCP sells, but we’d love to hear what benefits you noticed when implementing it in your system.",

We’ve always connected it that way and haven’t had any issues during inspection\n\nR609 dictates that the electrical system be connected as shown in Figure 8-8. Figure 8-8 shows the breaker on the positive wire. There’s no electrical reason for it to break the positive instead of breaking the negative, but the rule IMO clearly requires breaking the positive.",
