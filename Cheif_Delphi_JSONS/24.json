                    "cooked": "Wow, what a great end to a season. Worlds was amazing, and we had a ton of fun at our regionals and are looking forward to off-seasons. I have created this topic because looking back on our season, one thing stood out: the issues with our limelights. This whole thing started when suddenly our Limelight 3G stopped turning on. We were powering this via POE, being injected into the VH radio, which was 12V regulated by a VRM. This method worked amazingly well until it stopped being reliable. We tried powering over the DC jacks on the limelight, and suddenly it started working again. After that, we turned off POE for all of our limelights and powered them over the DC jacks for the rest of the season.\n\nBefore we headed to our first regional, we always ran through an inspection checklist. When we got to the electrical portion, we tested the ground to the robot frame, where we heard the dreaded beep of our multimeter. There was a short somewhere on the robot. We started pulling fuses one after another until the beeping stopped. Finally, we discovered that the breaker on the PDH for the MPM had tripped. The beep subsided.\n\nWe then realized that one of our Limelight 3Gs had an internal short to ground, located on the frame of the unit. To fix this, we electrically isolated the limelight from the rest of the frame by adding plenty of liquid electrical tape and plastic washers. This resolved the issue temporarily, and we hoped it would pass inspection. Later, I took apart the affected Limelight to inspect for visible damage, but I didn't see anything obvious, though I'm not sure what to look for besides burnt PCBs.\n\nSince the replacement Limelight 3G wasn't going to arrive in time, we reluctantly decided to buy a newer LL4 with the Hailo upgrade, as we needed something immediately and were planning an upgrade anyway. At the regional competition, we used the LL4 alongside the problematic LL3G, and everything worked fine.\n\n Eventually, we replaced the shorted-out Limelight (which was otherwise functional, aside from the POE issue). Oddly enough, sometimes when the robot booted up, the Limelight would show signs of functioning (indicated by the rapid flashing green light), but we couldn't access its web interface. We tried unplugging and replugging both the Limelight and the radio, but the problem persisted. After a full power cycle of the entire robot—something we should have done earlier—the issue seemed to resolve. On the Chief Delphi forums, someone suggested that the RIO might only assign IP addresses for a short period, and the Limelight might take too long to boot. While that theory didn't fully make sense to me, I'd welcome any other explanations readers might have.\n\nThroughout the season, this particular issue kept recurring, and the only reliable solution was to perform a power cycle. Then, we discovered that the Hailo upgrade could improve the Limelight's ability to detect AprilTags. We enabled it during one of our regionals, and it worked well. However, during the next match, our odometry failed to update, and we couldn't align to score. Looking at the Limelight feed, we noticed it was drawing blue circles around the bolts on the AprilTags. Strangely enough, the blue circles indicated what the neural network \"thought\" were AprilTags, narrowing the image for the Limelight to focus on. Since this feature wasn't perfect, we decided to disable the upgrade for subsequent matches.\n\nAt Worlds, during inspection, the Robot Inspector detected a short circuit in the LL4. We traced the issue to the Ethernet cable, which somehow caused the short. Unplugging the cable resolved the problem temporarily, but plugging it back in reintroduced the short. Fortunately, the short measured 34 kiloohms, which likely met inspection standards. As someone inexperienced with electronics, I'm not entirely sure what that resistance value implies, so I'd appreciate any insights from more knowledgeable individuals.\n\nReflecting on the season, I've become increasingly frustrated with the reliability issues we encountered with the Limelights. They caused significant stress as we struggled to diagnose and fix problems. I believe that using PhotonVision with OrangePi might be a better alternative in the future, as we experienced far fewer issues with it. I've considered reaching out to Limelight support about these problems, but I wasn't directly involved in those communications, so I'm unsure of the specifics.\n\nIn conclusion, I wanted to share our experiences with these limelight issues in hopes that others might have encountered similar challenges and could offer advice or insights. I've noticed that other teams, like 118, have successfully used four LL4s without major issues, making me wonder if I just received two batches of faulty units or if there was something I did incorrectly. Your thoughts and theories are welcome!",
