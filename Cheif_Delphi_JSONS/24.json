                    "cooked": "This season ended on a high note, with an incredible experience at Worlds, but it wasn't without its challenges. Initially, our Limelight 3G cameras stopped working properly when we switched to POE power injection via the VH radio, regulated by the VRM. After some troubleshooting, we discovered that switching to DC power directly via the limelight’s jacks resolved the issue for the remainder of the season.  \n\nBefore heading to regionals, we always conducted a thorough inspection, including testing the ground connection between the robot frame and the multimeter, only to hear the alarming beep signaling a short circuit in the robot. We systematically pulled fuses until we located the faulty PDH breaker related to the MPM, which finally silenced the alarm.  \n\nFurther investigation revealed a short in the Limelight 3G, likely due to a connection issue on its frame. We fixed it by isolating the camera with electrical tape and washers, hoping it would pass inspection. However, when we disassembled it later, we couldn’t spot any visible damage, though I’m not sure what exactly to look for besides signs of burned PCBs.  \n\nWhen the replacement Limelight 3G arrived too late, we temporarily swapped in a new Limelight 4 with the Hailo upgrade, even though we were already planning an upgrade. This decision paid off during regionals, where the system performed well despite our previous issues.  \n\nEventually, we replaced the defective Limelight 3G, but oddities persisted. Sometimes, the limelight would flash rapidly, indicating detection of an AprilTag, yet remained inaccessible via its web interface. After multiple attempts to reset it, including cycling both the limelight and the robot’s radio, we learned that the RIO might only assign IP addresses temporarily, potentially causing delays in accessing the system.  \n\nThis recurring issue became a common challenge throughout the season, often requiring nothing more than a hard reset to resolve.  \n\nDuring one regional, we discovered that enabling the Hailo upgrade improved the limelight’s ability to detect AprilTags, so we used it successfully in the next match. However, the upgrade also caused the odometry to stop updating, leaving us unable to align for scoring. Upon consulting with a CSA, we learned that the blue circles appearing around bolts might indicate the neural network’s attempt to narrow down potential AprilTags, highlighting areas where the model struggled. This experience led us to opt against relying solely on the Hailo upgrade for now.  \n\nAt Worlds, during inspections, the RI detected a short circuit in our Limelight 4. Tracing it back, we found the culprit: a damaged Ethernet cable. Removing it fixed the issue, though reinserting it reintroduced the problem, leaving us puzzled. Luckily, the short measured 34kΩ, which presumably satisfied the inspectors.  \n\nThis season left me determined to explore alternative solutions, such as switching to PhotonVision, after dealing with enough limelight issues to pull out my hair. While we never confirmed whether our issues were due to poor batches or user error, seeing other teams like 118 successfully using four LL4s without problems made me wonder if we just had a string of bad luck. Any theories on what went wrong would be appreciated!",
