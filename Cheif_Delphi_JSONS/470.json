PhotonVision can provide the pose of an AprilTag relative to your robot. This gives you the positional error in X Y and rotation between your current pose and the target. You can then run a separate PID controller for each axis X Y and rotation to reduce those errors to zero. Make sure the PID outputs are scaled to match your drive input expectations e.g. between -1 and 1 if you're mimicking joystick input. Once scaled appropriately feed those outputs into your drive command in place of joystick values. This allows your robot to automatically drive toward and align with the AprilTag as if it were being manually controlled.",

                    "cooked": "Here’s my take on the problem: Although drive-to-pose logic heavily relies on accurate pose estimation, these are distinct processes. The optimal approach involves coupling your vision system with the robot’s pose estimator. Using tools like PhotonVision simplifies setting up 3D pose estimation with minimal effort. For a SwerveDrive platform, vision integration is straightforward via built-in methods, though documentation for setup is available at [link]. Without AprilTags, relying on odometry from swerve modules provides sufficient accuracy. Achieving precise positioning requires aligning the robot to a known pose, which can be done using either a HolonomicDriveController for direct path navigation or Pathplanner-generated routes avoiding obstacles like reefs. The simplest solution is employing HolonomicDriveController for straight-line targeting, applying calculated speeds directly to the chassis.\n\nAdvantages of integrating full-field localization and separating drive-to-pose and pose estimation include:\n- Greater flexibility in target placement, eliminating reliance on AprilTags\n- No requirement for AprilTags, provided cameras are positioned correctly\n- Ability to enhance drive-to-pose algorithms without compromising vision functionality\n- Integration of pose estimates into additional autonomous features, like intake motor control\n- Division of labor between vision and navigation teams, allowing independent development",

This was our first year trying it using a Limelight with MegaTag2. We got the code working relatively easily but struggled due to the lack of a practice field. We positioned field pieces in the lobby as best as we could. Our accuracy was often off by a few inches, making it hard to benefit from auto positioning during this year’s challenge. Without using auto scoring initially, we rewrote our targeting to do image-based positioning, which we tuned quite well. I’d love to understand full field positioning better—it seems powerful.

Without a specialized vision setup, we used four cameras set at the minimum resolution for Photon Vision, an open-source vision library for coprocessors, operating at 320x240 pixels. By simulating camera placements across the robot, we identified spots where two \"eyes\" on the AprilTags provided measurements from slightly different angles, albeit with considerable skew, when aligned closely to the reef. This division resulted in three distinct zones on the field:\n\n1. Reef zone: Within 6 feet of the reef, we observed accurate multi-tag and single-tag pose estimates.\n2. Intake station: Near the intake station, distances ensured error margins between 3-4 inches, allowing for less precise alignment.\n3. Elsewhere: Outside these zones, pose estimates were infrequent, relying heavily on module odometry, which often deviated by over 8 inches.\n\nWhile full-field estimations have issues, they weren't problematic due to our camera setup ensuring accuracy where needed. Additionally, weighting pose estimates differently based on their quality has proven effective.",
