There isn’t enough air in the system to go a second time,\n\nSo, in the scenario that we miss the rungs once, we can’t attempt to climb a second time. I’m not sure why there isn’t enough air in the system to allow us to do so- we have four air tanks (@ 120 psi / 60 psi). I also tested with 5 air tanks and there was no difference.\n\nDoes anyone have advice on how to get our climber to actuate and de-actuate more than once/ maximize the pressure in the system?\n\nThank you!!\n\nEdit: We are using two of these cylinders: https://www.mcmaster.com/6498K506/ . Stroke length of 22\", 1.5\" bore size, etc.\n\nWith two of these double acting solenoids: Air solenoid valve VUVG-LK10-B52-T-M5-1R8L-S | Festo USA\n\nWould using single acting solenoids help? I am also looking into purchasing faster acting solenoids as the current ones have 0.31 Cv. I’m not sure if this would significantly help, though?",

                    "cooked": "We were helping a team with climbing with pneumatics and they happened to have cylinders they wanted to use.  They had 2 cylinders that were 3 inch diameter.  I think the calculation would let that lift 800 lbs.  So the first thing to consider is how big and how much lift your cylinders can manage.  With 2 cylinders I wouldn’t consider anything larger than 1 1/2\".  I think you need at least 1 1/4\" typically.  If you have larger cylinders you might want to go down to using just one.  We lifted a robot with a 2\" which used a lot of air.  And then a ~1 3/4 cylinder which used less.  You also have to consider the stroke length, with the bigger cylinder using more air.  Above we had a 24\" stroke, which was a lot of air.\n\nI think you  should reasonable be able to lift the robot with 6 or fewer air tanks.  That is if you don’t have a lot of loss through usage or leaks.  If you use a lot of air, you can end up needing to refill the tanks.  You want them to be above 60 psig to have maximum lifting power.  When they are lower the air tank reservoir volume makes it tougher to get to higher pressure since you have to first fill the tanks.  In some cases being able to skip tanks and directly pressurize the cylinder may be better, but we always increased tank volume.  In our case we could get all the air we needed with an air lift aluminum tank.  But I don’t think that is necessary in this years game, we were dealing with the lifting mechanism also being an elevator in the 2018 game, so we had to use the cylinder up to 15 cycles during a match.\n\nThere are potential mechanical work arounds, but I would look 1) at cylinder size and 2) to verify you aren’t losing pressure and seek out any leaks.\n\nedit:  I forgot to say that our 1 3/4\" cylinder lift was not lifting the entire robot.",

                    "cooked": "If you are lifting the entire robot you should have ALL your air tanks at 120 psi and accept the speed hit that running through the regulator causes!  You may also want to have separate valves for each lifting cylinder to double your available flow rate.  Plus, that will help keep them sorta synchronized… This might be stupid, but you should verify that your compressor starts as soon as you hit the climb cylinders… Another thought:  If you have to extend and then retract under load you might want to regulate the “extend” function pressure MUCH much lower.  Maybe 5-10 psi?  This will significantly reduce the volume you spend on that low-force motion.\n\nOn to the exotic stuff that may or may not be allowed under the rules:\n\nI don’t know if its possible or allowable to do a regenerative cylinder connection, but that’s another thing that could help.  You would extend at low pressure and then flip a valve to connect BOTH sides of the cylinder together under the low pressure.  This would take up the slack in your system while spending relatively little air.  Then, you apply full pressure to retract.  There are three position valves that can do this sort of trick in the middle position. A quick exhaust valve on the extend side might speed up your cycle time a little bit, as the venting process could happen faster than the valve would normally do it.  Again, I -think- they are OK to use… One final trick would be to have a way to isolate one or more air tanks after they are used up, so you don’t end up re-filling them while you are desperately trying to get a lift.  Again, I’m not sure that you are -allowed- to do this trick.",

Also check if your high pressure side is filling up to 120 psi, the shut off switches  are not always set to the max.

This will significantly reduce the volume you spend on that low-force motion.\n\nThanks for your great tips. I along with my team are new to pneumatics so this is super helpful.\n\nWe need the stored pressure to be at 120psi, but the working pressure at 60psi as the FRC manual states. We do have two solenoid valves, one for each cylinder. The compressor does immediately start, but that it just isn’t enough to make up for what’s lost.\n\nFollow up questions: How exactly does one specifically regulate the “extend” function pressure, but not the “retract” function pressure? Do you know how to isolate an air tank and then use this air later on (if allowed)?",

You regulator steps that down to 60 psi before the solenoid valves.  This will maximize the energy storage. There’s three ways to get a lower extend pressure than retract. 1  Put a regulator between the solenoid valve and the extend port on the cylinder with a check valve to allow the reverse flow to get back to the solenoid valve.  You might want to hook the extend side of the two cylinders together to avoid having to buy and set two regulators…  Its possible you could find a pressure regulator with an integral reverse flow check valve.  I didn’t find one in the first couple of searches.  YMMV. 2  Use separate non-manifold solenoid valves for the extend and retract ports.  This will allow you to put a regulator on the inlet of the extend solenoid valve.  This requires more complicated controls and more valves but gives you direct control of the pressure you want!  You might get away with using one valve for both extend ports and living with one cylinder going up first. 3  Put a flow control valve with reverse flow check on the extend side and throttle it back a LOT.  Play with the timing and minimize the time that you are in extend mode.  Fiddly adjustment…  But its simple.  The idea is to prevent the cylinder from ever reaching full pressure.\n\nI would go with option 2 if I wanted to make my climb happen as quickly as possible.\n\nI don’t think isolating tanks is going to come out FRC legal, so I’d take that off your list",

If you instead reduce the extension pressure to 5psi as suggested above, it changes the recommended tank count to 4.  Of course, all this assumes you have no other pneumatics on the bot.

This minimizes the volume of air in the working lines between the valve and actuator, which in turn reduces the amount of air you’re venting on every actuation. It can also speed up actuation as you now have to let a smaller volume of air through the valve before the actuator and working lines are fully pressurized. I will say that more intentional pressure regulation and actuator size choice will likely have a larger impact overall than a few feet of tubing, but it all adds up.\n\nFesto also offers a valve similar to what you currently have with M7 ports instead of M5, which has a nominal flow rate of 340 l/min as opposed to the 195 l/min: Air solenoid valve VUVG-LK10-B52-T-M7-1R8L-S | Festo USA",

The thought was the elevator could operate on lower pressure through the match and only needed 60 psi for the climb.  Still was iffy.\n\nTurned out to be much easier to buy a 2-gallon tank designed for car suspension–equal to almost 16 clippard tanks…and air was limitless.  important to not ever let it go to zero because more than ten minutes to fill from zero between matches.  Big tank weighed same as four clippards.\n\nApproved in Wisconsin by Big Al himself. He insisted on  bolts holding it in, not zip ties.\n\nhttps://photos.google.com/photo/AF1QipNOt-w6k-ZWM3IwKL2huWtY-nm45mBAJnuVVh2-",
