                    "cooked": "As we finish the year and get ready for 2025 Reefscape , I’m looking for feedback on how you manage the code for your older robots.  As a 2024 rookie team, this is the first time we will be dealing with this.\n\nI see that most teams have a separate code repository for each year.  I originally thought that we’d keep a repository and associated Git history, and just use branches and tags to manage the transition, but have since “seen the light”, and plan to use a separate repository – though perhaps maintaining the Git history for the code that “carries over” from one year to the next.\n\nHowever, we don’t just want our 2024 robot (“Latch”) to be a historical artifact – we want to keep using it at outreach events and other demonstration opportunities, as an opponent when we practice with our 2025 robot, as a driver training tool, etc.  What do you do to keep a robot like that operational for one, two, three (more?) years?  Do you leave the code 100% as-is, and would that cause any compatibility issues?  Do you continue to update the code to the current 2025 (and beyond) WPILib and other vendor libraries, paying a “maintenance cost” to keep the robot operational?  And if so, for the common code that they share, is there anything you do to avoid making the same updates to two or three (or more?) robots?\n\nThanks in advance for your suggestions and advice.",

                    "cooked": "Lots of folks here recommending to build an in-house library, I’d like to push against that: building a library will just add unnecessary layers of complexity to your robot code and make it harder to maintain. One of the great things about FRC software compared to industry software engineering is that you can start over from scratch every year. You have no obligation to support legacy code and legacy software for customers, so don’t invent the obligation to do that by building a library to maintain year-to-year.\n\nThese days, the FRC software ecosystem is developed enough that it’s frankly easier to just copy-paste code year-to-year or to just rewrite stuff rather than developing your own libraries.\n\nRegarding OP’s original question, I’d recommend updating all of your hardware to use the latest versions of WPILib, vendordeps, etc. Supporting multiple WPILib versions is overhead that’s not worth worrying about, and it locks you out of being able to use any old robot as a development platform for things like autos or vision.\n\nMigrating old robot code to new WPILib versions shouldn’t be too complex - barring major changes like the Phoenix 5 → 6 migration. It’s worth paying the maintenance cost there in order to have multiple robots running the latest software versions. You can strip parts of your codebase out when migrating - a demo/development bot may not need autos or functional vision code. Sure, you may need to make the same changes across multiple robots, but those changes should be simple enough that even if it’s a bit of work, it should be fairly easy work.",

As long as the robot is assembled and working, we continuously update the code with vendordeps and WPILib updates so we can keep using it for demos and practice. Once the robot is disassembled, we archive the repo in GitHub. See Team Rosbots · GitHub .",

This process is usually harder than you might expect, but certainly way easier on a known working system.  This puts programmers in a good position to tackle the new 2025 robot.  NEXT year will be the year you have to make a harder decision about what to do with that 2024 robot.  The goal should be continual improvement and hopefully by 2026 that 2024 robot won’t seem as awesome and you’ll be happy to rob parts from it.",
