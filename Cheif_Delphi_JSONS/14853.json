American options looked complicated and prohibitively expensive, so designing our own seemed a good idea. The only other functional swerve in australia had been designed and used by team 4774 with some success, but were either complicated to machine or utilised slip rings. Recently team 4613 has revealed their machine using SDS Mk2/3 swerve, but again this is quite a costly endeavour. We wanted a swerve drive that was Reasonable .\n\nBased off of the cx20 by @nuclearnerd , this swerve drive aims to be as mechanically and electrically simple while retaining competativeness. We are fans of the NEO motor family, so the modules will be all brushless for performance and low weight. My team has a 6040 CNC router, metal lathe and 3D printer at our disposal, thus the reasonable design requirements were set.\n\nThe first prototype was basically the cx20 made of MDF and PLA. This drove and spun, so it was game on to progress.\n\nP_20200502_140906 2250×4000 1.18 MB\n\nP_20200502_140906 2250×4000 1.18 MB\n\nP_20200502_140906 2250×4000 1.18 MB\n\nWe made many design changes after this variant. Once the X-contact bearing, bevel gear and spur gear had arrived final tolerances could be checked. Dimensions such as the main bearing recession were innacurate, so had to be tuned. The plates were modified to suit the cheaper Ultraplanetary gearboxes from REV robotics. A 3/8\" hex shaft was used to transmit power from motor to bevel. While the baseplate remained aluminium, the top and inner rotating plate was trialed as our new favourite material, High Density PolyEthyline (HDPE) do to its ease of sourcing in australia, favourable mechanical properties and low cost. The top plate was extended to hold the UP straight as belt tension caused it to lean. It was found hard to accurately mill the main bearing recession with the 6040 mill so team 4802 lent their large Multicam CNC to machine four plates for us.\n\nimage_from_ios-6 3024×4032 1.39 MB ^ Aluminium from 4802\n\nimage_from_ios-6 3024×4032 1.39 MB\n\nimage_from_ios-6 3024×4032 1.39 MB\n\nP_20200802_150754 4000×2250 1.6 MB ^ HDPE mess at 7561\n\nP_20200802_150754 4000×2250 1.6 MB\n\nP_20200802_150754 4000×2250 1.6 MB\n\nAssembly was then fairly uneventful. Due to no suitable bevel gears with ⅜\" hex bore available we opted to 3D print that part for now. This remained the method for about 10 months up until WCP released it on their store about a week ago. The colson wheels were turned on the minilathe to reduce their thickness at the hub and allow bolt heads to be recessed. Due to a lack of imperial fastners the M5 wheel throughbolts were cross threaded into the WCP bevels. Nightmare fuel but very functional, no locktite required.\n\nP_20201212_164430 3000×4000 1.51 MB\n\nP_20201212_164430 3000×4000 1.51 MB\n\nP_20201212_164430 3000×4000 1.51 MB\n\nP_20201121_172632 4000×3000 1.48 MB\n\nP_20201121_172632 4000×3000 1.48 MB\n\nP_20201121_172632 4000×3000 1.48 MB\n\nP_20201212_181652 4000×3000 1.78 MB\n\nP_20201212_181652 4000×3000 1.78 MB\n\nP_20201212_181652 4000×3000 1.78 MB\n\nSS7.1 Section 1870×1748 353 KB\n\nSS7.1 Section 1870×1748 353 KB\n\nSS7.1 Section 1870×1748 353 KB\n\nThen a test base was designed using the readily available 3mm wall 50*25 aluminium extrusion from a local supplier. It was decided to also test an in-frame upside-down electronics setup, as the 2020 robot had a in-frame baseplate that was very space efficient but made for hard access to some places. This frame is deceptively heavy.\n\nP_20201220_190636 4000×3000 2.43 MB\n\nP_20201220_190636 4000×3000 2.43 MB\n\nP_20201220_190636 4000×3000 2.43 MB\n\nTesting was done using the inbuilt NEO 550 encoders as only one module had absolute encoders mounted, they are fiddly business. During the below test one module had broken it’s PLA printed bevel gear,  we were testing ABS vs PLA.\n\nDuring a pre-comp scrimmage the test setup got to stretch it’s legs more while testing some printed nylon gears. They gave out after about 15 minutes, but the drivebase never lost tracking on the modules despite still using incremental encoders. Software was rudimentry but it included multiple drive modes including car-like steering alongside translational movement. Apologies for the noise generated by our comp bot, being tested concurrently. Note that by this point two modules had stripped their bevels (the only ones still PLA), but some motion is captured in this video.\n\nHere is a rough BOM: SS7.1 Cost Spreadsheet - Google Sheets\n\nCost without motors is 236USD, or 300AUD. Including motors this rises to 302USD / 385AUD.\n\nMass without motors is 1.1kg, 1.7kg with motors.\n\nTo compare with the perhaps the best in the COTS swerve business, this is approx 80% of the SDS MK3’s cost and 80% of it’s mass (NEO versawheel variant). As this was the kind of thing we would have bought, that seems like a good outcome. Lest hope for more than 80% the performance. As I do not have a module on me, I am going by calculation here but they seem pretty spot on.\n\nThe NEO 550 is geared down a total of 90ish:1, to a steering speed of 1.5ish rps at 75% free speed.\n\nThe drive reduction is about 6:1 on the SS7.1 with a 4\" wheel, for a free speed of about 4.5m/s (14.7fps).\n\nThe intention is to use this drivetrain in the 2022 season, I will update this thread with our findings if they are significant/unique.\n\nAny advice, thoughts or quesions are most welcome.",

It feels more “refined” than just using the screw heads to retain it.\n\nI might opt for a full through bolt on the dead axle rather than individual bolts on each side. It would eliminate the cross threading issue. You can put a nylock nut on the end so that you can avoid using loctite. Replacing the wheel due to tread wear will be a regular thing and a through bolt will make it a lot easier to dis-assemble (no cross threading) as well as re-assemble following wheel replacement (i.e. don’t need to re-apply loctite to the bolts).\n\nSince you are using a dead axle, you may want to look at COTS billet wheels with replaceable tread. Then you won’t have to machine a bunch of wheels. You can have 2 sets of billet wheels and then just replace the tread when it wears out. You can build a template jig to pre-drill your tread and then just have a supply of tread in the drawer at comp.\n\nOther than that, the design looks really really solid.\n\nSo… Specs? Weight? Speed options? Steering speed?",

Then you won’t have to machine a bunch of wheels.\n\nBoo, hiss .   I mean sure, billet wheels are nice, and the extra bit of traction is valuable.  But I have had nothing but headaches personally with tread, and I continue to hear stories of frustration from teams that use it.\n\nWe haven’t been to our shop since March of 2020, but I was hoping that the WCP bevel gear could be installed into a Colson wheel without a lot of machining.   The gear should be able to be brazed into a tube that you push into the bore of the wheel.  But even if a bit of work on the lathe is required to fit the Colsons, doing so once per season instead of replacing tread every event is worth it to some teams.\n\nVaSIMR200:\n\nThe top plate was extended to hold the UP straight as belt tension caused it to lean\n\nThis surprised me, as the base plate is 1/4\" thick aluminum.  I wouldn’t have expected it to bend over such a short distance - perhaps it’s pocketed too much there? @waialua359 did you see any deflection in your version of this design?",

Effectively all the tread is gone and the CoF of that black plastic is a lot lower…\n\nSo, installing wheels will not be “once per season” in my experience. Your mileage (literally) may vary…\n\nI like your idea of brazing the bevel gear to a hub. But I think you would need to have some really good fixture to make sure that the gear was held true to the tube while you were brazing. Do these Colson dead hubs have the right hole pattern for the gear (sorry, I am too lazy to pull up the drawings myself and check)?\n\nBillet wheels are not the only option. There are plenty of other wheels that would fit a dead axle arrangement that would not require the extra machining to interface with the Colsons. Our Colsons are 1/2\" hex bore run on a live axle (with 1/2 hex bore gear on the same live axle). I was merely suggesting that the OP plan to replace wheels at least a couple of times per season and his current design seems to require some machining operations which just means that you need to do that additional work during the season to have an adequate supply of spares hot-ready at an event.",

Including motors this rises to 302USD / 385AUD.\n\nMass without motors is 1.1kg, 1.7kg with motors.\n\nTo compare with the perhaps the best in the COTS swerve business, this is approx 80% of the SDS MK3’s cost and 80% of it’s mass (NEO versawheel variant). As this was the kind of thing we would have bought, that seems like a good outcome. Lest hope for more than 80% the performance. As I do not have a module on me, I am going by calculation here but they seem pretty spot on.\n\nThe NEO 550 is geared down a total of 90ish:1, to a steering speed of 1.5ish rps at 75% free speed.\n\nThe drive reduction is about 6:1 on the SS7.1 with a 4\" wheel, for a free speed of about 4.5m/s (14.7fps).\n\nNote: edited original post to include this information.\n\nExtra tidbits:\n\nUsing HDPE parts instead of aluminium saves about 130g per module.\n\nThe lathe used to turn the wheels cost about the same as one module.\n\nSpark MAX controllers don’t like the SRX encoders and crash.\n\nWe are the third team in australia to design our own swerve. Cant C# made a all 3D printed one in 2017 but moved a total of 5m in competition (according to those there). The Drop Bears had swerve in 2018 of fairly traditional design, then made a differenct concept in 2019 that had the motor on the rotating component and used slip rings to pass the power. 775pro motors smell bad when burnt.\n\nSS7.1 stands for Swiggety Swerve 7.1\n\nShipping to australia is expensive",

                    "cooked": "If you are initializing at startup and then using the absolute encoder as an error detection (for a skipped belt tooth for example), you could have the encoder hooked up to the RIO rather than the SparkMax. The main code can read the encoders and send the initial position to the SparkMax to initialize the local control loop. You can then run periodic comparisons in the main code to detect a shift between the two signals and can implement a way to have the drivers re-initialize the zero position if you detect a difference.\n\nI don’t think you need to worry about the NEO550 encoder failing. If that were to happen, the NEO550 itself would stop operating as the controller would no longer be able to commutate power to the coils. With the UP gearbox, you probably don’t need to worry about shifts in the gearbox. I think the pressed on pinion is really solid and the output of the gearbox is a bolt circle, so there is really nothing in there that can slip. So, the most likely cause of error would be the belt skipping a cog. So you may want to set something like 90% of the angle of a single tooth of the belt as your error detection threshold. If you really believe that the belt is the only potential failure mode, then you could have the zero point increment in multiples of that that belt tooth angle.\n\nThe NEO 550 is geared down a total of 90ish:1, to a steering speed of 1.5ish rps at 75% free speed.\n\nThat seems pretty slow. With the NEO 500 built in encoder as your steering encoder, you should be able to able to increase that speed by a factor of 3 to 4. You may want to experiment with removing one of the stages of your UP gearbox. If you have a 3:1 slice in there, you may want to build a test module removing that slice and see what happens. I believe that it would still be easily controllable and you should have plenty of steering torque. Reducing the gear ratio will save a little bit of cost and weight but probably the biggest benefits will be reducing the backlash between the motor and the steering to improve your steering accuracy and improving the responsiveness of the module.",

We have noticed that when making fine tuning adjustments at slow speed (such as when placing a scoring piece in a goal) that the higher steering speed is beneficial.\n\nBut the main reason for our latest iteration was to get rid of a stage on our gearbox to reduce the backlash and improve the steering accuracy. It also resulted in a small weight and cost saving. The performance improvement going from 180 rpm to 300 rpm is not all that noticeable in terms of driving feel.",

Most of that is anecdotal.\n\nI probably need to put this in a different post but, since everyone’s looking.\n\nThe whole RPM /gear ratio thing has been just a way to convey each swerves setup and we all aware that it has its shortcomings which got me thinkin’…\n\nI personally would like to see, emphasize, and push that if folks want help with azimuth questions, they need to show the 0-90 degree step response graph showing the set point, reported position, and motor current vs. time both with the swerve off the ground and on the ground (not a theoretical/calculated graph but a real one).  Folks might be surprised at how long it takes to get a motor (no load) from 0 to full speed and back to 0.  If you want the PID tuned optimally, you need to be looking at this graph.  It also give you good info on how efficient you’re geared.\n\nIf memory serves me right, ours does it in 110-120ms with a 15-20 amp spike to go and a 15-20 amp spike to stop with about 80ms of the 120ms being cruise in the middle (don’t hold me to that. possible bad memory).\n\nQuiescent current to spin the module off ground would be nice also since that’s as low as the current will ever be.",

A teenager with good gaming hands can react faster than a 50-something.  Converting azimuth RPM into milliseconds for a 90 degree turn may help to visualize the timing:  300 RPM is 5 rev/sec, so 50 milliseconds to turn the module 90 degrees.  180 RPM makes the 90 degree turn in 83 milliseconds.
