It claims to be decently strong and half the weight of aluminum, and the price was 75% less. I was wondering if any teams have used this material or similar (particularly at 1/8 inch thickness) and know whether or not it’s viable to use this material.",

You can cut it with a utility knife in some cases–you can’t do that with aluminum sheet unless it’s super thin. Don’t use it in case of needing structural strength.

FTC robots can get away with a lot of things they shouldn’t be able to, including structural 3DP, abusing servos, abusing aluminum drawer slides with poor beam profiles, and much worse.\n\nHowever, FTC robots do not fly. Composite materials of this nature make sense for things that fly where minimizing weight is the absolute most important thing, but there are still strength and stiffness criteria to meet, and when the loads are predictable\n\nIf aluminum cost (espeically if you aren’t doing it in-house) is a problem, there are other mistakes that could be increasing cost. There are some bad pocketing patterns that are bad in terms of both strength to weight, and in terms of machine time that are somewhat popular. All of these patters put struts in places that don’t make a lot of sense, and use many more smaller struts, which requires significantly more time to machine. Avoiding these and sticking to the tried and true “connect the points of interest”, or not pocketing at all will reduce costs.\n\nExcessively tall parallel plates that try to include electronics and other stuff also significantly increase cost. Swapping them out for shorter plates that just do the drivetrain, and mounting the electronics and other mechanisms with other plates (which don’t have to be aluminum always) can also reduce costs, especially if a mechanism needs to be rebuilt.\n\nDepending on how your outsource is making parts, avoiding small radii corners lets you use larger endmills which reduces machine time even more.",

You’ll need to have a plan to introduce stiffness through structure. Taking aluminum plates and waving the “3/16” plastic!\" wand without any additional thought will not serve you well. 1/8\" will be a significant engineering challenge.\n\nTest how well a motor mounts to it, what happens to bolts that are tightened to it, how it flexes under load, how it’s supported while it’s driving a gear, etc - you’ll need conscious engineering design to get stiffness back, since you’re not getting stiffness for free from the aluminum plates anymore.\n\nIf you want to spend your season on design exploration of a lower cost and weight drivetrain and all the details that achieve that reliably, go for it. If you want to spend your season working on accomplishing game tasks, stick to an 1/8\" aluminum plate drivetrain.",
