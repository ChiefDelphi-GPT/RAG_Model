Using the WPI RomiReference project and the sample code in PathPlanner I have a bare bones implementation, without drivetrain feedforward or PID controllers, just the PathPlanner PPLTVController for path following.\n\nTrying to follow a straight line path the ROMI jumps wildly  forward and back. In trying to isolate the problem I simulated both wheel velocity and wheel distance measurements. Doing that, ROMI follows the path in a reasonable manner. Then I replaced simulated velocity with actual velocity measurements (using encoder rates from the encoder API). That too worked fine. If, however, I use the actual distance measurements from the encoders ROMI goes wild.\n\nLooking carefully at the wheel encoder distance outputs it seems that updates are occurring roughly every 60ms or so – sometimes more, sometimes less. The software is updating the ROMI state (pose, velocity) using the command scheduler periodic loop, at 20ms. This “jerky” distance updating and corresponding robot pose causes the path controller to overshoot and become seriously unstable.\n\nQuestions:\n\nIs the output I’m seeing from the ROMI wheel encoder (~60ms updates), typical?\n\nAssuming it is, what is the best way to deal with it? I’m trying to work my way up from simple to complex so, before resorting to drivetrain controllers (feedforward, PID ), is there some effective way to “smooth out” the wheel encoder updates?\n\nThanks –jon",

Simple commands to drive forward and back, as well as to turn a fixed angle, are not bad.\n\nThen I added PathPlanner to the mix using a PPLTVController. I figured that with real controllers and sysid constants I wouldn’t have to introduce an artificial small scaling factor – wrong. Path following with the controllers is just as crazy as it was originally: the system severely overshoots and then becomes chaotic. In spite of velocity limit being set (1 m/s) in the PPLTVController constructor this value, and the motor max effort in the SysId tool (7V) , both are exceeded (e.g. 30V).\n\nI tried adding an artificial scaling constant to the input speed request, and this allows the romi to slowly creep along the path, but even then it can sometimes go bonkers. I tried, instead, to zero out the PID controller Kp but that had no affect – overshoot with chaotic behavior.\n\nI’ve been following GitHub - DevilBotz2876/RomiTutorial2023: A step-by-step tutorial on how to get up and running with WPILib and the Romi Robot Kit including some more advanced functionality such as AdvantageKit, SysId, PID Control, PhotonVision, etc for guidance but unfortunately it is several years old and the Ramsette controller is deprecated. Also, for clarity I chose to use meters as the units instead of radians, as in the tutorial. I’ve double checked the SysId tool units and settings and all looks reasonable, including the analysis plots.\n\nAny suggestions as to what may be the problem? Has anyone implemented Pathplanner with a differential drive like Romi?",

The default is 9 m/s.\n\nLTVUnicycleController builds a lookup table from velocity to controller gains since it’s really expensive to do in real-time on a robot controller as slow as the roboRIO. maxVelocity determines how large the table is. It doesn’t actually change what the controller gains end up being: allwpilib/wpimath/src/main/java/edu/wpi/first/math/controller/LTVUnicycleController.java at v2025.2.1 · wpilibsuite/allwpilib · GitHub\n\nWe provide a way to change maxVelocity in case someone made a robot that goes faster than 30 ft/s, but basically no one should be adjusting that value.\n\nThe 2027 version of this class removes the lookup table because the MRC is a Raspberry Pi 5.\n\njonbarril:\n\nPath following with the controllers is just as crazy as it was originally: the system severely overshoots and then becomes chaotic.\n\nThe robot code runs on a laptop wirelessly connected to the Romi. This introduces latency into the control loop that gets worse if your laptop’s Wi-Fi driver is poorly written. Even small amounts of latency can make controllers unstable.\n\nThe Romi has really small velocity response time constants due to it being so light, which magnifies the latency issue. My post here shows what latency does to system stability:\n\nShooter Encoder? General Forum\n\nAssuming the latency can’t be fixed, the only other option is reducing the controller gains. SysId has a “measurement delay” slider that returns the optimal feedback gains in the presence of a pure time delay. It uses the math from appendix B.4 of https://file.tavsys.net/control/controls-engineering-in-frc.pdf .\n\nIf the latency is high enough, the optimal feedback gains will be super low, and you’ll have to rely primarily on feedforward to reach the desired pose. Of course, this isn’t as robust.",

The tool determined the following feedforward delays: position=61ms, velocity=91ms, and for feedback 91ms. This seems to be in the ballpark. However, this only effects the motor controller constants, not those of the path following (LTVUnicycleController) controller. Note also that I mentioned that I tried setting the motor pid controller constants all to zero to take it out of the picture, with no change.\n\nIt seems the problem may lie solely with the settings for the path following controller. I’ll dig into LTVUnicycleController some more but is there some straightforward way to turn down its gain without affecting the motor controllers, which seem to work fine with teleop and simple distance and duration commands.",

                    "cooked": "Wow, glad I found this thread since working on the same stuff. I had just been using the Romi-reference project and working on vision based autonomy. Then my Romi started to drifting during “straight” driving and it was time to get into PID control rather than just feeding raw speeds/voltages to the arcadeDrive.\n\nA few questions:\n\nI don’t think there’s a current automatic SysId routine for Romi, but we should be able to run the routines and then use SysId tool on the log file right? I did this but got “infeasible” constants from the tool so just wanted to check it’s something that should be possible in first place.\n\nIs there anything in the Trajectory Generation and Following with WPILib through the LTV Unicycle Controller step that won’t work with Romi and differential drive?\n\nAs mentioned above I had to add a simple PID Controller to my drivetrain class to track L/R wheel encoder counts and feed in zRotation corrections to get straight driving when joystick has no zRotation input. (teleOp trying to drive straight) In the context of path following is the LTV Unicycle controller going to take on that responsibility?\n\nIs there a reference implementation of the LTV Unicycle controller you can point to? The > wpilib tutorial notes it needs updating from the Ramsete controller. At a high level I’m looking for how to setup the command to run the path using the new controller.\n\nMy Romi gyro has drift of ~0.2 deg/sec even after calibration. It seems to be fairly steady so I was thinking I could add a Shuffleboard parameter to null that out with an aggregator that resets with each gyro reset in the code. Is this already accounted for somewhere in the standard approach?\n\nI’m on Mac so I think Choreo can be used to generate paths and potentially even command code? (may help with #4 above)\n\nThanks for any pointers. I am thinking about introducing Romi-based programming training in our program but need to get some of this stuff working to document & test it effectively. I would focus on the elements (like path planning, vision autonomy, code structure) that translate well to the competition bots. It would also be pretty interesting to make some miniature standard components like an elevator so kids could work on controls tuning.",

Is this a pattern you found from wpilib or just came up with this?\n\nBut it got me looking through more examples and I did see a more advanced implementation of differential drive in the DifferentialDriveBot than is used in the Romi example. Maybe it’s because of the (current) challenge of obtaining the SysId parameters for a Romi.\n\nI’ll move to this approach and that should align better with what Choreo is expecting in the robot code by default.\n\nI’ll check out the XRP as an option. One thing I really like about the Romi build of wpilibpi is the fact that you can drop a vision program right in there, plug in a webcam, and you are off to the races with autonomous vision in a way that should transfer easily to competition robot. I’ve seen some efforts at XRP but I think a bit less capable.",

Splitting the code up the way I did ues best practices of separation of concern and only writing code once.\n\nI put all the low level drive specific dependencies in separate subsystems – romi and xrp drive controllers and constants. And, put all code common to any differential drive – kinematics and odometry – in DiffDriveSubsystem, which uses DiffDrivable – implemented by Romi and Xrp drive systems – as a delegate.\n\nThis approach also allows the sysid code to be written once and used with any drivetrain – differential and holonomic.\n\nSince I was late to the ball the students forged ahead with a ball of code approach. With competition underway we’re not changing anything unless needed. Hopefully next year there will be more time and interest to institute good software practices.",
