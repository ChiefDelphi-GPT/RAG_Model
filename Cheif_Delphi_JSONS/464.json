This is our first season using Motion Magic. The elevator can go from ground level to its highest point in ~1.1 seconds.\n\n(Sorry for the low framerate)\n\nWe didn’t do much to tune the elevator this season, and want to work on making it faster. We’ve tried to tune the values, but it doesn’t get any faster than before, ending at about 90 rotations per second (reading motor values, not factoring in gear ratio). The two motors are both geared 5:1.\n\nI want to know how to go about tuning Motion Magic, and ensure that I’m not doing anything wrong. This may just be a top speed, but I want to be sure.\n\nThank you!\n\n(Apologies if this question already has a thread from another person)",

Our issue was above 200-220”/s2, the chains would slip or other mechanical problems and cause issues.\n\nI don’t think this is right at all, but when I tune these, I just make P really big (like 10x it, and maybe do it again). This forces the velocity and acceleration limiters to work more, and get to the actual profile.\n\nI would be plotting the accel and velocity numbers from the motor, and if you notice nothing changes when upping the limits, check P.",

This should at least give you an idea of what your maximum theoretical bottom-to-top speed is assuming everything is perfectly tuned. If this is still around the same speed that your elevator is currently at, you would likely need to gear the elevator faster.\n\nMake sure you have soft limits set and some robust hard stops…it can be a little scary when you run out of travel at top speed.\n\nOnce you know that your mechanism gearing allows you to move as fast as you want, keep in mind that Motion Magic is split into two parts, a motion profile and the actual PIDF control of the mechanism. Tuning the PID /feedforward constants just changes how accurately you track the requested position. You should be able to tune these with pretty conservative max velocity/acceleration limits, and they generally shouldn’t need to change much as you push faster. The max velocity/acceleration constraints on the motion profile are your knobs to tune how quickly you really want the elevator to move, bounded by what is physically possible with your gearing.",

                    "cooked": "It looks like your value of “90 rotations per second” is in terms of motor rotations? For comparison, a Kraken X60 at 12 V has a free speed of 100 rotations per second (or 96.7 rotations per second if using Phoenix Pro with FOC ). Your elevator motor won’t ever be running exactly at free speed since it still needs to output torque to keep the elevator up against gravity.\n\nI looked at your code and I think you would find value in increasing or removing your jerk value (edit: you appear to have the config commented out), and possibly in increasing acceleration. However, your cruise velocity is too high (it should be actually achievable). As others have suggested, you should definitely look at your motors’ status signals via Phoenix Tuner X, or with AdvantageScope connected to the Phoenix diagnostics server, in order to see what motion profile the motor is generating and how well it is following.\n\nIf you are looking for the absolute fastest motion possible, you may want to consider whether to use Motion Magic. The trapezoidal motion profile helps smooth out the motion and make it more repeatable, but it does mean you are limiting the acceleration of your elevator. Personally, my team used Motion Magic this season because our elevator would break if it accelerated too fast (which I kinda regret accepting), but the highest-ranked team in our district (9496, whom you may be familiar with) just used plain PositionVoltage (so, PID control with no motion profile). There’s also Motion Magic Expo , which generates the theoretically optimal motion profile for a mechanism based on given kA and kV values.",

I sadly can’t work with the robot until probably tomorrow night, but I do want to reply atleast once.\n\nKnufire:\n\nelevator manual full voltage up on a joystick and using TunerX to plot the velocity/acceleration\n\nDefinitely going to be doing this. We used example values for our PID during the season, so we’ll probably tune it fully tomorrow.\n\nkn4:\n\nHowever, your cruise velocity is too high (it should be actually achievable).\n\nI forgot about motor free speed when setting these values during the season (for some reason). We have cruise velocity set to ~95-105 right now I believe, the change just hasn’t been committed to GitHub yet. The acceleration is set to 600, though it acts about the same.\n\nkn4:\n\njust used plain PositionVoltage (so, PID control with no motion profile)\n\nGood idea! We’re using Motion Magic while tuning our motor PID , and then we might look into using PositionVoltage.\n\nSorry I can’t give better answers, since I don’t know certain details about the elevator. I’m going to try using this advice tomorrow. Thank you all again!",

Sometimes that needs to be increased to get more speed (but obviously be careful not to demand too much current and kill your battery mid-match). We’ve had problems where we are applying 12 volts but still not hitting a very high power, and watching current draw solved the issue quickly (we just capped out, so we increased current limit). Especially as you tell your elevator to be fast, you’ll become more likely to see high current levels.",

We believe 3:1 is possible, but don’t want to constantly run a higher voltage to keep the elevator up, since this will kill the battery very quickly.\n\nOnce this was done, we started tuning for this new gearing. It is faster already, and a lot smoother after some basic tuning.\n\nWe haven’t reached our maximum speed, so we’re going to work on fully tuning in the next week or so (depending on how much time we have).\n\nThank you all for helping!

We realized we were just using PositionVoltage, not MotionMagic.\n\nWe just never implemented it. I do want to experiment with MotionMagic Expo this off-season, though.",

However, I have heard great things from many teams; it is reportedly very good.\n\nAlso, since it is the off-season, try both in depth and see which you prefer.\n\nWhen I get around to trying MotionMagic (more specifically, MotionMagic Expo), I will return with more information and a more formed opinion.",
