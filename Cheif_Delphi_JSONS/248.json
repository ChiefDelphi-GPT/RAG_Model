From there, we came up with the idea of putting our swerve in closed-loop with PID control. But before we do, I'd like to ask some more experienced programmers for their opinions: 1) What were the results? 2) In your opinion, is it worth putting it in closed-loop? 3) What were the challenges during the process of switching to closed-loop? 4) Were there any downsides to closed-loop? If anyone can answer my questions, I'd appreciate it. The link to my code is below for anyone who's curious or needs to analyze it.",

Tuning the PID controller and feedforward takes a bit of time, but the benefits are significant. For example, we’ve incorporated friction compensation into our feedforward constants, which is excellent for small, precise movements. Drivers may not notice this, but in situations where minor changes in position can mean the difference between a miss and a score, this detail is notably recognized. This level of velocity control accuracy is very helpful.  \n\nIt’s also advantageous for motion tracking if you can instruct the robot how fast it needs to move, allowing the motors to handle the specifics of achieving that speed.",

It’s not worth using something like Motion Magic since you can pretty much treat the steering as an over-damped mechanism that has little acceleration/deceleration. Some teams use velocity control for the wheel velocity. I’d recommend also using on-board if you’re using Kraken or Falcon robots. I’m not sure about the Rev software/hardware stack: you might have to ask other users since their velocity control and low-count encoders have been an issue in the past. Could you clarify? Are you just asking about moving things onto the motors themselves? Because you can use PID control onboard theRio without issue, but the motors will be better.",

                    "cooked": "Closed-loop (feedback) control for the steering motor is essential. Feedback control of the drive motor is assumed, with nearly all speed control achieved via feedforward. Feedforward calculations determine motor voltage for desired speed, leaving minimal error post-tuning. A proportional gain adjustment is needed; excessively low values yield negligible benefit, while excessively high values cause oscillations or instability. Some overshoot may occur with high gains, though this is typically manageable. A moderate proportional gain ensures effective yet stable performance.\n\nWhile NEO/SparkMax presents challenges due to velocity filtering adding time delays, their impact diminishes with faster-moving robots like shooters. Swerve modules with low mass experience limited velocity filtering effects, allowing for effective speed control. NEOs may suffice, but Vortexes, Kraken, or Falcons are preferable for swerve applications.\n\nClosing the loop on module speed addresses two primary concerns: mitigating speed discrepancies among modules, particularly due to varying frictions, and enhancing chassis speed control for precise autonomous navigation. Both scenarios necessitate robust module speed control to minimize corrections from higher-level systems.",
