Is there something your team does differently, and you haven’t had issues since?\n\nI want to get to the stage where I can easily diagnose issues (and not spend 50 hours staring at wires).",

Now if you are sure its red and definitely not orange then for some reason its showing two different states which is coast mode and reverse mode. Not sure if that was what you were looking for but thats what the colors mean. Now the CAN issue, remember the CAN you can track from PDP to Rio or vice versa. Now the first thing I do is look if the CAN wires are backwards (green to yellow) if not that then look if the CAN wires are connected to each motor controller is backwards like (ex: motor controller (mc1) has a green connected to mc2 then has a yellow connected to mc3 and so on) there could also be a bad wire but highly unlikely and if all else fails I’d rewire lol",

Break the CAN at some point and  check the resistance towards the termination and towards the RIO.  On both sides you should see 115-125 Ohm resistance.   If you see more you have a break or a high resistance connection in that direction, if you see less you have a short.  You can keep working toward the bad connection.",

We are using the Molex connectors and love the reliability.\n\nKeep wire runs as short as possible. Once someone created a loop to secure excess wires - that really messed our signals.\n\nDetailed plans so we can easily trace the path.\n\nGreen to green, yellow to yellow. This is why we like the Molex connectors as our approach prevents plugging in the wrong way\n\nDouble checking the CAN id of devices before they go on the robot. Devices with the same id can cause issues. Based on your description this would be the first thing I check.\n\nWire gauge, if your wires are too small (ie. 24awg) it is much harder to strip and crimp the wires. We found 20awg to be a great option.\n\nLook at how you prep the wires to install into the roborio and pdh. Do you use ferrules or tin them? How do you avoid strands sticking out?\n\nWhen stripping wires take time to measure them to ensure they meet the requirements for the connector you are using. Take time to watch and read the documentation from the manufacturer.\n\nCAN wiring is the nerve network for your robot, methodical, precision are the words to live by!",

Would this be a tell-tale sign for something?\n\nBy “everything turns yellow”, are you saying that the status LED on each SparkMAX on your robot becomes solid yellow? Solid yellow is the status code for a valid idle signal for a brushed motor in coast mode.  Are you running all brushed motors (e.g. CIM , 775pro, BAG) with your SparkMAXes?  Have you set them all to coast mode?  If you are running NEOs, NEO550s, or Vortexes, you should expect to see cyan (light blue) on those SparkMAXes at idle if they are in brake mode (most common) or magenta (pinkish purple) if they are idle in coast mode (less common).\n\nI’m assuming that you are using all V2 CAN cables with the external wire loop at the white connector for your SparkMAXes if you can unplug a CAN cable from a SparkMAX and the rest of the CAN bus stays up and functional.  Are those the cables you are using?  If not, I’m wondering what kind of CAN bus topology you might have.  Are you running a straight daisy chain from the roboRio to each CAN device sequentially and then ending at the PDH / PDP ?",

                    "cooked": "There’s a lot of things that can go wrong with CAN tbh but usually I’ll start with double checking that CAN is wired and terminated in both ends To do that I’ll get a multimeter and test the resistance between the low and high sides and double check that the resistance is 60 ohms. You should also check for continuity\n\nbetween the high and low side to see if there’s any shorts\n\nbetween the beginning of the yellow wire to the end to see if there’s a break\n\nsame for green side\n\nWith that you can test your connections and see whether there’s a break or a short in the chain. Then I usually check all the connections (either WAGO, locking Molex, or soldered connections) My team (5032) stopped using wagos and now we just primarily solder all our connections, I’ve had a lot of problems with wagos and don’t like them for signal connections overall. If that doesn’t work then just isolate each component one by one and see what component/connection is the issue. It takes a while but it’s worth it if it means you can make your wiring better. Some other tips I have are\n\nkeep can wires twisted to reduce interference\n\nkeep can separate from power, usually I try putting our power wires on a bottom layer, and then put can and other signal wires above.\n\nthink about your CAN topology and your wiring scheme/cable management well ahead of time, good electrical takes a lot of planning and messing around to see what works for you. Stick to the guidelines and plan everything out beforehand and you should be fine.",
