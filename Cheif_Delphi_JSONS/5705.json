                    "cooked": "Hello!\n\n[short intro thingy] This is the new Spires Robotics teams blog, and since this is our first blog of the current pre-season, I’ll just say what we plan on blogging about. Mainly posting about what we did during the week, and what we plan to do further, upcoming events we’re looking forward to, asking for help, etc. You know, basic boring robotics things. Maybe I shouldn’t say boring, but it’s whatever. We are a group of 8-12th graders interested in CAD, engineering, coding, building, and much, much more. Please, if you have any recommendations of any sorts, please tell us, we really want (need) help and feedback!! [TUESDAY] Last Tuesday (nov 19), if im being honest, some of us were goofing off. (Hats off to the people who were actually staying on task lmao). Matea and Janet were building their prototype for grabbing a box for our robot, while Nathan (our captain!!) did who knows what (I wasn’t paying attention), probably prototyping as well. Noah and Benjamin were coding, and Leah, Everett and I were sketching ideas for a new shirt design and prototyping!! IMG_1341 4032×3024 1.87 MB Janet and Matea building their prototype!! With the help of one of our coaches, of course.\n\nIMG_1341 4032×3024 1.87 MB\n\nIMG_1341 4032×3024 1.87 MB\n\nIMG_1333 4032×3024 2.78 MB Ben and Noah coding\n\nIMG_1333 4032×3024 2.78 MB\n\nIMG_1333 4032×3024 2.78 MB\n\nI’m not sure entirely what they’re coding, but they look focused!! (I asked and I forgot:,) ) IMG_1331 4032×3024 2.88 MB IMG_1336 4032×3024 2.59 MB Everett and Leah working (and me!!)\n\nIMG_1331 4032×3024 2.88 MB\n\nIMG_1331 4032×3024 2.88 MB\n\nIMG_1336 4032×3024 2.59 MB\n\nIMG_1336 4032×3024 2.59 MB\n\nWe didn’t get far into the prototyping Tuesday but… we got pretty good shirt designs!! I’m not gonna put it here cause it’s not finished, but it’s pretty nice!!\n\nIMG_1342 4032×3024 2.64 MB Mac and one of our other coaches 3d sculpting!! (I think) They also seem pretty focus unlike Leah Everett and I but… it’s fine!! I’m sure they got through a lot.\n\nIMG_1342 4032×3024 2.64 MB\n\nIMG_1342 4032×3024 2.64 MB\n\n[THURSDAY] Thursday (11/21) was quite uneventful. Leah’s little sister joined us today however!! We hope to see her next year to join us! Coach Mike told everyone nicely ** that if we don’t start actually getting our prototype ready, we might be screwed in season. So, Leah and I teamed up and did some of that!! We didn’t get very far, but it’s good enough. I didn’t take any photos of it because I forgot, but here are some photos of everyone working today!!

Anyways, we’re all in teams for building prototypes and the best one will be chosen. The teams are Leah and I, Matea and Janet, Everett by himself, Leo by himself, and Nathan by himself!! The people by themselves are kinda independent (kind of because Everett isn’t).\n\n[END] Although this week was somewhat uneventful, it was fun! Doing shirt design and building (and using the bandsaw) is really cool,\n\nand I probably will have to look forward it next meeting. We like to have a lot of fun here in Spires Robotics, and I hope we could share some of that with you : D!!  Anyways, I kind of wrote this at home, so if the next Weekly Adventure looks totally more proper, it’s because one of the coaches told me to use more mannerism. Anyway, please tell us any ideas you have for us Spires Robotics, and sorry if this was an uneventful week. Hopefully next time it’ll be more fun. Buh byee!!
