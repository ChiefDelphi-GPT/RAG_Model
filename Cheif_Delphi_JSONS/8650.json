                    "cooked": "After experiencing some weird behavior I created a test jig and measured the angles returned by the absolute output of two REV Throughbore encoders and found significantly out of spec error.\n\nTLDR : 2 REV Throughbores appear to have a maximum absolute angle error ~10 times higher than the value specified in the datasheet and I have no clue why.\n\nWe’ve been testing our MAXSwerve modules and noticed occasionally at least on of our modules would look slightly off on the steering angle. We did a quick diagnostic and discovered moving the module at 90 degree increments (referenced with a level) that at one increment the measured angle was ~2 degrees off the actual angle while it was accurate at the rest. Swapping the Throughbore actually caused this to become visibly much worse (didn’t measure but looked like 5 degrees).\n\nTo track down where the issue was I made a test jig and measured the angle error at 15 degree increments using just a Throughbore wired to a SparkMax with the absolute encoder adapter. The Spark was then connected to a computer via usb-c off robot and the angle read in REV Hardware Client.\n\nThe jig was as laser cut disk and pointer, the disk having marks at 5 degree increments. The Throughbore was bolted to the disk with a hex shaft through it with the pointer on the hex shaft. I’m quite confident the jig was more than accurate enough to indicate if the error was a serious as it initially appeared but I’d appreciate any concerns or criticisms. image 711×948 55.2 KB Back side of jig (no wires attached) image 711×948 70.1 KB Front side of jig\n\nimage 711×948 55.2 KB\n\nimage 711×948 55.2 KB\n\nimage 711×948 70.1 KB\n\nimage 711×948 70.1 KB\n\nAfter assembling the setup there was no visible eccentricity or significant run-out, and I could not feel any backlash between the pointer and the encoder bore.\n\nFor each trial I begun by aligning the pointer to one of the four major angle marks and zeroing the encoder in the hardware client. The conversion factor was set to 360 so the reading in the hardware client was displayed in degrees. I then moved the pointer in 15 degree increments (I have limited time and sanity and was not prepared to do 5 degree increments) aligning it as best I possibly could by eye to the marks looking from a top down view to ensure no offset from perspective and recorded the measured angle in a spreadsheet. Each trial took points from the full rotation, ending back at the start to confirm it read 0/360 back at the start. Any positions with significant error (> ~3 degrees of error) were returned to after completing the trial to confirm the values were correct.\n\nI ran 5 trials total. The total set of hardware tested was:\n\n2 Throughbores: #1 was the encoder from the original problematic module, #2 was brand new\n\n1 new JST PH 6-pin Extension Cable (long 6 pin to 6 pin ribbon cable)\n\n1 new 15 cm JST PH 6-pin Extension Cable (short 6 pi to 6 pin ribbon cable)\n\n1 new Absolute Encoder Adapter (used in all tests)\n\n2 SparkMaxes: #1 was newish use briefly for prototyping and #2 was taken fresh from the packaging\n\nI also tested reverting firmware from 24.0.1 to 1.6.3 on the SparkMax.\n\nNote : I did not try another adapter because a. it has no active components and b. it was already different than the one on the swerve drive.\n\nTrial 1: Throughbore #1 , long extension cable, SparkMax #1 , 24.0.1 Trial 2: Throughbore #2 , long extension cable, SparkMax #1 , 24.0.1 Trial 3: Throughbore #2 , 15 cm extension cable, SparkMax #1 , 24.0.1 Trial 4: Throughbore #2 , 15 cm extension cable, SparkMax #2 , 24.0.1 Trial 5: Throughbore #2 , 15 cm extension cable, SparkMax #2 , 1.6.3\n\nIt appears that the error can be isolated to the encoders themselves. Encoder #1 had a peak error of 6.7 degrees and encoder #2 had a peak of 5 degrees. The error followed a similar shape between encoder #1 and #2 . All runs of encoder #2 yielded extremely similar data (note the shift between trial 2 and trial 3 is due to the pointer being moved by one flat on the hex shaft (the data is shifted by 60 degrees, you can check if you don’t believe me).\n\nHere is the measured error for trial 1: Data: Encoder 1, Long Cable, Sparkmax 1 - Google Sheets\n\nHere is the measure error for trial 2-5: Rev Throughbore Error (Encoder 2) 1110×686 65.2 KB Data: Encoder 2 Combined Data Sets - Google Sheets\n\nRev Throughbore Error (Encoder 2) 1110×686 65.2 KB\n\nRev Throughbore Error (Encoder 2) 1110×686 65.2 KB\n\nThe datasheet for the sensor used internally suggests a maximum nonlinearity of +/- 0.5 degrees at room temperature which is far from the measured accuracy. @Greg_Needel could REV provide any insight on the accuracy you have measured or any potential causes of this problem?\n\nThe error appears to follow somewhat of a sine wave although there are 4 full periods from the first encoder but only 3.5 from the second encoder.\n\nAnother curious behavior that I ran out of time to collect data on was the change in values when the encoder was spun at a higher rotational rate than the slow movements between set points. Giving the encoder a few spins by hand seemed to significantly change the error at most or all data points (+/- ~4 degrees) although I cannot comment on there being any improvement to accuracy or pattern to this behavior.\n\nI’m not sure if this an isolated problem, but it seems that the other modules look correct and I can’t find any mention of this occurring online so I’d imagine so. I’d love to hear any suggestions for possible causes or other things to test and will continue to test myself. I plan to test one more encoder, characterize the change caused by spinning the encoder, and connect the sensor to a roborio to compare the absolute and relative outputs side by side.\n\nPlease share any thoughts, ideas, or experiences with similar problems.",

                    "cooked": "So haven’t had much time to do testing but I briefly tried a third encoder and much more interestingly two encoders on one shaft reading the relative and absolute outputs on a roboRIO.\n\nI’ve got logs now (see bottom of post)\n\nSo I grabbed a third encoder (also never used, bought this year) and put it in the jig. I made sure my hex shaft was aluminum as suggested by @nuttle . I didn’t take the time to record all the data because after randomly sampling a few data points the error was 3 or more degrees in a few places. At that point I was convinced either my testing methodology was bad, there was some external source of error, or I’m really not losing my mind and these encoders are not as accurate as they should be. I went to the other side of the building to test if there was any source of interference in our shop. No dice.\n\nSo to test if there was some random issue with the pwm signal I connected the absolute and relative outputs to a roboRIO and logged the data. They were spot on minus a negligible amount of error (~0.15 max) which is attributable to differences in resolution between the two outputs, timing differences, etc… image 1555×942 43.2 KB Absolute vs Relative Output over a range of angles (y axis in degrees).\n\nimage 1555×942 43.2 KB\n\nimage 1555×942 43.2 KB\n\nThis saved my sanity. I bolted two encoders together and put them on the same shaft. I separated them as much as I could to avoid their magnets interfering. image 713×950 65.5 KB Encoder setup image 713×950 97.9 KB Wiring to roboRIO (ignore the mess this is electrical’s training board).\n\nimage 713×950 65.5 KB\n\nimage 713×950 65.5 KB\n\nimage 713×950 97.9 KB\n\nimage 713×950 97.9 KB\n\nWith the absolute and relative outputs of both encoders wired to the DIO on the RIO I spun the shaft to generate some data. image 1555×942 49.4 KB Blue and yellow are encoder 1, Red and purple are encoder 3. The encoders follow each other closely for a majority of the rotation, but over certain regions separate to varying degrees. This particular peek in difference is just shy of 5 degrees. The difference doesn’t keep a consistent sign either.\n\nimage 1555×942 49.4 KB\n\nimage 1555×942 49.4 KB\n\nAt this point I have no idea what to do, but I’m pretty confident this issue is in fact real and not something I’m doing wrong. I’m emailing REV support this data and inquiring if they’ve done internal testing on the accuracy and have data they can provide or any insights on what may be wrong.\n\nIf anyone has any thoughts or similar experiences please share.\n\nLog file: Two_Encoders.wpilog - Google Drive Code (minus imports and other files that are empty.
