As a background, we already have a CNC mill that works decently with reasonable accuracy and speed.\n\nMy team has been discussing getting a laser cutter for a while to increase prototyping speed and (apparently) ease to use compared to a CNC. But now getting a laser welding machine has come into conversation, and our mentor says we can only get one. Another mentor is leaning towards laser welding, but I feel like it won’t be as useful as a laser cutter (again I’m not an expert so I turned to CD ).\n\nIf people could give a recommendation, and maybe a recommendation on a specific product, I would be very happy.\n\nEdit: Our budget is 5k USD.",

If it breaks, you don’t have a welder and you need to start adding L brackets and gussets. Which is why I do that from the start\n\nThat being said, a regular $3k laser isn’t going to cut metal. It’ll do wood and acrylic (the plastic you shouldn’t use). Its usefulness is basically prototyping things out of wood, as well as making signs and fundraising gadgets. Still, I feel it is more useful than a laser welder for FRC\n\nI have access to both, and I only used the laser cutter last year, but not for any robot parts",

Potentially great for iterative prototyping.  Not so useful for comp bot parts.\n\nI really don’t have any experience in laser welders. I suspect 5K is not enough. 5 grand will get you a great MIG/TIG  setup that will weld Al and steel. Probably more versatile than a cheap laser welder.  Keep in mind welding needs to be done either in a well ventilated area or with the proper vent hood. The arc will need to be shielded from other occupants.",

I am not a great welder so my welds aren’t as strong\n\nI’ve seen plenty of teams weld stuff. I know 67 had welds their 2022 climber and I’ve seen other teams with welds too that appear to work successfully\n\nLaser welding is a little tricky to get right, but it does for sure produce clean good welds when done right\n\nLaser welding doesn’t use any extra filler material (unless you have a special attachment). It just melts the two surfaces together. It is not as strong of a bond as a MIG or TIG weld, but it is smaller and cleaner\n\nAlso, please be careful. I have a few shirts with holes in it from laser welding. It will blind you if you’re not careful",

They’re also quite good for cutting Delrin which is not a bad plastic for FRC use. I don’t recommend polycarb unless you’re experienced, have excellent ventilation, and a fire extinguisher nearby, but it can be cut. I’ve just never had a good experience cutting it. If you put a lot of time and effort into learning how to run the laser well, you can get some really spectacular and accurate results. It’s second to none for sheer accuracy, especially on tight corners. A mill/router might be able to compete, but they can’t do the very fine details (like sharp inside corners) that a laser can, and routers in particular seem to have a tendency to wobble a bit on thicker/tougher materials. A welder imo doesn’t offer too much utility for FRC unless it’s something that can easily be replaced and isn’t too difficult to weld, and even then I’d go with bolted joints over welded.",
