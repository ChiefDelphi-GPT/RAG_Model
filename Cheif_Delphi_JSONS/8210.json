                    "cooked": "Vendors, please work together and follow 1 standard\n\nFirst of all , before I start getting bashed on, as my profile says, “Just to clarify, I’m not dumb, I am just learning”, but also I love what all vendors in FIRST have done and have been doing for the community.\n\nHowever, I have started to see some components become unstandardized which is causing this xkcd meme to keep coming true, and I hate it.\n\nFortunately, the charging one has been solved now that we've all standardized on mini-USB. Or is it micro-USB? Shit.\n\nThere are a few things that I would like to say but I feel like there will be others in the community that would also like to say something, as I could miss some things, they can happily post in this thread.\n\nFirst : MAXSpline vs SplineXL Yes, MAXSpline was released last year while SplineXL was this year but there are compatibility issues with both\n\nWCP 2023-24 | Product Release & Updates General Forum\n\nWCP 2023-24 | Product Release & Updates General Forum\n\nWCP 2023-24 | Product Release & Updates General Forum\n\nThere will certainly be compatibility issues that may come across but if there was just 1 standard to the spline, this would be solved. I really, really love what @R.C and WCP are doing with SplineXL by keeping it open and allowing other companies to build/design around SplineXL.\n\nWCP 2023-24 | Product Release & Updates\n\nDesigning for Compatibility:\n\nAny team or company may build off SplineXL, royalty free for competition or commercial use.\n\nIf vendors would like to build around the SplineXL Interface, please shoot us an email and we can assist with tolerances/gauges, etc.\n\nSecond : Motor Shafts (Not really that big of a deal) When the NEO was first released, it was marketed as a “Drop-in replacement for CIM -style motors” as they have the same shafts, which is amazing! But then the Falcon 500 came out with their specialized shaft. Okay, fine, we just have to deal with it. It had its pros and cons but we went on. Now, the Kraken X60 has a completely different shaft (SplineXS), basically making all Falcon accessories useless, especially since the Falcons haven’t been in stock since the end of the 2023 season . It would have been nice if the Kraken X60 and the Falcon 500 shared the same spline but I know there was some stuff behind the scenes that possibly led to having to change the shafts, but still. We just have Falcon 500 accessories sitting, waiting to be used, which they probably won’t ever since we can’t order new Falcon 500s.\n\nThird : Wires For the longest time, we have had motor controllers have 12awg power wires and 22awg CAN wires, but now, the Kraken X60 comes with and is recommended to be used with 10awg for power and the SPARK Flex comes with 26awg CAN wires.\n\nTDH, I don’t mind the 10awg wires for the Kraken X60 as the Anderson Powerpoles 1327 series (Which we all have been using in FRC for the longest time) PP45 connector supports up to 10awg. My only ick is that, as most teams slowly transition to inline wagos, they only support up to 12awg. I am glad WCP sells the PowerPole Adapter Board to use 10awg(or 12awg if you want) to just make your own long cable from the Kraken X60 to the PDP / PDH without having to use the cable that is provided and have a connector in the middle to extend which is an extra point of failure.\n\nNow with the 26awg wires for CAN , I very much do mind. Almost all wire strippers that you can find only go down to 22awg, which includes automatic and manual wire stripers. If you want to use manual stripers, it probably won’t even strip the insulation, but if you use automatic strippers, that can break almost all the strands. I understand if it’s because of mechanical constraints but still.\n\nREV Robotics - SPARK Flex and NEO Vortex General Forum\n\nYou are giving teams compatibility issues as certain connectors teams use don’t go up to 26awg, so now, they have to buy new connectors.\n\nREV Robotics - SPARK Flex and NEO Vortex General Forum\n\nMolex SL crimper in kop Electrical\n\nFourth : Connectors I mentioned about Andersons and Wagos in the wires section of this post. While both have their pros and cons, they are consumables and these are not the connectors I am worried about. I love using them. I would only recommend, as I mentioned earlier, to use 12awg to be able to use both interchangeably. The connector I would like standardized is the DuPont connector on the CAN wires that are pre-crimped. Let me explain why. For a while, I have been the type of person to use what is given to me. When I see a motor controller with DuPont connectors pre-crimped, and the wires are long enough to reach the other motor controllers with the connector, I will take advantage of that and use the retention clips, but every time I suggest just using the pre-crimped DuPont connectors to other people like on CD or the unofficial FRC discord, I get told its a bad connector and you should use a latching connector, like Molex SL. I am not going to waste precious build season time cutting the end of each CAN wire, then strip, and crimp a new terminal hoping they are good enough, especially with how small they are, mistakes are going to happen which will require students to cut and try to crimp again. But, if companies, like Molex, are willing to work with FIRST to get us a Molex SL crimper, or even work with companies like WCP to have the connector on the PowerPole Adapter Board and provide links in CD to the respective connector, I don’t see why companies can’t move to have Molex SL connectors for CAN .\n\nAnnouncing Kraken X60 powered by Talon FX! General Forum\n\nThe only downside I see with using the Molex SL connector is if you want to use PWM control other than CAN cause the RoboRIO uses DuPont ends.\n\nOverall, in my opinion, FIRST should be about getting students to learn, not having to be stuck in an ecosystem. Yes, each ecosystem has its benefits, but just imagine if everyone came together to make 1 universal product. Things would be so much easier, but of course, we, unfortunately, don’t live in that society.",

The spec was way too big and got vendor complaints. In my opinion, the real problem is vendor motor controllers trying to do too much.\n\nThe API ends up being as big as WPILib’s current API surface area (aka huge) because vendors are basically repackaging a bunch of WPILib functionality (DIO, AIO, PID , quadrature encoders, duty cycle encoders, motion profiling, motor control).\n\nYou can either organize the API as a kitchen sink interface ( CTRE ), or as separate WPILib-esque objects for each feature (REV). The former has discoverability issues due to the sheer size of the API, and the latter has discoverability issues because features are spread out without a usage map.\n\nFor-profit parties also see APIs as a product differentiator, so they don’t have an incentive to standardize.\n\nThis could have a smaller scope and let vendors innovate in the API space instead. Vendors probably wouldn’t like the limitation though, and it doesn’t address teams’s API divergence complaints at all.\n\nFurthermore, this change would require significant firmware re-engineering for every CAN device. I could only see it happening for the 2027 control system refresh.",

It would have been nice if the Kraken X60 and the Falcon 500 shared the same spline but I know there was some stuff behind the scenes that possibly led to having to change the shafts, but still.\n\nFor what it’s worth, I expect SplineXS to be the definitive spline shaft going forward, unless Vex somehow puts Falcons back into production and manages to recapture the market. With the Neo Vortex having a swappable shaft, REV should be able to put out a SplineXS shaft and ensure its usage across vendors.",

Then 1/2 inch rounds won’t work for regular hex either for dead axles unless we machine them on the lathe. Can all hex axle stock be rounded by default. We don’t need the “tip”.\n\nIn a pinch Andymark churro stock also works when you run out of regular hex axles, still isn’t rounded enough though.",

The falcon spline allows for smaller gears to be used on the shaft as compared to the 8mm cim key, along with better torque transmission and no washing out or losing of keys.  We love it.\n\nIn some cases, (and I’m guessing here…), the products are meant to be competing products on the market but have intentionally not used an identical feature due to patent/copyright/trademark, etc.  I’m looking at the splines on the kraken, the spline tube shapes from WCP and REV, etc.\n\nIn some cases, the designs were engineering decisions for packaging etc (sparkmax JST connectors).\n\nIn every case, they have a valid reason for existing.\n\nWe can’t design a robot with the same size fasteners everywhere, even though it’d be great if we could keep everything common.  But in some cases, there just isn’t a choice.\n\nshrug .  Engineering.",

Things would be so much easier, but of course, we, unfortunately, don’t live in that society.\n\nEmphasis mine.\n\nThese two statements are vastly contradictory. Do you want things to be easier or do you want students to learn?\n\nWhen working as an industry professional, you may be tasked with using available products that are not in a nice and easy-to-assemble ecosystem. There are very few professions where you get to build your products or solutions out of LEGO.\n\nWhile working at a robotics start up outside of Boston, nearly my entire job was to make non-standard parts coexist with each other. I was trained and prepared for these tasks because of my time in FIRST . Had I only done FLL and never gotten the open ended experience that FTC and FRC taught me, I would have been ill prepared for the ‘real world’. So FIRST served me well in my learning.\n\nPost my time as a student I have made many projects. 3D printers, combat robots, small vehicles, rockets, drones, machine tools, etc. Not a single one of them was I greeted with a standard issued catalog of cohesive parts. Part of my success in those projects was my ability to adapt and react to these non-standard parts.\n\nTFM110:\n\nas my profile says, “Just to clarify, I’m not dumb, I am just learning”\n\nYou are not dumb. You are learning. Just the same as the rest of us. This is a learning opportunity and I do hope that this thread going forward does not bash you. As well, I hope you do not see my post as bashing as I am only trying to aid in the learning of anyone that decides to read this post.\n\nTFM110:\n\nunstandardized which is causing this xkcd meme to keep coming true\n\nDifferent companies and suppliers not being standardized does not make this XKCD comic come true. If we saw REV have 4 different standards then we would see truth inside REV and REV alone. Same as if AM had multiple standards. Or WCP .\n\nYou also have to remember that all FRC suppliers are trying to make building robots easier while simultaneously COMPETING against each other. They are businesses. They need to make money to continue their goal of making more accessible robot parts. They do not make money if you buy other companies components. We live in a capitalist society. Regardless of our feelings on that, it is the truth.\n\nWe, the FRC community as a whole, would collectively suffer if every supplier was 100% compatible and standardized with each other. We would lose many of the great and advantageous products that we are now blessed with because these companies have made enough money to be able to design and sell these products.\n\nWould it be nice if all of FRC was standardized? Sure. Would it be easier? Yes, absolutely. But I will end this rant with a quote.\n\n“Nothing in the world is worth having or worth doing unless it means effort, pain, difficulty… I have never in my life envied a human being who led an easy life. I have envied a great many people who led difficult lives and led them well.” ― Theodore Roosevelt\n\nThis is, afterall, “the hardest fun you’ll ever have.”",

Students should be learning about engineering principles, not wasting weeks debugging vendor migration issues. Migrating from one vendor to another should be as easy as possible. If a vendor can only make money by locking teams into an ecosystem, perhaps they should focus on improving their products instead.\n\nThis kind of change, however, has to be driven by FIRST . Without the threat of making devices illegal, motors and other devices can come with any connector and API vendors choose. FIRST only has the legality lever to pull to control this right now.",

Part of my success in those projects was my ability to adapt and react to these non-standard parts\n\nIf its anything electrical (in America at least)it is standardized under NEMA. You also used a standard of measurements. So trying to say you had to start from scratch with no standard for everything isn’t correct. What op is getting at is standardize some aspects like motor shafts and electrical connectors used but not everything. Low resource teams do not have the funds or equipment to make or have a stockpile of parts on hand for so many different standards.",
