                    "cooked": "A couple of years ago I implemented some gradle tasks to write things like build time and build host and deploy time and deploy host to files on the RoboRio. I had some dependencies that read:\n\nbuild.dependsOn versionTxt tasks.getByName(‘versionTxt’).dependsOn(ensureResources) tasks.getByName(‘deploy’).dependsOn(deployHost) tasks.getByName(‘simulateExternalJava’).dependsOn(deployHost)\n\nThe deployHost task looks like this:\n\ndeployHost() {\n\n}\n\nAnytime I do anything (build, simulate, deploy), I get this at the beginning:\n\nConfigure project: Running versionTxt Running deployHost in c:\\Users\\username\\Documents\\FRCProjects\\RapidReact2022/src/main/deploy\n\nand then the normal output. I don’t see the doFirst and doLast messages unless I actually run the Deploy Robot Code command from the WPI commands. Then I also see:\n\nTask :deployHost Running deployHost doFirst […] Running deployHost doLast […]\n\nI have almost no understanding of how Gradle works. Why do the commands in the deployHost task run in that configure stage, but not the doFirst and doLast blocks, and why do they run in the deploy stage.\n\nOne other thing, the simulateExternalJava taks no longer seems to exist, even though it is still in the docs. I tried changing it to “simulateJava” which does exist. Maybe that isn’t what I need and that is the problem?",

Configuration runs first, and is used to build the task graph, and then execution runs the tasks.\n\nWhen you declare a task in gradle, everything directly inside the block is run during the configuration stage, its not actually getting executed.\n\nEach task has something it executes, that depends on what type of task you declare. That code is ran during execution. doFirst blocks run before that code, and doLast blocks run after that code.\n\nSimulateExternalJava was changed to SimulateExternalJavaDebug and SimulateExternalJavaRelease. This was done to make it easier for editors to switch modes (Although this was not done in VS Code for 2022). So your best option is to make both of those tasks depend on your task (for simulation purposes). The gradle tasks docs page is out of date, and needs to be updated.\n\nAlso, you shouldn’t be making the deploy task depend on something directly. There are many individual deploy tasks, and deploy is just a marker for the end of the deploy graph. You actually want to make the deploy directory deploy task depend on your generation task. You do that with the following code (Which is also linked in the Git code above).\n\ndeploy.targets.roborio.artifacts.frcStaticFileDeploy.dependsOn(deployHost)",

                    "cooked": "Huh. Not saying this isn’t a coincidence, but the code in the documentation is remarkably similar to the code I published in a public repository in Jan. 2020. A couple of other teams picked it up, so even if the code wasn’t mine, I might be the source of the idea. Of course, the main difference is that the code in the docs were written by someone who knew what they were doing, as opposed to mine, which was mostly bludgeoned into existence.\n\nOkay, so I currently have a task with the following structure\n\ntask name() { Code executed at config time doFirst { Code executed when task is run, at the beginning } doLast { Code executed when the task is run, at the end } }\n\nSo how do you designate code to be run after the doFirst code and before the doLast code, i.e. the regular task code?\n\nAlso, I had some files go into the resources directory and some into the deploy directory. I forget why right now, but I think it was because the resources directory gets put into the jar file and I wanted how the files were built to be discoverable even if you only had the jar file. Am I correct, does the resources directory get into the jar file?\n\nI don’t think I want everything to run at config time, since that would mean the deploy task would update when the files are deployed, even if they were built earlier. Is there a way to specify a task to be run after another task has successfully completed?",

But its not worth doing, just treat doLast as your execution block. It will work the exact same way.\n\nblu28:\n\nAm I correct, does the resources directory get into the jar file?\n\nYes, resources directory goes into the jar, so you need to make the generateResources task depend on your task.\n\nblu28:\n\nIs there a way to specify a task to be run after another task has successfully completed?\n\nYou can’t explicitly mark a task to be ran after another task. You can make tasks depend on other tasks, and if you know 2 tasks depend on each other in the graph, you can insert a task between them using dependsOn . One thing to note is that tasks only run if something in the task graph depends on it. Tasks will be skipped if there are no dependencies on the task.\n\nblu28:\n\nOne more thing, I tried the target you gave: “deploy.targets.roborio.artifacts.frcStaticFileDeploy.dependsOn(deployHost)” and it gave me an error:\n\nWhat does your deploy block look like. That code example depends on it looking exactly the same as the standard templates. If anything has been renamed, it won’t work. And that sample must be placed after the deploy block.",
