We know that on the battery side, the 6 AWG wires have to be ~12\" or less.\n\nIs there any documentation as to the recommended or required length that the rest of the 6 AWG wire needs to be between the robot’s Anderson connector and the breaker-to- PDP loop? In our case, we may need a run that is 2 to 3 feet long to connect to our battery’s connector ( plus the 12\" of the battery’s wires).\n\nAlso, would this be a scenario where bumping up to 4 AWG might be beneficial? Looking to follow best practices given where our electrical components have now found themselves after some mechanical adjustments",

                    "cooked": "There is almost no reason to stretch out your 6 wiring.  If you look closely, you will find a way to place your battery and PDP / PDH close together.  As Rich has pointed out above, there is loss in everything, there is no free lunch.  I prefer to think in terms of the “Wire Foot” something that I introduced many years ago.  The reference is 10 wire which is .001 ohms/ft. 6 is roughly half of that.  So in terms of real loss, 2 ft. of #6=1ft. of 10 .  At 100 amps, there is a 0.1 volt loss for every wire foot.  What you propose is adding three feet (6 feet total, both red and black) of 6 wiring to your robot.  Added to the battery cable, that is 8 feet or 0.4 volts per 100 amps.  If you stall four drive motors @100 amps each then your total loss will be in the range of 1.6 volts before that voltage is even distributed in your robot.  Now, if your robot was already running near brownout and you add 1.6 volts of additional loss, you are just that much closer to brownout protect or worse, reboot.  Changing to 4 wire for those runs is about 33% reduction so the change in wire would be only 0.6 volts less loss.  You can gain more if you changed the 6 feet of 6 to 2 feet with a small redesign. The critical factor here is protecting the brownout from occurring.  In most cases I would rather trade placement of components for the additional weight of 6-8 ft. of 4 wire.",
