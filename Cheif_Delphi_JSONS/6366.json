                    "cooked": "Hi all – Just wanted to post that I figured out how to re-use old OM5P-AC routers you might have accumulated over the years instead of letting them become e-waste eventually. They are actually quite nice hardware: dual gigabit ethernet, 2x2 MIMO AC wireless, 30dbm max transmit power (on legal channels, most 24).\n\nI found out the FRC radio configuration utility was using ap51-flash, so I just downloaded a newer copy from here and ran it: Releases · ap51-flash/ap51-flash · GitHub\n\nCan’t post a link but the OpenWRT build I used is openwrt-22.03.3-ath79-generic-openmesh_om5p-ac-v2-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin\n\nUnfortunately, when running it with my network interface, I found out it was expecting a .sig file for signed firmware. This is because apparently they were released with locked down firmware due to previous OM5P-AN routers being able to run outside of legal channels.\n\nFortunately, someone else has already done the research and work into unlocking these (does not enable illegal channels): GitHub - true-systems/om5p-ac-v2-unlocker: Open Mesh OM5P-AC v2 Unlocker (U-Boot 1.1.4 based)\n\nAll you need to do is start a tftp server and serve up those 2 files, then it will magically not require a signature file anymore.\n\nI’ve made a small screencast of the process on an unmodified router. Once you do this there is NO GOING BACK. THIS IS ALSO NOT LEGAL FOR COMPETITION USE IN THE SLIGHTEST & WONT WORK AT ALL WITH DRIVER STATION OUTSIDE OF COMP EITHER.\n\nFrom here, it’s basically just connecting to it on 192.168.1.1 (will have to play with ethernet stuff) and then you’re free to do whatever with it\n\nMight just be having a dumb moment or maybe wrong ethernet port on router but I couldn’t get 192.168.1.1 to work so I ended up using the debug console (ftdi attached to internal uart) to edit /etc/config/network and set the ethernet protocol to dhcp instead’ve static and sharing the wifi over ethernet port on my PC using windows internet connection sharing.",

Is it possible that you’re using 5v logic instead of 3.3v maybe? Could it get cooked from something like that? I wouldn’t think so… but\n\nCould it be the keymap or the COM port terminal program you’re using? What did you do to figure out it was pulling to 3.3v?\n\nIf you’re able to get into u-boot menu at all by mashing spacebar that tells me it could be a firmware issue and maybe needs re-flashed?",
