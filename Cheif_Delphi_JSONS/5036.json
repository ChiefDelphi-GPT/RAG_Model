That camera is detected within several seconds and the output stream is rock solid for the more than 3 hours I’ve been running it. Previous 2024 version took a long time to acquire that camera and sometimes never did and the output stream often disconnected and wouldn’t reconnect. [Note that the camera setting in config.txt has moved from /boot to /boot/firmware and the docs need updating.]",

                    "cooked": "@thatmattguy I am looking for a better localization solution to use this year (just like everyone else I know) and have tried a lot of different solutions. I have gone from photonvision with photonlib to photonvision with a custom SLAM pipeline, to a custom version of northstar with the SLAM backend, to our northstar version with the wpilib SwerveDrivePoseEstimator. Needless to say I am not happy with any of the options I’ve tried so far. My vision goals for this season are:\n\nAccurate vision across the entire field.\n\nGood outlier rejection\n\nAware of pose ambiguity\n\nBe easy enough for someone that isn’t me to fix small problems at home (ie don’t need to have experience in software, deployment, and controls to understand the setup)\n\nCurrently I’m thinking about using our northstar implementation with your gtsam-playground code. It meets all my criteria other than 4. Deploying anything to a coprocessor will always be a pain and northstar is not easy to configure (We use docker compose).\n\nMy question for you is, why should I switch from northstar to photonvision? I like the simplicity of the code behind northstar, I like being in complete control of the code,I like being able to spin up multiple completely isolated instances on the robot, I like being able to tune the expose and brightness in robot code, I like being in full control over the camera tuning and uploading the tune separately to the config. The only think I dont like about northstar is docker compose being a pain to mess with at competitions which is where photonvision comes in.\n\nCan I run two instances of photonvision at the same time (on two coprocessors)?",

I rechecked the 2025 beta docs and they still show that JDK 11 is the only supported version.  I installed JDK 17 and successfully ran the .jar.  Everything seems to be working correctly in the GUI.\n\nI’m assuming that the docs have not been updated to show the 2025 beta dependency on JDK 17.  However, if I’m supposed to be able to run the .jar using JDK 11, maybe someone could help me with what I’m missing.",

Yesterday, however, we ran into a strange issue. We saw an error in the Driver Station console that PhotonVision wasn’t connected to the time sync server and that the latest result was around 9e12 seconds ago. What was strange was that all the detected poses were still correctly sent to the RoboRio and were being processed correctly. In the timesync tab of the networktables I saw that the ping counter of photonvision kept increasing, but all other values, including pong count were at zero. Also each time at robot startup the following text appeared in the Driver Station console: TimeSyncServer: use after free? . Both our PhotonVision vendordep and OrangePI 5 firmware version were at beta-2, and upgrading them to beta-5 seems to have solved the issue, but I don’t know if it could occur again. We also probably have to switch back to beta-4, since we are currently running wpilib beta-1. Could the issue have been fixed after beta-2 or is there something else wrong?",

Maybe my search queries were incorrect or I didn’t look well enough, but I did not get any results from PhotonVision, WPILib or any other FRC source.\n\nthatmattguy:\n\nThis is also a class of bug that should have been caught by automated testing on a roborio+coprocessor test bench if we had that set up.\n\nNow that I think about it, we did test the setup once and it seemed to run correctly, but then a week later we started noticing the time sync errors. Also power cycling did not solve the issue, so maybe the error can occur after some time and then persist. That would also explain why the test setup did not catch the bug. Or we could have missed the errors the first time we tested, that is also a reasonable explanation.",
