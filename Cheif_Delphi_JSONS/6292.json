Best practice IMO is writing the code yourself, and even a more readable approach.\n\nFor adjusting params, you can find all the feedforward gains (kS, kV, kG and kA) using SysID, and add a bit of a kP to the controller for feedback control.

This is risky, and not really how you should operate with command-based. The better approach IMO is calling controller.reset and controller.setGoal in the onInit of a FunctionalCommand , call a function to apply all the gains and follow the profile in the command’s onExecute , and stop the motor onEnd . You can also add an isFinished for when you reach the target, but keep in mind that your arm might fall when you reach the target and the motor stops applying kG .",

                    "cooked": "Your pidController.setReference in periodic is not correct.  The first argument should be the desired position.  The feedforward voltage is passed in a separate argument as shown in the documentation .\n\nThe feedforward output should be dominant.  If your feedforward model is excellent, the PID feedback should do almost nothing, with the output staying near zero volts at all times.\n\nThe way your code is written, you are technically using the feedforward model as feedback linearization for the effect of gravity on the arm since you are passing currentAngleRadians as the position argument.  To use it as true feedforward, you would need to pass the position setpoint.  What you are doing is probably best since you don’t have a trapezoidal profile for your arm setpoint.  If you pass a position setpoint to the feedforward calculation that is only reachable in the future because the arm motor can’t spin infinitely quickly, you may do more harm than good.  However, if you pass position and velocity targets computed from a trapeziodal velocity profile which is achievable, feedforward will work best.  You may want to look at this CD thread for additional comments.\n\nLastly, you may want to start your journey toward getting good feedforward model parameters by using the reca.lc arm calculator .  By putting in decent estimates of your arm center of mass distance from the pivot and the the arm mass, you will be in the ballpark with the computed FF parameters at the bottom of the page.  You can still attempt sysID on the arm if you want, but you need to be careful and make sure you have SparkMAX features to stop moving the arm before it hits physical stops (e.g. soft rotation limits or hard limits based on sensors).  I personally prefer to start with the estimates from reca.lc and then tune those by moving the arm under combined FF + FB control and adjusting the FF model parameters (usually not by much) until the FB output stays reasonably close to zero when the arm is parallel to the ground (kG), and then when moving to other positions (kV).",

This is to avoid a case where your arm is 180deg off and feeding forward in the wrong direction into a hardstop.\n\nTo OP: start with manually finding kG such that the arm stays still when you don’t apply any other output. Then do sysID on top of that or roughly calculate kV and kA based on your motor and gear ratio (recalc does this for you!). Then add some P control. You can also do P before kV and kA. And honestly, kA is probably wholly unnecessary for an arm.\n\nThere is no need at all to write your own profiled PID controller from scratch. Nothing wrong with starting simple here with the library.",

You may be confusing a SparkMAX controller with a WPILIb PIDController .  Does VSCode complain about these calls?\n\nYou also need something that initializes the controller and your encoder when you enable the robot.  I’m assuming that when you enable, the arm is not perfectly parallel to the floor such that the current arm angle is 0.0 and your motor encoder should be returning 0.0.\n\nWith an arm, I typically keep it under closed-loop control at all times.  No matter what you are doing, whether in teleop or auto, you typically want the arm to be under control in a specific position.  If you put the controller in open-loop and stop the motor (e.g. voltage = 0), the arm is going to fall down, dramatically if you’ve got the motor set to coast.  Assuming that your NormalCommand is implementing FunctionalCommand behind the scenes and if there was a way to detect that the arm angle controller had reached setpoint to end the command, your command would stop control and let the arm fall.",

                    "cooked": "You are correct about the dictionary definition of feedforward and feedback. However, I think that the point of kG is to linearize the system and simplify controls. You could apply kG by using the current commanded trajectory point, but it’s safer to just apply kG for the position you are at. That way, if kG is larger than your other control efforts, you won’t end up in a situation where kG is fighting your controller. The motion system is linearized by using kG; your arm should act like a linear PID controller after kG is applied IMO. It’s very easy to tune kG, then add a little kP, and end up with a good arm controller. That’s not necessarily the case if you use a kG based on target position.\n\nPlus, applying kG at your current angle means you can implement manual overrides trivially.",

The controller needs to continue to send the necessary voltage to the arm motors to hold the arm in place.  Assuming that you have sufficient gear reduction between the motors and arm, this will be a reasonably small voltage and holding the motor shafts stationary with this voltage will not burn up the motors.\n\nYou need to have some way to send new setpoints to the arm.  If you are doing the control calculations in a command rather than something in periodic, one way is to make sure the arm subsystem is specified as a requirement for the command.  That way, if you send a new arm angle command, the scheduler will cancel the old one and run the new one with the new setpoint.  You could also write your command so it gets the setpoint from a double supplier allowing it to get new setpoints whenever they change in the supplier.  With this approach, you would not need to send new commands.",
