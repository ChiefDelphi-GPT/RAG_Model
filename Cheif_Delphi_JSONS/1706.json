                    "cooked": "A new era in robot vision\n\nHey y’all! You may have seen (somewhat) recent comments and threads about exploring the use of a Luxonis OAK-D stereo camera for VIO (Visual Inertial Odometry) in FRC , as a potential alternative here, with the help of @dragonblade316 .\n\nTo summarize what happened on that project, we couldn’t come to a licensing agreement with SpectacularAI (who made the Spectacular VIO algorithm) that would be suitable for a FRC environment. While we could have continued with that as an x86 only solution, we felt that ideally we would be able to use ARM based coprocessors as well, as they can be more efficient, more compact, and cheaper.\n\nSince that project, Luxonis (the manufacturer of OAK-D cameras), has released an updated version of their API, known as DepthAI v3, which now includes several features that would be incredibly useful in a FRC context. These features include:\n\nVIO/ VSLAM\n\nObject tracking\n\n2D AprilTag tracking\n\nGiven this feature set, we felt that the OAK-D remains a potential viable alternative to existing solutions in FRC , and is worth pursuing. Best of all, running this requires very minimal setup. All you need is a Linux host, clone the Python code, install the requirements in a virtual environment, and run it. That’s it, no more complicated setup.\n\nAn additional benefit to this is the size of the overall solution. For example, an OAK-D Lite measures only 91x28x17.5 mm. And ideally we imagine pairing it with a very small coprocessor, such as the Radxa Zero 3E . This results in a solution that is cheap, compact, and extremely quick and easy to get running. This solution should be able to be powered by a power bank or a USB-C power supply, such as the Redux Zinc-V, further simplifying the overall solution for teams. This particular combination of hardware should result in a very small, LimeLight-esque package, streamlining integration on the robot, with only a USB-C cable for power, and Ethernet for networking needing to be plugged into the overall package.\n\nRight now, the project is hosted here: https://github.com/lasarobotics/PurpleRanger To play with it on your own machine if you have an OAK-D camera, run ./main.py --help to see the various options.\n\nAt the current time, VIO is an alpha feature in DepthAI v3, and we’ve noticed significant drift in the pose estimate. However, this is a bug, and we are working with the Luxonis developers to resolve this.\n\nHere are some images, to provide a preview of what PurpleRanger is capable of now:\n\nAn example of VIO (exhibits the drift issue at the time of writing). The pose estimate is published over NetworkTables. The published table is very minimal.\n\nAn example of object tracking. The algorithm also provides coordinates of where the object is in space relative to the camera, using stereo vision to locate the object that was identified via the inference model. We believe this could prove very useful in tracking game objects, and driving towards them. This example is running yolov6-nano, on the camera’s built-in accelerator.\n\nAn example of the 2D AprilTag tracking pipeline. We hope to use this as an example to help us integrate AprilTag pose estimation into VIO.\n\nFor all three functions, a camera stream from the device is published at localhost:8080, as shown in the screenshots.\n\nRegarding the future, we hope to have VIO working without drift soon, and work on integrating 3D AprilTag pose estimation into VIO, eliminating the need for external devices for pose initialization. We could potentially even run AprilTag pose estimation using both left and right stereo cameras, and merge those pose estimates, to provide more accurate AprilTag pose data to the overall algorithm.",

Hopefully it gets merged in soon.\n\nHere’s a 5 minute test of the device sitting motionless to see how much it drifts:\n\nAs you can see, it drifts very minimally over the course of 5 minutes. This is encouraging to see for future testing.\n\nWe’ll start work on merging AprilTag pose estimation, now that VIO doesn’t appear to drift anymore, and look into various sensor fusion techniques.\n\nI’m also starting work on writing shell scripts and systemd service files to install PurpleRanger on various Linux distros easily, and automatically run it as a user level systemd service on boot. I hope to make using PurpleRanger as painless as possible.\n\nAnyone who has ideas on sensor fusion strategies, feel free to chime in, we’d welcome the advice.",

We have been continuing to work on this behind the scenes and have made some good progress.\n\nWe have decided for now to use RTABMap as our method for sensor fusion and SLAM. The main reason for this is convenience. Depthai (the library that powers our cameras) contains a wrapper for RTABMap that makes it rather easy for us to use.\n\nRTABMap also supports various inputs allowing us to pass in both vio and apriltag detection and it will handle the fusion for us using its internal factor graph.\n\nUnfortunately, Depthai does not at this moment have good support for using apriltags with rtabmap, so we have been working on adding the functionality.\n\nThe apriltag support is now compiling and not immediately crashing so hopefully we will be able to get this tested and merged into depthai-core soon.\n\nOverall, things are looking good for this project at the moment, hopefully we can start accuracy and performance testing in the near future.\n\nEdit: Did not mean for this to be a reply.

We also plan on various improvements in the future, such as providing the RTABMap algorithm a different covariance reading (similar to std dev) for every marker transform, using the IMU’s detected gravity vector to intelligently reject tags that appear to be in an incorrect orientation, and using stereo depth to help validate the solved AprilTag pose.\n\nNote in the above test, only tag 10 is available to the camera.\n\nRight now we’re working on fine tuning, and getting this running on various SBCs (Radxa Zero 3E, and Raspberry Pi 5).\n\nIf anyone would like to try this out, here’s a the depthai x86 Python wheel package you need to use, as it includes our changes: depthai-3.0.0rc3.dev0+98e2e7a89ad3927fdfd15d55249dde3c525dba7b-cp313-cp313-linux_x86_64.zip (39.8 MB)\n\nEDIT: Please use the “slam-landmarks” branch of PurpleRanger, as that is where we are actively developing.",

The pose estimate jumped often when moving around and going in and out of tag visibility. This pipeline remains in the code, in the hopes that it might become useful in the future, and our work adding the necessary functionality upstream into DepthAI v3 will be useful to many others.\n\nGiven the aforementioned observations, we decided to change our approach. We have implemented a particle filter, which uses the Basalt VIO algorithm and AprilTag pose estimates as inputs. Using this approach, the pose estimate output stream is much more stable, and accurate. I haven’t made measurements to quantify its accuracy, but it is a significant improvement from before.\n\nIn this test, I tried to move the camera in a very jerky way, to simulate the high accelerations of a robot moving and spinning around. As shown, it doesn’t appear to jump very much even when the camera is pointed back at the tag (again only tag 10 is available to the camera), which would seem to suggest that Basalt VIO is doing a pretty good job of keeping track of the device’s position even when tags are not available.\n\nFurther, the above test was executing on a Radxa Rock 5A as the SBC. It performs quite well, even with 2000 particles in the particle filter. Unfortunately this means that the Zero 3E that I originally wanted to use isn’t quite powerful enough to run this project in realtime. But, SBCs like the Rock 5A, and the Pi 5 are. This gives me great hope for PurpleRanger to run directly on SystemCore in future seasons, with no coprocessor necessary.\n\nFinally, for those interested, here are some Python wheel packages for ARM and x86 to try out.\n\nTighten IMU covariance Depthai Python CI/CD #24\n\nTighten IMU covariance Depthai Python CI/CD #24\n\nDepthai Python CI/CD #24\n\nI am very hopeful to have this running on our robot at DRIP (our next off-season event), and gather more data.\n\nP.S. It appears that Basalt, the VIO algorithm that we are using, is used in another open-source project, Monado XR , a cross-platform XR runtime. Here is a link to a talk done regarding VIO by a Monado developer.",
