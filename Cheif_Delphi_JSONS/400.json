Below is the processed content:\n\n---\n\nThe text begins with the creation of a <strong>COTS</strong>-compatible belt in-take system designed for a <strong>two-stage elevator</strong>. <strong>It was initially conceived</strong> to address the issue of requiring a manual continual elevator with no tube, focusing instead on manufacturing a <strong>continuous belt</strong>.\n\nInitially, the team considered a complex two-slip block system, which involved intricate manufacturing due to the necessity of creating a <strong>continuous belt</strong> connecting two <strong>3/16\" plates</strong>. However, after exploring various options, the team decided on a more straightforward approach involving large <strong>bearings</strong> stacked end-to-end, which simplified the process significantly. This led to the development of a <strong>thin-belt</strong> example, which proved successful after testing.\n\nDuring development, the focus was on ensuring that the <strong>cables</strong> were appropriately manufactured, with a strong emphasis on the <strong>dimmensional consistency</strong> of the components. The team utilized <strong>3D modeling</strong> tools like <strong>LightWave</strong> for visualization and planning, and <strong>AutoCAD</strong> for drafting purposes.\n\nThe key constraint was that teams had to build a <strong>continuous elevator</strong> using no tubes and minimal machinery, which required ingenuity. As the project progressed, the team realized the importance of maintaining a high level of mechanical integrity despite the lack of traditional pulley systems.\n\nIn the second iteration, the team improved upon their initial designs by introducing a <strong>varying pulley size</strong> and <strong>stage spacing</strong>. They created <strong>wider</strong> examples using larger pulleys and different belt sizes, optimizing the setup for both efficiency and durability. One significant advancement was implementing a <strong>positive</strong> <strong>offset</strong> for pulleys, ensuring robust alignment regardless of the belt type.\n\nThroughout the development process, the team faced challenges such as drilling precision for pulleys and managing the construction timeline effectively. Despite these hurdles, they successfully completed the project, showcasing the versatility of COTS-compatible systems in modern elevator technology.\n\nThe final product demonstrates how intricate elevator designs can be achieved through meticulous planning and iterative improvements. The team emphasizes the importance of adhering to specifications while pushing boundaries in creativity and functionality. Overall, the text highlights the journey from initial concept to a refined, reliable elevator solution that balances simplicity with advanced engineering principles.",

                    "cooked": "Planning an elevator project involves several key components. First, consider the tube plates, which have approximate internal dimensions of 0.06 inches according to REV; slightly oversized tubes may require filing the plates down. Next, tapping requires 48 holes and is time-consuming; alternative options like FabWorks exist but come with added costs. The idler shaft should be either 8mm or 5/16 inches in diameter and cut to 2 inches. For elevator blocks, REV is recommended unless you opt for West Coast Products, which is currently unavailable and expected to restock by January's end. Additionally, use the specified bottom belt holder for belt retention if your elevator isn't the exact width. Lastly, share any issues encountered during construction to help others avoid potential pitfalls.",
