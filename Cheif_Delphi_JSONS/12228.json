                    "cooked": "Hi! We were trying to get our old bot code and firmware working with the 2023 updates. We were working on our flat bot that only has a drivetrain and no mechanisms. I updated the firmware on our Talon SRXs as well as the image on our Roborio. I imported the java file that I used from last year into 2023 WPILIB. After deploying the code to the robot, I try to fire the motors and nothing happens. There are no errors in Driver Station. We checked all of the status lights on our speed controllers, the Roborio, our PDP, and our radio. I also tried to make our robot run without going through the controller, but there was no response from the motors. We checked all CAN connections as well as the power connections. I attached the link for our Git Hub. We are having issues with the “FlatBotCode” files. The files in the Git Hub are the files that we make changes to. I’ve never run into this issue before, especially without the presence of any errors or status lights. If anyone has some time, could you give the code a look and give us some pointers on other things to check out that might have not crossed our minds?\n\nThank you so much for your time and help!\n\nLansingRobotics has 3 repositories available.

In both of those cases, you should end up with motors that successfully drive with Phoenix Tuner.\n\nTo make it easier on yourself, in VS Code generate a TimedRobot Template project and deploy it.  That will make sure that there isn’t any robot code that could conflict with what you’re trying to do.  Go through the CTRE bring documentation, step by step.  Then see where to go with code from there.\n\nAs an alternative, your flat bot code very much is doing things “the old way”.  I would recommend just starting from a new command template, or just moving your flatbot code into a TimedRobot and just do all the decision making in teleopPeriodic.  Would be much cleaner that way.",

I would also say again, what do the status LEDs tell you is happening?  You earlier said that you don’t have status LEDs, which suggests you don’t have power.\n\nAlternatively, it could mean that someone plugged the Talon SRX with power and ground swapped (has happened on my team before) and you burnt up the SRX.  So even though you think they are plugged in correctly, they are dead.  If you have CAN IDs showing up in Phoenix Tuner, then you should have status LEDs.",
