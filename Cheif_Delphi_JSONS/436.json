The robot is very fast, as we used the L3 gear ratio, but sometimes it isn’t as responsive as I would like it to be. The main reasons for this I believe is how long it takes to accelerate, and the fact that we are using normal Xbox controllers for both drivers. Both of these factors in conjunction still produce a drive-able robot, but I think there is still room for improvement. (I think the robot also being max weight doesn’t help the issue.) If there is anything to try programming wise, please let me know. Or, if your team is using a different control scheme, that would be useful as well : )",

                    "cooked": "I don’t see why using an Xbox controller would reduce responsiveness; the major factor that affects the ability of your robot to quickly change speed is going to be your gearing. For a game like Reefscape, where we don’t need full field cycles, a gearing closer to L1 is more advantageous. More torque and acceleration is exactly what you need for short back-and-forth cycles and high responsiveness.\n\nBut software does play an important role, too. Firstly, if your PID gains for the drive motors are a little too small, you could see that the robot takes too long to respond to reach a new velocity reference. To tune these values, I like to open Phoenix Tuner X and watch the velocity and reference for the drive motors. If you can increase kP without seeing oscillation, your system will probably drive a little faster. It’s also possible that you’re hitting your current limit on the drivetrain when accelerating so you’re limited that way. I’m not saying to double the current limit or anything, but watch battery draw during a match and see if you have a little extra current to spare.",

(But I’m very biased as I spent 14 years working in Microsoft’s game group)\n\nThere are a few things your software team should look at.\n\nfirst are you using the CTRE generated swerve code? Have you tried driving the robot on a fresh install of that code?\n\nhave you tried changing the acceleration values in the constants file?\n\nYou said your configured for L3, does the code reflect that?\n\nrun a profiler and look for particularly long intervals\n\nAll that said responsiveness typically isn’t a function of acceleration but a function of latency. The robot isn’t as fast as your commands. Now you can’t delete latency as it takes time for signals to travel and physical motors to spin up….but we have the same configuration you do and our robot is spry.\n\nHence my first recommendation. Run the robot with just CTRE ’s swerve code and see how that feels. If it’s snappy then you know you’ve got an issue somewhere in your control system code.",

L3 gives you a higher max speed, which means that you can go faster once you get to your maximum speed, but you also have a lower acceleration, which means that it takes you longer to get to that maximum speed, and your robot may seem less responsive because it takes longer to speed up. Choosing your gear ratio is a game of “how long am I spending at max speed” (and also current draw); if you spend a lot of time at your max speed it may be worth it to go to a higher gear ratio, but if you spend little or no time at your max speed, you might want to go to a lower gear ratio. It’s worth noting that this is true not just for drivetrains but for any mechanism, whether it’s an arm or an elevator or a turret or a flywheel. Would you be able to upload logs of your robot showing how fast you’re moving, current, voltage, etc?",

This gave us incredible pushing power, but also incredible agility and reactivity.\n\nWe regularly replaced the tread (new set per comp) so we had constant traction.\n\nFinally, we had a very low center of gravity which helps absorb hits well, but also accelerate quickly with fast changes in direction.\n\nTuning tuning tuning. I spent a good couple days tuning the PID controllers on the swerve and finding at comps the max current limits I could implement without our robot browning out.\n\nAdded a non linear transformation on the inputs of our Xbox controller, which helps more with control. Although, I also thought the robot just felt better.\n\nWhile our team uses this for play lights out defense, these tips will also help on the offensive side of play to get around defense.",

There’s a difference between stator current (the current at the motor) and the supply current (the current the motor controller receives).
