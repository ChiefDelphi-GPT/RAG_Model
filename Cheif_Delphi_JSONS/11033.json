                    "cooked": "There would be a lot of friction passing the cord through those motor mounts like that - we’ll get to that later.  With two 5:1 and one 3:1 stage, followed by a 30:45 stage, you have a 112.5:1 overall reduction on a motor with a free speed of 6000 RPM and a stall torque of .105 N*m.\n\nThe free speed tells you the maximum speed the motor can run when there’s no load on it.  6000 RPM /112.5 = 53.3RPM.  That is already fairly slow - if you have a 1\" diameter spool on your winch, then that means it pulls in about 2.8\" per second.  To raise something 1 foot would take over 4 seconds, at the motor free speed.  Since you’re actually lifting something, your motor will be running slower than free speed, so I would guess closer to 6 seconds to lift 1 foot.  Note if your spool is smaller, then it would be even slower, while a larger spool would go faster!\n\nThat brings us to the output torque.  For a mechanism like this, I would look at what I need to lift and work backwards - so long as you have enough torque, it’ll lift, so you can then adjust your gear ratio knowing that limit.  If the total amount I need to lift (game piece + mechanism) was 10 lbs, then I can use that to figure my ideal gear ratio.  I need to know what I’m using for a spool, to start.  Lets use that same 1\" spool from the paragraph above.  That means my output stall torque on the motor needs to be at least 1\" * 10 lbs = 10 in lbs.  For convenience, we’ll convert the motor’s .105 N m to .92989 in lbs, or about 1 in lbs.  That would mean I need a total gear ratio of somewhere around 10:1 in order to barely be able to lift it.  I like to build in a safety factor, meaning I have at least 50% more torque than I need, so I would aim for something like 15:1 or 20:1 in this case - both of which would go significantly faster than the 112.5:1 you have currently!  Of course, the weight you’re lifting (for example, mechanism + game piece) really matters when figuring this out!\n\nNow, if we build it that way and it doesn’t work, we need to figure out why.  Either something was off in our calculations, our weight measurements were wrong, or we didn’t take something into account - in this case, it would likely be friction from those motor mounts - you’d need to increase the gear ratio in order to overcome both the weight and the friction in the system.\n\nNow, with the background out of the way, to get to your question:\n\nNenu:\n\nIs it ok to lift directly from the winch as I’m afraid I make damages .\n\nThat depends.  Many teams have lifted 150 lb FRC robots straight from the winch without problems.  But to do that, you need to have the winch properly supported. AndyMark’s Climber in a Box Winch Kits can provide some great inspiration.  With these kits, the winch shaft is fully supported on both sides, with the whole thing having a small width.  It avoids having a cantilevered shaft, which can easily bend, or a very long shaft, which could also bend even if supported on both sides.  Support your winch shaft the same way, and it’ll likely be ok.  By supporting, I mean having some bearings on either side so your motor doesn’t take any side load.\n\nSo, take a look at how the winch is mounted, strengthen that if needed.  Remove the extra friction and consider if you can decrease the gear ratio, and you can get that speed up!",

The winch drum diameter is around 3/4 of an inch. I would like to lift the robot which it weights approximately 22 pounds and would like to do it in 10 second in a height of 171 cm. The only gear ratios I got are from Rev robotics which are 5:1,4:1 and the 3:1.\n\nThe  other problem I faced when I did 5:1, 4:1 and the 3:1 gear ratios the motor starts going backwards when it reached the desired height . Sorry for this but I’m not that much technical in these things.",

Thus your current 112.5:1 is about 3x too high to meet your speed target, in a perfect world.\n\nNow, lets look at torque:\n\n22lbs * 3/4 in = 16.5 in*lbs\n\n16.5 in lbs / 1 in lbs = 16.5:1\n\nyou need a 16.5:1 ratio or larger to meet your torque needs.\n\nSo, your sweet spot for an overall gear ratio is somewhere between 16.5:1 and 35:1.  Keep in mind that you don’t want to be running the motor too close to stall torque (16.5:1), and you won’t hit your free speed number because you have a load on the motor (35:1).\n\nIf it were me, I would aim for a total reduction of 25:1 - 30:1.  Try going with a 5:1, 4:1, and the 45:30 - that’ll give you a total of 30:1.  If you want to try faster, you could replace the 4:1 with a 3:1, that would give you a 22.5:1 - perhaps a little too close to stall for me, but you won’t know until you test it!",

Now I’m trying to experiment by making  a winch by itself and I’m trying two motors spinning the same shaft as I’m attaching the picture below. I put two 4:1 ratios on the motors and 1 45 tooth gear in the middle and a 30 tooth gear on the motors but still I cannot lift the 22lbs.\n\nIMG-20221027-WA0001 2048×1152 288 KB IMG-20221026-WA0007 1536×2048 359 KB\n\nIMG-20221027-WA0001 2048×1152 288 KB\n\nIMG-20221027-WA0001 2048×1152 288 KB\n\nIMG-20221026-WA0007 1536×2048 359 KB\n\nIMG-20221026-WA0007 1536×2048 359 KB",

I tried to calculate the ratios   on what I did and guess I bring them somewhere near 51:1 , is it better to calculate in inches or mm ? Sorry for asking much as I’m just trying to learn . If I put two 5:1 ratios on both motor and I leave the 30 tooth gear and the 45 tooth gear I end up with a 37:1 ratio if I’m making the sum well. Thanks",

If we assume friction doesn’t exist (it does, but that’s fine), then your spool size has the opposite impact as your gear ratio.  A larger gear ratio means more torque and less speed, while a larger spool means more speed and less torque.  The ratio between torque and speed is basically inversely linear, no matter what you do - to get more of one, you get less of the other.\n\nSo while your larger spool did give you more speed, it reduced the torque to the point where it couldn’t lift it.\n\nNenu:\n\nIt have a diameter of 8.04 inch.\n\nKeep in mind none of my math used 8” for the spool diameter, so you’ll need to figure that out.\n\nYour basic equations are:\n\nimage 992×692 91.8 KB\n\nimage 992×692 91.8 KB\n\nimage 992×692 91.8 KB\n\nThe two red equations could be written as a single equation easily enough, but breaking it out this way helps show what each part of the equation is actually doing.  Ditto for the blue!\n\nThe motor specs we have are 6000 RPM and 1 in * lbs of torque - those are the starting points for the red and blue equations (for a single motor… if you have two motors, then you double the torque while the speed remains constant)!\n\nYour requirements are 22 lbs, 10 seconds, and 67 inches of travel - those are the lifting force and speed, or the ending points for your equations.\n\nIn the middle you have your gear ratio and your spool dimensions.  You can’t solve for one without knowing the other.  Sometimes, you have a spool in mind, so you plug in the numbers from your spool to figure out your ratio.  Other times, you may have limited ratios available, so you plug those in to see what spool sizes you can use.\n\nTry playing with those equations a little, along with your available gear ratios and spools, and see what you can learn!",
