I’ve learned a lot from resources from 1678 and 2910, and been able to witness the extraordinary growth and effort from my own team for the past few years, and I’ve been trying to compose good ways to help spread that to teams that may be in the same position we used to be in.\n\nI’ve seen a lot of resources about these topics in depth but it can kind of be overwhelming, so I’ve created a short guide encompassing everything I think teams down on their luck and knowledge should focus on in order to improve their performance.\n\nThis list disregards further program-building and fundraising and sustainability, but they do go hand in hand usually. The more competitive your team is, the more enthusiasm you’ll be able to build, the more people you’ll be able to recruit and train, etc. But I think that’s a separate topic that could go much deeper than what I want to do today.\n\nCreate and follow a schedule to prioritize drive practice, testing, and programming time. This is incredibly important and was one of 1778’s first steps towards improving performance. You get a lot of gain from just reprioritizing.\n\nCreate and follow a schedule to prioritize drive practice, testing, and programming time.

You get a lot of gain from just reprioritizing.\n\nDecide to build a strategic robot you know your team can complete with enough time for drive practice and programming before your first event. This often means making tradeoffs and deciding which functionality is most important.\n\nDecide to build a strategic robot you know your team can complete with enough time for drive practice and programming before your first event. This often means making tradeoffs and deciding which functionality is most important.\n\nPrioritize consistency and reliability. This guides a lot of the other points, but specifically, ensure good electrical and mechanical reliability by testing and running the robot as hard as you can before your competition, with time to fix/improve upon any issues. Also test the robot functionality and check any previously known issues between every single match. Don’t leave anything to chance. If it’s “good enough” it probably isn’t good enough.\n\nPrioritize consistency and reliability.

If it’s “good enough” it probably isn’t good enough.\n\nLearn and practice robot design and strategic design in the offseason - copy and learn from the best!! Most mechanisms have already been done in one form or another; don’t reinvent the ball shooter or elevator, at least not in the middle of a competition season. Designing a robot should mostly be about prototyping and integration. Many of 1778’s robots are a combination of different subsystems from various other teams and ones the students have experience designing and executing.\n\nLearn and practice robot design and strategic design in the offseason - copy and learn from the best!!

Everyone should remain on the same page.\n\nSet a good standard of communication and leadership with your team so everyone knows what the plans are and who is doing what. Everyone should remain on the same page.\n\nNow, it’s one thing to know all this, but it’s another thing to execute it. It’s hard. It’s hard to not overestimate yourself and to commit to a safe design you know you can execute well. It’s hard work to practice and learn good design and electrical practices. It’s hard to stick to a schedule.\n\nThis whole thing only works when the team as a whole can define attainable goals for a season and commit to reaching them. It only works if you can keep everyone on the same page throughout the season and at competition. The most crucial step of the process is realizing you can’t do it alone; FRC is done in teams for a reason, so your team has to be able to know its goals and work towards them together.\n\nP.S. There’s a lot of things a team can do to chase 1% gains; try to avoid that when you’re just trying to be a good team at first. Try to use your time and resources efficiently. Get the most gains for the least amount of effort continuously (by following my list above) and you’ll be Worlds Division Playoffs level before you need to focus on the 1% gains.",

Finally, we are ready to play in week 6 of comps. Luckily, we do and will bring a ready to play the game at an elevated level.\n\nWith CA going to districts next year we cannot afford to have a practice first event because of the points, four weeks will be the hard stop not 12 long build weeks like this season.  Week 1 was our first three day  practice although we were  good enough  to be Alliance 7’s 2nd pick, Week 4  we climbed in Day 2 to Alliance 8 Captainand bested Alliance 4 made it to Match 10 (Day 1 still practice/Day 2 solid) , Week 6 (Ready  to play the game from Day 1 into Day 2 ) our last chance for CMPTX . Lets go!\n\nIn 2023 we redid (chopped in half and strategy entirely into a crowd pleaser) our entry in two weeks between regionals and went from not picked rank 54 in event 1 to Captain of 7th Alliance.  Because re-did bot could do the thing FAST. The first 7-week build was over complex and slow. We learned the finish early lesson that year.\n\nThen 4 week build in 2024 and voila 2024… First Finals as pick 2 of Alliance 6\n\nSo why 12 weeks in 2025?  We used to be bad at any Pick and Place game and had to get over that. So, we took the time to get good at \"Pick and Place’ games that’s why. This is the most difficult “Pick and place game” yet. Yikes. And we have DEEP working surprisingly good should be totally solid by next week. So should multi L4 auto\n\nAt least with Swerve we did that over the 2022 offseason, so we had it for 2023, that is the way to go. Game play is harder to accurately do in offseason, so it does require some extra time during the season to get it figured out. Now we know how to play all the games.",

We chose to do an elevator bot (on a kit chassis because we don’t have enough swerve modules yet for two chassis) in the 2024 offseason because we predicted it would be an elevator game this year and we hadn’t designed and made a good elevator ever. We did so in offseason, took a long time, made a couple mistakes, and so for this season we were prepared. The only “new” thing on our robot this year is the arm pivot, which our designers looked at robots like 2910 2023 for inspiration for. After learning how to execute a pivot well, that opens up a lot of mechanism design for your robot because you can extrapolate the principles. Spread the load with chain, low backlash, high rigidity, transfer torque directly into the arm, etc.\n\nIg the point of all that is that at the start, you may need to be more strict about what kind of mechanisms you’re comfortable with executing, but as you gain more experience, the principles can be extrapolated and you can innovate a bit more in build season. If you’re limited to in season stuff, go simpler with mechanisms you have no experience with. There are quite a few good cascade elevator designs out there that can be adapted easily for robots this year.",
