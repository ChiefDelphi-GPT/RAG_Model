I think you can fix it by just removing all the thread wrappers around everything.\n\nI can guarantee that you did the multithreading wrong.  By using multithreading in a robot program at all.  You don’t need multithreading to set motors, honestly I can’t think of a use case in FRC beyond doing heavy file operations.  Multithreading is a dangerous tool, where it’s easy to start trying to pour hot water before you even consider taking a mug out of the cupboard for your tea.\n\nI would suggest taking a look at the WPILib docs and their examples for how to structure a subsystem like this without threading, since any required asynchronous actions that need taken are handled by the popular vendor libraries.",

During the off-season training period take a look at multi-threaded with something like camera vision processing in another thread. You’ll need to learn the sophisticated techniques of inter-process communications at least with Atomic… types, synchronized, wait/notify. If two processes access the same variable or object at the same time you get horrible trash without proper communications.\n\nNote that many of the classes we use on the robot are already multi-threaded such as obtaining sensor values, the libraries that set motor speeds and driver station joystick data acquisition. You don’t have to duplicate that scheme; it’s a waste.",

                    "cooked": "You might be thinking of the concept of non-blocking vs blocking methods. That is, functions that return immediately to the caller with the action performed in the “background” (non-blocking) or functions that do not return to the caller until the function has completed its action (blocking).\n\nThe set command is non-blocking so your second set command is also immediately used. Here’s the help for a Talon get position method that shows the option of blocking for awhile or completely non-blocking.\n\nSets the sensor position to the given value.\n\nParameters: sensorPos Position to set for the selected sensor (in raw sensor units). pidIdx 0 for Primary closed-loop. 1 for auxiliary closed-loop. timeoutMs Timeout value in ms. If nonzero, function will wait for config success and report an error if it times out. If zero, no blocking or checking is performed.\n\nsensorPos Position to set for the selected sensor (in raw sensor units).\n\npidIdx 0 for Primary closed-loop. 1 for auxiliary closed-loop.\n\ntimeoutMs Timeout value in ms. If nonzero, function will wait for config success and report an error if it times out. If zero, no blocking or checking is performed.\n\nYou do have to have some care when using non-blocking methods and not assume an action has completed before relying on that action. For example, with the set motor speed command if you set the same motor to different speeds in the same robot iteration it’s not well defined exactly which set will work and when because the background process sending the command to the motor controller is running parallel with and not synchronized to your process.\n\nThat example may be somewhat unusual but easily created with state machines that we use where a state starts a motor and cleans up after itself and stops the motor. The next state may or may not start the motor again. We don’t really want the intermediate stop to work but sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn’t. We keep a variable to store the desired speed and at the end of the robot iteration the last set wins and is the one we actually use for our set command.\n\nAnother very common example is setting an encoder or gyro position to say 0 and then assuming that’s the position but that command is slow and the set is actually set sometime later.",
