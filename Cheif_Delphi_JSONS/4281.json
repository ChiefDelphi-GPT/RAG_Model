We are using the new ThriftyBot Swerve modules with the Thrifty absolute encoders on our robot this year.  Getting the modules up and running using YAGSL was much easier than we anticipated, and we had high hopes of a smooth build season.\n\nThe first issue we ran into was getting the absolute encoder data from each module to get the offests.  For some reason when we look at the network tables in the Smart Dashboard it only gives us the raw absolute encoder value for our 3rd module.  The others do not show up.  We do see module data in the “Module States” area in the tables but these do not coincide with the absolute encoder data.  We needed to plug each encoder into the #2 rio Analog input to get the data, but we were able to get the offests eventually.  If anyone knows how we can do this easier next year it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nSecond we seem to be having an issue getting data from our 4th swerve module.  When we look at the “Module States” information in the network tables on robot connection, we see the first three modules giving a different angle reading (the decimal values jumping around), but the fourth module is always a solid zero with no decimal movement.  When we physically turn the module it starts counting (I’m assuming due to the relative encoder).  It almost seems like it isn’t pulling the absolute encoder data.  We switched out 3 different encoders, we changed the data wire running to the Rio, we even swapped in a different Rio thinking it was a bad analog port.  However, when we plug this encoder into port 2 (the one that shows raw absolute encoder data on the network tables) the encoder values change when we rotate the module.  When we try to give this module an offset it has no effect.  The only way we can drive our robot is to align this one wheel with our jig before we power on the robot so it is facing forward before it gets power.\n\nPlease help if you can!  We are hoping to get this drive based wrapped up this weekend so we can start attaching the other parts of our robot.\n\nWe have our program published to a gitlab, so hopefully you have access to it if you need to see it.\n\n2025 9578_PlayerOne SwerveProgram",

I just did an experiment where I swapped the CAN ID’s and encoder ID’s in the config Json files of my front left module (which is working fine) and the back right module (which doesn’t seem like it’s sending absolute encoder data).  After I power cycled the robot the issue was no longer with the original rear right module.  The problem migrated to whichever module I designated as the rear right module.\n\nOne of the values on the SmartDashboard should be the Module State angle of the Rear Right Module.  No matter which way the wheel starts at it will always show zero.\n\nAfter I swapped the info of the left front and rear right config Json files.  The SmartDashboard is still zero for the last module, and now my front left module won’t initialize to a zero position at startup. From what I can see it seems to me that the encoder is sending data through the analog port on the Rio, but for some reason the YAGSL library isn’t sending it through, but only for the Rear Right module.",
