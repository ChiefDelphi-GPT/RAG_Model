So for example if we are using code to target a pose and drive to it, I’ve seen our robot pose behave kinda erratically.\n\nI guess we could change it to not be a constant feedback loop (every update loop we would take our current robot pose and then calculate how to drive to reach that pose). and more take a snapshot and start the command to get there.\n\nI’m just curious if anyone has had any similar struggles with this and how they accomplished this. Some of this might be noisy  data coming back from photonVision unfortunatly as well (although it seems pretty stable… i suspect once the robot starts moving it becomes challenging)",

Only thing is your pulling it out of the PhotonVision pose estimator so its almost chicken or the egg.\n\nTake your current pose, compare it to the new estimated pose and determine if the distance makes sense. I guess you could just blindly trust your initial pose and let that ‘geo’ you on the field, and then after that make it respect being within a certain distance.\n\nIMO i’d rather restrict what distance of targets get let into the photonVision pose estimation echo system but I guess thats just a similar way to do it. We have a back and front facing camera and when we initially put it out on the field we were getting so much noise from the back camera getting targets from the other side of the field.",
