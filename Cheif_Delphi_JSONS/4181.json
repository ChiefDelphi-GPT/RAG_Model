                    "cooked": "I’m the lead programmer on our elevator for this season, and I have it working perfectly in sim… when gravity is disabled. I’ve tried adding PID values like kG, and kS, but these values don’t change the height of the elevator and instead seem to affect the minimum height instead. We have a method in our commands to holdElevator() where it sets the position to go to as the current position, effectively holding the elevator in place, or so it should. I’ve also tried manually adding a feed forward value to the elevator movement code just to see if that would work. It did work when it was added to the open loop code, but the instant we switched back to closed loop and then back to open loop, it stopped working. I’m not even sure if getting it working with sim is necessary because last year our climber didn’t simulate gravity in sim and it still stayed at its position when it was reached. Is there a way I’m using the PID values wrong or something?

                    "cooked": "Let’s first try to understand the problem.  If we draw a free body diagram of the elevator, what forces are acting upon it?  What forces must be applied to reach equilibrium?  This isn’t a lab environment, so things like friction are not negligible.\n\nFor the next few parts, lets just set kP, kI, and kD to 0.  Our goal is to obtain equilibrium.\n\nNext, let’s think through what PID is.  It’s a closed-loop control scheme.  What do each of the constants represent?  kP is “proportional”, and essentially controls how quickly to get to the target.  kI is an “integral” component and resolves historical “steady state” error.  kD is a “derivative”, and affects how quickly the output can change, essentially controlling the “smoothness” of the curve.  Technically kG, kS, kV, and kA are not part of “ PID ”, but are separate components used to calculate a constant feed-forward component which gets added to the PID output. CTRE libraries abstract that calculation away from you, but it’s useful to know how it applies.\n\nThe purpose of feed-forward is to isolate the mechanism from outside forces, in this case, to apply just enough force to counteract gravity.  Given the descriptions of each component here (sounds like you’re going for position control), your kS (not used in your code), kV, and kA are not needed.  Be sure to read their descriptions to understand why.\n\nThat leaves kG as the sole component to configure, but what should it be?  Well, what units are we working with?  kG is in Volts.  This is directly related to the voltage applied to the motor!  So to figure out what number to give it, you could manually drive that motor until it starts to move up on its own.  Thats your starting point (and a maximum possible value), but we dont want it to move so need something less than that.  If you were to manually hold it up and apply power until it no longer tries to fall back down (i.e. it maintains position), that’s now the minimum possible value.  Realistically, any value within that range could be viewed as “good enough”.  The ideal value would allow you to manually move the elevator up and down (not controlled by input) and it would stay wherever you leave it.\n\nOf course, it’s not necessarily safe to have your hands in a powered/enabled mechanism, so thats where other tooling comes into play.  You could write encoder values to networktables or a dashboard and programmatically increase the voltage until applied until you see movement.  In fact, this is essentially how the WPILib SysID tool works, so learning/using that tool is also an excellent option.\n\nOnce you have it in equilibrium, now you can start working on your PID constants.  The PID controller will have much less work to do as its only calculating the difference “in a vacuum” rather than dynamically combating external forces as well.  This also means you shouldn’t need to bother with kI (commonly used to counteract steady-state error like what would happen with a PD controller without a FF component trying to move against gravity).\n\nOf course, there are also ways to mathematically calculate these constants (or at least a starting point for them so you know what order of magnitude to work with) without ever turning the bot on, but where’s the fun in that?",

The difference being that there’s a tiny amount of time delay and energy losses that allow it to slip just enough with a constant force applied such as by gravity.\n\nThe caveat to this is if your gear ratio is high enough, it would make the mechanism very difficult or impossible to back-drive. The faster the motor tries to spin in brake mode, the more “resistive” power the controller will put into the motor to maintain the position, and a higher gear ratio would make the motor spin faster for the same distance traveled for the overall mechanism.\n\nAnyway, I think I’m over-explaining… if any of that doesn’t make sense to you and some self-guided research (google, chatgpt, whatever) doesn’t help, let me know where you’re lost and I’ll do my best to clarify what I said.

If it works it works!\n\nA small bit of elaboration: Slip can be an issue if you need to hold a motors position over a long period of time but in the case of an elevator you’ll often be bringing it up, doing something while it’s up, then bringing it back down.\n\n(I am a student programmer which means I likely don’t have enough experience with frc mechanisms to talk to this but my general philosophy is that if it works it works!)",
