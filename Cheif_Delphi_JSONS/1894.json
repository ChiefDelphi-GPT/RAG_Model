                    "cooked": "Due to fire codes, we’re losing a shed behind our school (near our room) where we store wood and metal stock, so we have to bring the metal back into the shop. The team has existed for over a decade & has accumulated a lot of “usable scrap” and “misc inventory” (widely varying sizes of bar, round tube, and a whole lot more).\n\nOur metal shop is not large, and we’re going to have to let a lot of stuff go. There’s a metal shop at the local makerspace that will take some of it off our hands, I’m sure.\n\nSo… We’re at this inflection point, and I’m curious what teams do about less-used stock and scrap. I think we may shift to keeping in inventory only what we know will be used on robots and getting rid of everything else, and then IF something different is needed in a given season, order it. But that will mean getting rid of a bunch of cool stuff we could eventually use… sometime ;). I frequently go find a piece of scrap to make a piece (bracket or whatever) to solve a little problem, and we’ll be losing some of that. But the space savings probably makes it worth it. Anyway, if you have wisdom to share on this topic, please do. Thanks.",
