None were mechanically binding. Current limiting is applied, and flat tops are seen in the log files so we’re fairly confident it’s working correctly.\n\nTrying to get to the bottom of it because replacing Krakens sure is expensive! But, hey, we have proof auto can score 2 game pieces with a busted leg!\n\nI’ve seen posts about some issues with wires, but nothing involving motors overheating or burning out since the firmware changes.\n\nAnyone seen anything along these lines?\n\nThanks in advance!",

There’s got to be some root cause here.\n\nimslowafboi1402:\n\nI feel like it is worth noting that the swerve modules these motors were attached to (all these motor failures happened on the swerve drivetrain) had gears that were worn and shredded, leaving metal dust on top and around the modules.\n\nStuff like this also makes me a question a lot more about what you’re doing. Are you not greasing your modules?\n\nPost your code up, I think that would be the most helpful.",
