This got me thinking about CTRE can devices and how you can have multiple on the same bus with the same ID.  If you then change the ID of one of them, it seems only one will receive the message and allow you to change its ID, allowing you to differentiate between them again.  I don’t quite understand how the identifier of the CAN frame gets determined so that only one device receives the message(obviously the ID doesn’t correspond ).  If anyone could shed some light on the topic I’d appreciate it!",

                    "cooked": "Complete speculation follows\n\nThere’s a few ways to deal with conflicts, which could be implemented in firmware.\n\nIt isn’t super hard to know when an ID conflict exists since every device has access to every message on the bus. In CAN , a logical 0 is usually the actively driven bit and a logical 1 is achieved by letting the resistor pull the line voltage. So for instance, when device A is trying to write a 1 to device C, but device B is trying to write a 0, device C will see unexpected 0s in the datastream. Usually CAN devices can ‘hear’ their own messages, and could catch that what they ‘hear’ back isn’t what they ‘said’. So we could detect a fault condition (either same-id or simultaneous transmission)\n\nTo fix it, the firmware could do a few things on its own, I’d speculate: a, it could increment its ID by some fixed amount to an unlikely-to-be-used range. CAN supports 11-bit addresses (0-512) so adding some fixed value to one conflicting-ID-device would resolve it (e.g. device A is ID1, device B goes ID1->ID21, b/c it’s unlikely to have >20 canbus devices in FRC ) b, it could set up a time-shifting scheme where each conflicting-ID-device is only talking to the controller at set times, or on set messages, etc. (e.g. 1, device C, the main controller, gives some “clock pulse” message to the conflicting-ID devices A and B, then A has the priority til the next “clock pulse”, then it’s B’s turn, etc etc 2. Device A transmits even-numbered frames, device B odd-numbered, and set up some kind of data frame serial-numbering inside your data. That way the controller knows who it’s talking with, implicitly)\n\nMain point is, the CAN ID implementation doesn’t really matter to the specification, as long as everyone on the network knows what’s up: lots of devices actually add excess data to the ID field (e.g. message priority, b/c the spec says that lowest ID gets top priority/dealt with first).",

This should work even if they are all the same device, from the same manufacturer, and all with (the same) default CAN ID.  This doesn’t have to work from the robot program, but it does need to work from the vendor configuration utility.  In this scenario, the leading bits, normally used to address/identify a specific device are all the same.\n\nI have not seen any specification more detailed than the one I linked before (and if I had, there are probably safety reasons why this isn’t in wider circulation – vague recollections of this discussion coming up before).  But, every device typically has a unique serial number, permanently burned in by the manufacturer.\n\nThe spec I linked did show a “Device Query” and “Device Assign” broadcast message.  I’d imagine the general practice is for the PC running the config utility to send a “Device Query” message, and then for all devices to reply with a message containing its unique serial number.  The config utility then builds a list of devices, each with a unique serial number.  The bus arbitration procedure ensures each device gets to send its reply, without colliding with messages from other devices.  If the serial number is included in the replies, the messages will be unique, even if many of the leading bits are not.\n\nThe “Device Assign” broadcast message would likely include both the serial number of the target device and the CAN ID to be assigned.  This is a little bit like MAC addresses and IP addresses for Ethernet, but not in all ways.  One could snoop the CAN bus or go searching for a more detailed spec, but I think this is probably enough of an answer.  It may work slightly differently, this is also just speculation.",

                    "cooked": "For CTRE devices they essentially use two sets of src addresses.  There is the user assigned address which multiple controllers can be configured to the same one and there is a secondary src address that is claimed during startup. The roborio basically says who wants address 1.  One or more controllers will responds with a serial number as data in the packet and the address they want.  The roborio will respond back with the serial number as data confirming that device gets the ID.  Then the process repeats itself until there are no longer any devices left that need a device.\n\nOnce these claimed management ids are established then they can target specific devices with blink led command, change user assigned address, and update firmware and know they are only talking to one specific device.\n\nI’ve purposefully left out the specific arbitration IDs used and simplified the process in the description.  If you really want to understand how the process works connect up a CAN logger and take a trace during boot up.  Then go through the trace looking at each arib ID one at a time.  Take into account the total number of times the arb ID is sent.  An ID that is send at 10hz likely isn’t used for address claim.  An ID that is send a handful times might be.  When you start to see patterns and arb ids being sent the same number of times then filter on a group and see if you can figure out the interactions.",
