                    "cooked": "Hello  \nWe are considering adding a CNC Break to our toolset. We use 0.125 aluminum in our designs and typically order sheet metal from FabWorks. The prices from FW are not bad but the time-to-delivery is often 7+ days for us making it prohibitive.  \n\nOur goals are several-fold: introducing students to metal bending designing for it shortening turn-time so that we use sheet metal more often expanding our use of sheet metal since I view it as a core capability reducing mass for robot mechanisms.  \n\nWe tend to use a lot of tube stock in our robot designs since it gives us easy 90-degree surfaces. And it is a powerful technique but I think sheet metal can be lighter allow more design freedom and might be simpler.  \n\nAfter this year's champs we visited Robonauts (What a shop!) and saw their Langmuir Titan 25T CNC Break. It looks like we can get one with a reasonable set of tooling/fixtures for about $9K.  \n\nQuestions:  \nHow valuable is a break for FIRST Robotics Competition design?  \nCan you recommend a good break for 1/8\" aluminum?  \nDo you have the Titan 25T and if so do you recommend it?  \n\nThank you.  \nKevin Shaw  \nHead Coach, Team 3045 Gear Gremlins",

The Wazer Pro excels in aluminum processing up to 1/8 inch but needs attention for thicker materials beyond short periods. A common malfunction is backflow sensor issues, which can often be fixed with a few seconds adjustment. Mentioned individuals include @Wittry, @AllenGregoryIV, @rstockton429, and @R.C., discussing the pros and cons of the Wazer Pro. Another participant references the Titan25t, asking about CNC press brake usage. Multiple threads continue the conversation about these products and their performance.",

                    "cooked": "The Langmuir Titan 25T CNC brake system represents a significant leap forward in sheet metal bending technology, particularly for hobbyists and professionals in industries like FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC). While it shares a higher price tag compared to dedicated industrial machines, its advantages lie in its simplicity, reliability, and versatility. Unlike more advanced systems such as Amada or Trumpf, the Titan excels in cost-effectiveness and ease of use, though it may require more precise setup and testing compared to industrial-grade presses.\n\nKey features highlight its adaptability for various applications, including FRC robots. The system includes a comprehensive set of tools, such as dies and punches tailored to different material thicknesses, enabling users to bend parts accurately even for challenging geometries. The inclusion of optional enhancements like LED bracket holders and precision adjustments further extends its capabilities, offering greater customization and control.\n\nOne notable aspect is the system's performance compared to manual bending methods. It provides consistent results, reducing the reliance on skilled operators for every bend. However, its lower resolution compared to industrial machines means it may not achieve the same level of precision for extremely complex designs. Despite this trade-off, the Langmuir Titan remains an excellent choice for projects where budget and ease of use are priorities.\n\nFor those considering an upgrade, detailed purchasing guides and technical specifications are readily available, including lists of required components and tooling. Additionally, supplementary resources like video tutorials and design recommendations provide further assistance in maximizing the system's potential. Overall, while the Titan may not match the performance of professional-grade systems, it offers a practical solution for hobbyists and teams seeking reliable, affordable sheet metal bending solutions.",

To curb expectations, it’s not as good as a Trumpf or Amada or even the higher-end Chinese brake presses, but it still does the job.\n\nHelped RC tool this one out, and I gotta say, I was really impressed by the specs and the parts they made on this—it’s crazy how you can get anything in the ballpark of what we can do for 1/50th the cost of our Trumpf TruBend…\n\nIf any FIRST Robotics Competition teams end up getting a Titan25T or similar CNC brake, please take it very seriously. These machines are an order of magnitude easier to injure yourself on than other equipment most have in an FIRST Robotics Competition shop. These entry-level machines are missing tons of safety features that our industrial brakes have. Our press brakes are the only piece of equipment I wouldn’t feel comfortable having our kids run around with, as brakes require a certain level of finesse to operate safely.",

We have had this Baileigh manual brake for years and it has been great but takes a lot of test bends and quite a bit of time to dial in bends. It costs $4,200. We got the Langmuir Titan 25T in February when we lost access to NASA sheet metal bending. We ordered all of the accessories and all of the tooling available for just under $10,000 (Prices have gone up a bit since then). more than double the price? And that's a manual brake that has all the fancy bits. While this may be smaller than it used to be, it's still an enormous gap for most teams.",

Tooling for high-end applications is heat-treated to harden only the bending surfaces, preventing explosions and cleanly splitting under overload. Bending lifts the part upward, necessitating careful positioning; our machines include a light curtain to halt operations during unintended movements and a programmed sequence to allow operators sufficient time before the machine completes the bend.",

To address this, they developed a method involving sacrificial sheets placed under the main parts, allowing for a larger bend radius and preventing cracking. This technique was successfully applied to both 3/16\" polycarbonate and aluminum parts, demonstrating its effectiveness. While CNC brakes offer higher precision, their complexity makes the process more demanding. Notably, the primary intake structure on their 2023 robot was constructed using this method, showcasing its adaptability across different materials and applications.",

It’s generally recommended to bend cold at 90° or less and bend 20-40° past the desired final bend angle to account for spring back. Cold bending over 90° may exceed the elastic limit and preheating the bend line can prevent that. Increasing the bend radius will also reduce the risk of cracking.",
