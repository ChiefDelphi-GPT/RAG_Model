We have an important issue with space and component’s placement, we have a linear cascade of 3 stages connected by lift with drawer slides, extruded aluminium rectangular tube to support the bearing so the thread can slide and so the work, the rectangular tube is located between each drawer slide, as you can imagine it requires a lot of space in our robot. The question is, can we use 3d printed brackets for the bearings and attach them between each drawer slide, so in can be smaller? will it be strong enough to support some matches?\n\nI appreciate your help:)",

Generally when making gut check decisions on something like this without calculations or simulations for detailed analysis you need to at least understand how the component is going to be loaded and how you would expect the component to fail.\n\n3-D printed components of an appropriate thickness and infill can be quite strong in certain applications but can fail due to stress concentrations, point loads, or significant shear stresses parallel to the print layers. This also depends on the geometry of your part and the approach used for printing the part.\n\nCan you share photos, CAD, or more detail on the printer you plan to use to help understand the problem?",

                    "cooked": "3D printed parts can work well, though as others have stated, you have to be careful about putting them into shear stress across the layer lines. Ideally you want to design them so that if they have to take loads, they are taking it in compression.\n\nOne useful technique is to use the ability to create complex geometries to make printed parts that hold other parts in the correct orientation so that the loads mostly don’t go through the printed part. The printed part typically also serves as a drill/cut guide for the metal parts.\n\nFor example, if you need to put bearings on the end of a tube, the printed part fits onto the end of the tube and has insets where the bearings are placed, and bolts go through the printed part, the bearings, the tube, and then thread into an internal printed threaded hole of the printed part. You can also sometimes arrange the geometry so that instead of going through the tube, the bolts lie against the face of the tube and the expected loads push the bolt against the tube.\n\nSorry, it’s kind of hard to explain; but the basic idea is loads are always going metal-to-metal-to-metal. All the plastic has to do it keep the metal parts from falling apart.\n\nMy summer project was investigating how to use 3D printed parts to make common FRC mechanisms, and I’ve posted all the designs here: GitHub - RJWoodhead/FRC3DP\n\nI don’t have a linear cascade but there is a full elevator and a tube-in-tube-in-tube arm that have similar mechanisms. There’s also lots of assembly photos that might be helpful in wrapping your head around what can be done. The Fusion360 projects are all parametric so they might be adaptable to FTC-scale designs.\n\nFinally, one advantage of 3D-printed designs is that because they are typically very easy to assemble, you can build a spare or two that you can swap into the robot in a modular fashion. And if you’re really worried about how much force they can take, just build a test item, clamp it in a vice, and do some percussive testing (aka hit it with a baseball bat harder and harder until something happens). You may be pleasantly surprised at how much they can take, and for some reason students take great joy in helping determine the structural limits of a design.",
