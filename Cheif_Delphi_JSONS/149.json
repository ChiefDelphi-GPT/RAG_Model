Currently, our code allows us to use two cameras (Limelights 4) to align to either side of the coral station to score during tele-op. However, when we try to use this in autonomous mode, the path planner interferes with how the robot perceives its position, causing the autonomous mode not to move as desired. Does anyone have any tips?",

The user has provided a block of text that includes HTML tags and some technical jargon related to robotics or autonomous systems. My task is to clean up this text by removing the HTML tags and ensuring that the meaning remains intact while improving the grammar and punctuation. I need to make sure that the final output is a single paragraph without any line breaks, and I should change as little as possible to keep the original message clear.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the entire text carefully to understand the context. The text discusses tools like PathPlanner, Limelights (which seems to refer to something like Limelight), AprilTags, and mentions abbreviations like CD and LL, which probably stand for Chief Delphi and Limelight respectively. There's also mention of algorithms like PP auto builder and CORAL.\n\nLooking at the first paragraph: <p>The use of PathPlanner and Limelights are both rather complicated and as you see can work together or not. If you are more specific about your autonomous system and the algorithms you are using and exactly what you mean by “messes with”, then you can get better advice.</p>\n\nHere, I notice several things:\n1. The sentence starts with \"PathPlanner and Limelights\" – \"Limelights\" doesn't seem correct. Maybe it's a typo and should be \"Limelights\" referring to Limelight? Or perhaps \"Limelight\" was meant to be abbreviated as LL. But since the user mentioned keeping the original meaning, I'll assume it's Limelights, maybe a plural form, but that might be incorrect. However, without more context, it's hard to say. Alternatively, it might be a mistake, and they meant \"Limelight\". For now, I'll leave it as \"Limelights\".\n\n2. The word \"complicated\" is used twice in quick succession: \"both rather complicated and as you see...\" That feels repetitive. I can rephrase that to avoid redundancy.\n\n3. The last part says \"exactly what you mean by “messes with”\" – the quotation marks around \"messes with\" don't match the surrounding text. It looks like the user intended to use a term in quotes but didn't properly format it. Since we're removing HTML tags, the quotation marks might just be part of the text, but I need to ensure proper punctuation. So, I'll remove the backticks or quotation marks if necessary and adjust the sentence structure accordingly.\n\nMoving to the second paragraph: <p>Interpreting AprilTag positions should add to or replace your wheel and gyro odometry but you have to be selective about when and how much to believe or trust the AprilTag since they aren’t always or continuously accurate.</p>\n\nHere, I notice that \"add to or replace\" could be phrased more smoothly. Also, \"you have to be selective about when and how much to believe or trust\" sounds a bit awkward. Perhaps rephrasing to \"you must be selective about when and how much to trust\" would flow better.\n\nThird paragraph: <p>I’ve seen some complaints on CD about the LL4, I think, regarding its internal gyro so consider that might be hurting you and your robot gyro could be more accurate.</p>\n\nThis sentence has some issues. First, \"I’ve seen some complaints on CD about the LL4\" – CD is likely an abbreviation for Chief Delphi, which is a software tool. So, the preposition \"on\" doesn't quite fit here. It should be something like \"I’ve seen some complaints regarding CD about the LL4.\" Alternatively, since CD is an organization or software, it's more natural to say \"about CD\" without the preposition. Also, \"regarding its internal gyro\" – perhaps \"concerning its internal gyro\" would be better.\n\nAlso, the sentence ends abruptly with \"and your robot gyro could be more accurate.\" It feels like there's missing punctuation after \"gyro\" before \"could.\" So, adding a comma there would help.\n\nFourth paragraph: <p>My team uses one LL3G upgraded and it works well in autonomous with PP auto builder and our struggles are with pushing the limits of 4 or 4+ CORAL in autonomous as sometimes it doesn’t place a CORAL correctly. We use LL and PP on the fly for auto alignment in teleop for all CORAL placements with high rate of success.</p>\n\nSome observations here:\n- \"one LL3G upgraded\" – \"upgraded\" seems redundant because LL3G already implies it's an upgrade. Maybe just \"one LL3G.\"\n- \"pushing the limits of 4 or 4+ CORAL\" – \"of\" might not be necessary before CORAL. It should be \"pushing the limits of 4 or 4+ in CORAL.\"\n- \"as sometimes it doesn’t place a CORAL correctly\" – \"a\" before CORAL is needed for singular agreement.\n- \"with high rate of success\" – \"rate\" is often used uncountably, so it should be \"high rate of success.\"\n\nPutting it all together, I'll start by removing all HTML tags, which include the <p> tags and the span tags with their titles. Then, I'll address each grammatical issue and improve the flow where necessary.\n\nNow, considering all these points, here's how I'll clean up the text step by step.\n```",

Instead, we perform addVisionMeasurement, which uses the standard deviation of the tag position approximately twice the odometry value. Achieving accurate results requires significant effort, including hundreds of runs to fine-tune all parameters and adjust paths, as other teams have noted. While I feel we could have made improvements with occasional use of a proper resetOdometry, this would require additional hours of tuning that we don't have.",

I cannot recall a scenario where it would not be perfectly clear whether the robot is in the correct position or not. PP is not particularly adept at handling drastic changes in position, although it does attempt to adapt.\n\nAdditionally, there is an issue with PP and PathWeaver, which stop following the programmed path when they believe the task is complete, rather than waiting until the robot is in the correct pose. Teams that have not been meticulous in defining their robot's path and constraints may require additional driving, often incorporating a variant of the PID command referenced in the tutorial linked below, to complete the final movements.",
