Currently we use Code Academy and our own Java slides that go over syntax overviews with examples, but I want to develop some training that gets people “pulled” into programming and interested in Java.\n\nThe target demographic are students who have little to zero prior programming experience and join our programming team because it “looks cool” or because they are interested in doing it in the future (ex. pursuing CS, software development, etc.). The timeframe I’m looking for to implement this training is September to before build season, so they understand what’s going on in build season and can contribute.\n\nI’m looking for ideas on how to make this sort of training interesting so that newer students who might only have been slightly interested in Java before really love it.",

If you start off with the absolute basics of, e.g., running a motor, rather than going through all the subsystem and command junk right off the bat, you’ll get a reward quickly, encouraging them to keep going.\n\nThis is especially true for brand-new programmers. This could very well be the first time they EVER write any lines of code, and seeing come to life quickly leaves a good impression. Compare this to experienced programmers, who know that it’ll work out eventually.\n\nAlso: with more “advanced” stuff like commands and subsystems, you are introducing a very large margin for error. Seeing a compile error or the motor do nothing as the very first code they ever wrote is very discouraging. (flashbacks to my first Python program getting 6 syntax errors…)!",

The moment a student succeeds in making a robot move around on the floor, their eyes light up.\n\nOur minibot tutorial takes students through things step-by-step, providing all source code.  For our nerfbot tutorial, students must find and adapt solutions for themselves; we hope this is much more like the experience of being handed an FRC robot for programming.  For both, unlike most minibot kits, we have tried to make the experience as similar to programming an FRC robot as possible.  (If we were starting from scratch in 2022, we would definitely be taking a hard look at Romi .)\n\nIf you really want students to find programming interesting and engaging, it is important to solicit and respond to feedback.  One key piece of feedback we have gotten is that programming is more interesting and engaging for students when it is a social activity, not isolated and silent, talking only to adults.  We have no magic solution for this, but we encourage students to help each other, talk through their experience, do code reviews, and pair-program when appropriate.",
