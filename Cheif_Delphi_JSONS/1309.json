                    "cooked": "Last year, our team used a naming system so that the drive team could figure out what each auto did. the 3 closest notes were notes A (closest to amp), B, and C (closest to podium) and then the midline notes were D,E,F,G, and H.\n\nThis year, this naming system will not work because there are so many more places to score, for example, on level 2 there are 12 total places.\n\nif we tried to use a similar naming system to last year, for a 2 piece auto, we would end up with something like: L2S1R_L2S1L where L{number} represents the level, S{number} represents a side of the reef, and then the last letter of each position denoting left or right side. I think that this naming system will just end up being very confusing for the drive team, and so I was wondering if anyone has come up with a better naming system that allows me to specify which location on the reef will be scored on? This is important because if we start scoring multiple pieces, the names for the autos will get really long and confusing really fast.\n\nI am posting this early in the season for two reasons. firstly, by the time our team gets to making autos, we will hopefully have a good naming convention to use. Secondly, if decided early, it will give other teams a chance to learn and potentially make whatever naming convention that is most easy to understand standard on their team as well, or at least be familiar with it. If we can come up with a standard, it would greatly improve the effectiveness of pre-match strategy discussions between teams as supposed to “we will score on the closest side on the left L2.”\n\nso, with that being said, what are some ideas for naming systems? and, do you think that having a naming system become commonly accepted is a good idea?\n\nalso, if you find a reply with a naming system you like, please like it so that we can compile the general consensus and use the most liked system.\n\nSo far, from what I am seeing, I believe that it would be best for 2 naming systems. one for software, where it needs to be compact, and one for callouts, which is longer and a little more descriptive. for software and auto purposes, I think that using the naming system that first provided (see @Amicus1 ’s reply) for the branches and then a number to denote the level would be best, as something like H2 or A3 is very compact. for callouts, I think both @w4drone ’s (just being descriptive) and @jedgar6 ’s (using clock) reply are good ideas.",
