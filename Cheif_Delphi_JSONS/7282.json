                    "cooked": "I am happy to announce the beta release of QFRCDashboard , a high-performance, low-footprint, reliable, FOSS dashboard for FRC use, written in pure Qt and C++.\n\ndashboard 1366×721 350 KB\n\ndashboard 1366×721 350 KB\n\ndashboard 1366×721 350 KB\n\nQFRCDashboard has been designed from the ground up to perform well with minimal memory and CPU footprint, and to be as extensible as possible without sacrificing developer experience. Compared to Shuffleboard on a ThinkPad X220:\n\nThe tiny footprint of QFRCDashboard is thanks to a variety of factors:\n\nIt’s written in the highly performant, lightweight C++ and Qt\n\nContains no menu that subscribes to every topic at once\n\nDuplicate subscriptions to topics refer to the same subscription; no double-referencing topics\n\nWidgets only update or do any paint events when they need to, such as a resize or NT update.\n\nQFRCDashboard is available on Linux (AppImage, system folder, binary) and Windows (portable), through GitHub Actions. QFRCDashboard has been tested on Windows, but has yet to see extensive testing. Linux builds have been tested thoroughly.\n\nThese builds currently use the master branch of WPILib, meaning that you must use this with a 2024 robot project. If there’s enough demand I will gladly create builds for 2023 WPILib.\n\nQFRCDashboard does not support theming at the moment. By the time of the official 1.0.0 release, QFRCDashboard will receive an “official” theme, in the same vein as Qt’s Elegant Dark.\n\nWhile Shuffleboard’s custom widget plugin system was extremely powerful, it was also just as complicated for the end user. Thus, to simplify widget developer’s lives, QFRCDashboard has no plugin system. Instead, custom widgets are created directly in the code of QFRCDashboard, allowing developers complete control over the widget’s layout, type, data representation, and more. However, steps have been taken to ensure that registering a widget into the QFRCDashboard meta-system is as convenient and simple as possible.\n\nQFRCDashboard will contain a developer’s guide for creating widgets soon.\n\nWhile not every widget from Shuffleboard is available, many have new features added, and there are some new ones.\n\nAll widgets have editable fonts for their title and, if applicable, their text–this includes font size!\n\nString Display\n\nInt & Double Displays\n\nInt & Double Dials The starting angle of the dials are now configurable, as is the range. Note that a 0 starting angle is the bottom.\n\nThe starting angle of the dials are now configurable, as is the range.\n\nNote that a 0 starting angle is the bottom.\n\nBoolean Color Display Added support for changing to various preset shapes. (Hexagon, Rectangle, Triangle, Circle)\n\nAdded support for changing to various preset shapes. (Hexagon, Rectangle, Triangle, Circle)\n\nBoolean Checkbox The checkbox size is editable.\n\nThe checkbox size is editable.\n\nCamera View This lacks support for getting views from CameraServer, this will be added soon.\n\nThis lacks support for getting views from CameraServer, this will be added soon.\n\nField2d Supports built-in images and even custom field images! Editable robot size\n\nSupports built-in images and even custom field images!\n\nEditable robot size\n\nSendable Chooser\n\nEnum Widget A completely new widget. This widget takes in a string, and changes its color depending on the string. All key-value (string-color) pairs are editable. Like the boolean color widget, the shape is editable.\n\nA completely new widget. This widget takes in a string, and changes its color depending on the string.\n\nAll key-value (string-color) pairs are editable.\n\nLike the boolean color widget, the shape is editable.\n\nComing soon will be:\n\nGraphs CSV Export Configurable axes Multiple lines and values Static values in the graph Configurable colors\n\nCSV Export\n\nConfigurable axes\n\nMultiple lines and values\n\nStatic values in the graph\n\nConfigurable colors\n\nFMSInfo\n\nCommand Activation Distinction between toggle and instant commands. This is a high priority right now, expect this by beta 5.\n\nDistinction between toggle and instant commands.\n\nThis is a high priority right now, expect this by beta 5.\n\nSwerve Widget\n\nDrag & Drop This is a high priority right now, expect this by beta 5.\n\nThis is a high priority right now, expect this by beta 5.",

Text widgets are a title and text line edits, color display is a title edit and a QFrame, etc. Using UI files may still have some benefit, but this combined with the polymorphism required for much of the dashboard’s functionality I’m unsure. I’ll take a look though!\n\nMy issues with Qt Designer are related to the application just kinda not working correctly. This may be my fault as I’m using Sway without any Qt configs…",
