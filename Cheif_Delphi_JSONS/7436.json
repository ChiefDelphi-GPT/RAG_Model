                    "cooked": "Hi everyone,\n\nMy team, 6838, has an issue in that the battery voltage is dropping to 6-7 Volts while running the chassis motors only.  We use mk4i L2 with 8 Falcons with a PDH and rio 1. We tried both newer and older batteries and bought a new one to test. It changed nothing. We also tried running each drive motor individually via Phoenix Tuner to see if any motor draws a higher current or if the voltage drops when a particular motor works. Running each motor at full speed, each one resulted in the same voltage drops from approximately 12.4 Volts to 10V. We also monitored PDH ’s current outputs using the Hardware Client. All were normal (there were only some rapid rises that did not affect the fuzes).\n\nAfter running the drive motors on the ground for 40 seconds, the main breaker heats up and turns off the robot automatically.\n\nWe thought as a motor may be causing a drop in the voltage, it may have an abnormal internal resistance either caused by a broken wire or anything else. I am not sure if this is the correct method, but we tried to measure the resistance of each motor by placing the probes on the motor’s power cables. Three of the motors’ resistance values fluctuated between 45-60 and after a couple of seconds, the multimeter monitored Open Loop. One motor doesn’t show in any numbers, the multimeter says it is Open Loop. Maybe there is an issue with that.\n\nTo solve that, we are planning to change the motor which results in an Open Loop with a spare Falcon. If that does not work, I think we might change the PDH to a PDP .\n\nIt would be nice to hear anyone’s opinion on that.",

                    "cooked": "Each of the Falcon 500 motors can draw 783 watts (theoretical max) which is about 65 amps on a 12 volt nominal circuit so it could be that you’re drawing about 260 amps through the main braker when at full acceleration. I am certainly not an expert in programming or the WPI control libraries but I know there is a current limiting method (for Java) provided for the Talon FX controller that is built into the Falcon, that should be used, and set to 40 amps for less than a second in your code (if not done already) . On the mechanical side you should check for any binding that may be in your swerve modules. Check that the wheels spin mostly freely (robot off) for both drive and steering, sometimes screws get tightened too much and cause the gears to bind. Also when measuring the resistance across the power wires of each motor you’re measuring across the power transistor that is part of the Talon FX controller and not across the motor winding like you would in a DC brushed motor. I’m not sure what the expected response should be when doing that but it is concerning that one motor behaves differently, but I would expect that motor to show higher power usage in Phoenix if it was bad or that it would not operate at all. I apologize if this is information you already know, but best of luck to your team, this is certainly a curious problem. PS: in my experience with older control systems (2007-2018) I’ve seen battery voltages drop to about 11v, but only with a dead battery when it was time to change. But it doesn’t sound like the battery is your issue.",
