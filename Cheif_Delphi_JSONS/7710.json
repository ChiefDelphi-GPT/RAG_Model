                    "cooked": "Hello CD . I’m facing this very odd problem. I’m using a combination of feedforward and profiledpid to control two TalonFXs to move a single-jointed arm. I’m using WPILib classes and not Motion Magic or the internal PID of the Falcon 500s. The motion profile is smooth but my arm stutters when reaching certain points. It looks like it pauses and tries to resume the profile’s trajectory. Here a graph yellow being the setpoints of the motion profile and blue being the actual values. You can see at around 22.2 seconds and 24.2 seconds the jumps happening. image 719×377 45.8 KB\n\nimage 719×377 45.8 KB\n\nimage 719×377 45.8 KB\n\nHere’s a video, you can see the motor pausing and then resuming the trajectory:\n\nGoogle Drive file.\n\nThe odd thing is the code worked perfectly fine before. We did face a major issue and had to take apart the whole arm and assemble it together but mechanically everything is identical. We also noticed the arm runs little bit slower than before (battery voltage were close both of the times). Another thing to note is that I only have a P value for the tilt due to the high gear ratio. Will adding a D stop the overshooting? Another thing to note is that we are facing high CPU usage on the rio 1. Around 80% to 90%. Thank you!",

                    "cooked": "You’re likely seeing the effects of pauses due to Java garbage collection or other issues related to high CPU utilization. For all of the points of stuttering you mention, the profile itself appears to be paused for an extended period of time. If the pause is 100 ms, for example, the motor will follow the previous output of ProfiledPIDController for that 100 ms, but the profile is only updated according to a fixed time period (default 20 ms, your regular robot loop time). As a result, your motor “overshoots” the profile and needs to back up to recover, even though the issue is with the profile falling behind.\n\nThere are two ways to fix the issue. One is to use measured time deltas for the motion profile, which ProfiledPIDController does not support out of the box. The other, which we recommend to most teams, is to use Motion Magic®. This has the advantage of updating the profile more quickly than your main robot loop, the profile being unaffected by Java GC, and your feedforwards and PID updating at a much faster rate, improving the smoothness of the system.\n\nPhoenix 6 supports onboard kG, kS, kV, and kA feedforwards with Motion Magic®, and we have documentation explaining how to set it up.  You can also get the current Motion Magic® setpoints using getClosedLoopReference() (position setpoint) and getClosedLoopReferenceSlope() (velocity setpoint) if you ever need to do additional feedforward calculations on the roboRIO.",

One question that I have is that, will the values that I calculated for this subsystem translate over well for the Motion Magic? Will the kG, kS, kV, and kA that I found from SysID useful for the Motion Magic or do we have to do hand tuning? Do I also have to retune my PID if I decide to switch over? We are currently using rotations as the main unit.",

If you were just using the Talon FX getPosition() for your measurement, for example, then the position and velocity units are already the same (rotations). However, if you were scaling the Talon FX position by a gear ratio in your robot code, you will want to set the Talon FX SensorToMechanismRatio config to that gear ratio, or otherwise scale down your gains (excluding kS and kG) by the gear ratio.\n\nYou will also want to make sure output units are the same. If you are currently passing the output of ProfiledPIDController to setVoltage() or a VoltageOut request, then you will want to use MotionMagicVoltage . On the other hand, if you are using set() or a DutyCycleOut request, you will want to use MotionMagicDutyCycle .\n\nWhile your current PID values will work, you can also more likely than not use stronger PID values with Motion Magic® because the onboard PID runs at 1 kHz. In SysId, you can set the “Controller Period (ms)” to 1 when using onboard PID .\n\nAdditionally, if you find that your feedforward and PID values do not work with Motion Magic®, we have an example of using SysId with our SignalLogger. You can use Tuner X to convert the resulting hoot files to wpilog for use with SysId. You would select the Talon FX MotorVoltage, Position, and Velocity signals in SysId.",

We switched over to Motion Magic and used the same feedforward gains. The minimum rotation unit is 0 and maximum is 33.69. When assigning a setpoint above 0, the Motion Magic doesn’t follow it but when assign the setpoint exactly at 0, it does follow it. What could be the problem? When thing to note is that we are using limit switches to zero out the encoders of the TalonFX and it’s directly plugged into the limit switch ports. I have turned off the ForwardLimitEnable and ReverseLimitsEnable to false. Do I need to refresh the getClosedLoopReference() StatusSignal just like the single-jointed arm?",

The minimum rotation unit is 0 and maximum is 33.69.\n\nThis sounds like your units have changed, since Motion Magic® uses rotations after the SensorToMechanismRatio while your previous ProfiledPIDController used meters. You may need to adjust kV, kA, and PID values as a result. Your Motion Magic® cruise velocity and acceleration may also be too low if they are currently defined in meters.\n\nJaiCodes:\n\nI did set the update frequency and it still stays at 14.\n\nI’d like to look into this more. How are you refreshing the ClosedLoopReference status signal? Are you just calling getClosedLoopReference().getValue() , or are you caching the signal and manually refreshing? If the latter, are you calling refresh()/waitForUpdate() , or are you doing BaseStatusSignal.refreshAll()/waitForAll() ?",
