                    "cooked": "We're thinking about redesigning our practice bot's elevator this summer to use continuous rigging instead of cascade. While primarily this is for practice, we're also evaluating whether a continuous elevator could be simpler or more efficient, particularly with more than 2 stages.\n\nWe've never constructed a continuous elevator before, so seeking advice is crucial. Looking at similar discussions, can anyone share their experiences or tips?\n\nOur team prioritizes reliability and learned from last year's issues with stripped elevator belts. Teams using HTD Belt Rigging faced challenges, with many teams using a spool made from 1 to 2-inch OD tubing (as demonstrated by team 111). Questions remain: how many wraps are optimal, how to manage movement left and right, and whether eliminating the fixed anchor could help reduce spool size while maintaining tension consistency.\n\nAlternative methods involve looping the rope between two counter-rotating spools, as shown by @clydefrog88 and @Programming4907. However, concerns about the system's effectiveness persist.\n\nMaintaining rope tension is another consideration. We're unsure if a ratcheting drum anchor alone suffices or if additional tension springs are necessary.\n\nLastly, we seek advice on building and operating continuous elevators, focusing on reliability, ease of construction, and potential pitfalls.",

Our pulleys weren't counter-rotating, and we didn't like how the rope rubs on itself. Instead, we used circular grooves in each pulley and offset the top and bottom spools by half a groove. This ensures the rope moves over by one full groove from top to bottom and back again, keeping the spool-off points consistent. Ideally, the connection point on the elevator should align with these spool-off points for optimal performance.",

This caused the rope to move over by one full groove from top to bottom repeatedly, ensuring the rope always spools off the same points on the spools. This setup appears very similar to how some building elevators are rigged according to a reference link. Do you think this approach has any issues? Would you use it again in the future?",

                    "cooked": "An important note: I have never constructed nor been part of a team that built a multi-stage elevator; however, I recognize that a few theoretical aspects may exist. Regarding the biggest disadvantage associated with rope or smooth belts, unless you have an anchored reference point, you cannot rely on the position of the drive pulley as a substitute for elevator height. At minimum, you would require a couple of limit switches for calibration or recalibration purposes. When using cascade systems, anchors are generally easier due to shorter travel distances, but with continuous systems, achieving consistent results typically requires an unusually long constant-force spring, such as one found in tape measures. I stumbled upon this solution while attempting to construct a simple sensor setup for my 2015 single-stage elevator, though I did not implement it in competition. However, it inspired an idea, making it our most ambitious sensor concept up to that point. \n\nAn alternative approach involves using multiple wraps, whether counter-rotating or not, which enhances grip on the pulleys for a given tension, addressing the aforementioned challenge. Counter-rotation minimizes differences in pulley twist. Additionally, when employing multiple wraps without counter-rotation, simply increasing pulley size and adjusting gearing proportionally can yield better results. To manage tension effectively, consider intentional over-tensioning or under-tensioning of springs during both match preparation and operation. This decision depends on how you configure your system before and after the match. Lastly, while I haven't tested this myself, experimenting with natural versus artificial materials, along with surface treatments, could prove beneficial if grip strength becomes an issue.",

                    "cooked": "The spring is there to account for the changing tension resulting from unequal/uneven tension as the Dyneema wraps over itself. If you use a continuous tension system or the drum method you can avoid the need for a spring. The best tensioning method involves ratchets. Dyneema must be checked regularly for chafe points to ensure confidence in the system. It’s easy to wear through it. Regarding stretch Dyneema doesn’t really stretch once set. High-tech lines exhibit ‘creep.’ A great article on this topic is available at [Samson Rope’s Technical Bulletin](https://www.samsonrope.com/docs/default-source/technical-bulletins/tb_understanding-creep_mar2012_web.pdf). Checking Dyneema regularly for chafe points is crucial. Most of the Dyneema used in robotics is the lower-quality non-pre-stretched version. At 20% load and a creep rate of .1%/month a typical 15-foot run would creep .18 inches in a month. What most teams refer to as ‘stretch’ is the knots working in and setting under load.",

Larger diameter results in a lower fleet angle which makes things easier. Extra diameter does require more reduction but its a small price to pay for making the rigging just behave better.\n\nIf your fleet angle is small enough it should just behave. Helical grooves can be added to the spool to improve spooling behavior with larger fleet angles or in other suboptimal rigging setups and I generally recommend adding them anyway.\n\nI mean you can do this but I’d rather just tie or clamp the rope off on the spool and never have to worry about if my tension is perfect or not.\n\nUnderstanding that losing tension is what causes rope winches to tangle or slip. What’s the best method to keep both ends of the rope tensioned Is a ratcheting drum anchor good enough or do you need a tension spring too?\n\nA spring is required because spools have a fleet angle resulting in the elevator travel not quite being equal to the rope being unwound. I’ve tensioned rope successfully with as little as a single stiff spring and a clamp-off point but other features can be added to make tensioning easier.\n\nWhat other gotchas advice to you have for working with continuous elevators and/or Dyneema rigging?",

For teams that used HTD Belt rigging this year—what worked and what didn’t?  \n\nWe used PolyBelt belts on our elevator this year and couldn’t be happier with the performance. Some will say that you absolutely must use the WCP belt or else an official Gates belt but my experience this season is that is not the case. The Polybelt belt is cheaper, is kevlar reinforced, and can be purchased by the foot.",

The \"up\" and \"down\" spools are wound in opposite directions.\n\nThe most critical aspect of performing a lift like this is ensuring all corresponding pulleys match. For instance, our carriage was pulled by two pulleys going upward, both requiring the same winding direction and exact number of wraps without overlapping. Overlapping caused uneven diameters and inconsistent tension. Similarly, the downward pulleys matched their counterparts but were wound oppositely.\n\nTensioning involved attaching the down spools to a REV turnbuckle linked to a spring connected to the carriage's bottom rail. Up spools used a screw with a REV Shaft Collar sized just for an #10 screw; tightening the screw adjusted the tension smoothly.\n\nFriction between stages was an issue due to poorly manufactured REV MAXLift blocks. To initiate movement, we added surgical tubing under the carriage. Ideally, a CF spring might offer better performance.\n\nThe CAD wasn't fully updated, so spools weren't precisely designed, but pulleys were correctly placed. Our spools consisted of a VersaRoller between two Versahubs.",

Many lessons were learned during this process, and similar experiences would apply if transitioning to a multi-stage setup.  \n\nThe elevator saved significant space due to its design involving belts between tubings. Creating elevators with ropes was a new experience, but proper belt tensioning meant minimal adjustments during the season. The elevator proved highly reliable, functioning consistently even when spools broke, though belt tension quality fluctuated.  \n\nSeveral challenges arose, such as spool replacements needing strong materials and careful printing settings. Rigging added complexity, though thoughtful designs could simplify the process. Tubing slots required additional time for manufacturing. Costs for single-stage elevators were manageable, but multiple stages increased belt expenses.  \n\nThank you for your attention. Learning about elevator construction using ropes has been insightful!",

The system comprises three winches on a single shaft—two for ascending and one for descending. The ascent ropes originate from the winches and pass through pulleys installed on each elevator stage. These ropes are secured with ratchets in the innermost stage to regulate tension effectively. The descent rope originates from the middle winch and connects to a small knob located at the bottom of the top elevator stage.",

A team we're closely associated with (though not speaking for themselves) stripped one of their elevator belts just before the District Championship, necessitating some heroic measures to locate a replacement. Following this incident, at the Houston Championship, the pit announcers issued two separate requests for a \"spare 30 ft length of HTD belt\" during the event, indicating similar problems among other teams.  \n\nI'm curious if pulley diameter and belt tension play a role in distributing loads across multiple teeth, but I'm unsure how to prevent belt failure. This led me to ask for clarification.",
