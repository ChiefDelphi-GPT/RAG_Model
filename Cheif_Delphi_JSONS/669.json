                    "cooked": "Looking to the offseason, I think our team learned some lessons about pre-designing core mechanisms. This allows time to be shifted to thinking about the game and working on game specific solutions vs. doing grunt work to just get a robot designed and built.\n\nWe designed the chassis around Mk4ns last summer - which allowed for just updating a couple numbers in a table to have the chassis parametrically change size. We used Thrift Bot’s elevator design as well. This allowed for more time to be spent on the intake/deposit and climber.\n\nLooking back, having the chassis and elevator already “done” saved our bacon. The time we had could be spent on core gameplay decisions and designs vs foundational elements.\n\nThe team also saw how refined some of the robot designs are becoming - the take away lesson is that the designs are seasons old (2910, 1678, 5460, etc.) and they show this with the level of efficiency and refinement.\n\nWe don’t have 20 CAD capable kids running around, so we need to push work to the offseason.\n\nOf course this also extends to the vision, controls, and software side of the robot. My educated guess is that Orbit’s object recognition has been developed over multiple seasons. 2767’s crazy Einstein auto worked because their localization is that good , again multiple seasons of work.\n\n(This is my working thesis as to how the top teams keep raising the ceiling.)\n\nSo, this is what we’ve been kicking around for summer / fall projects for the CAD (and software) team.\n\nChassis - already have but can refine\n\nBumpers - tie this to the chassis parametrics.\n\nShooter & turret - “borrow” some of the better designs from 2022 and '20/21?\n\nElevator - continuous stringing\n\nPink arm & shoulder - ?\n\nSpindexer - ?\n\nFour-Bar intake (at least work out the drive)\n\nIntake rollers (254’s concept)\n\nProbably on the ambitious side, we’ll pare this down a bit I’m sure.\n\nWondering what projects other teams are going to take on along this line of thinking?",

For example, we have lots of Infinite Recharge and Rapid React game pieces, as well as cargo from Charged Up. One of my offseason training ideas was to ask newer members to test and create subsystems like intakes, shooters, end effectors, etc, for these old game pieces. Figured this would give them the best opportunity to learn the iteration and CAD process of making a subsystem.",
