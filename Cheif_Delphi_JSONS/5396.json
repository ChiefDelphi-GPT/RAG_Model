                    "cooked": "We have just in the last week or so had time to try the beta version of WPILib for 2025 and we are having a few more problems that usual. I realise that it is just a beta version, but build season is not far away and so I assume it is not going to change too much from here. We do use C++ and perhaps it does not get as much testing as Java.\n\nWe basically have two big problems:\n\nBuilding C++ is always a bit slow and in my experience robot code is particularly bad. However, this year the performance seems to have fallen off a cliff. I often get build times of over 10 minutes for a single configuration and more importantly it locks up the whole Windows interface for minutes at a time. I have not experienced that behaviour for about 20 years and I’m not even sure how it is possible. Using  Ctrl-Alt-Del to get up Task Manager, does not work. I think I may only get the lockup if doing the build via Simulate Robot Code, but I don’t see how that would be relevant. Is is possible to limit the CPU usage when building C++ code in WPILib?\n\nWe use the shuffleboard pretty heavily (9 tabs with quite a lot of controls set up in code). We have often found it to be a bit flakey, for example some or all values not updating and require one or more restarts to come good, but this year it seems much worse than previously. In particular, we are seeing,\n\nWidgets not appearing at all.\n\nWidgets with numerical values appearing as a Network Table Tree, rather that just as a TextView (this can be fixed by using .WithWidget(), but that was never previously necessary).\n\nHuge latency when updating. For example, a text view and graph showing a value that is zero when disabled is clearly taking around a second to update as the robot is enabled/disabled. This is only occuring with the robot and not in simulation. Driving the robot is not laggy at all.\n\nI would love to hear if anyone has been having similar problems, or has any idea what to do about them. I’m happy to provide more information if that helps. Technical answers are fine. I have built my own copy of the shuffleboard from the source, but debugging the issues myself is probably going to take more time than I have available without some guidance.\n\nI’m also interested if there is a better forum to be asking this question.\n\nBTW Some of the Shuffleboard issues are definitely caused by the fact that it has a huge memory leak if graph widgets are used, but even with no graph widgets we still have strange behaviour.",

See this page for more info Command-Line Interface Reference\n\nThanks! This is a brillant tip. I just tried a clean build with desktop support and for 4 workers the CPU didn’t get to 100% (50-90%). The build time increased from 9m 14s to 12m 2s, which is not too much. I think I’ll also experiment with the --priority option as well. That might be an even better solution as the build should run at 100% CPU, but just not interfere with whatever I’m doing in the foreground.\n\nThe other issue is that the standard WPILib build commands do all configurations, which is usually unnecessary and so just wastes time. I need to spend the time to configure VS Code to easily build just the configurations I need. (When developing code I almost always just use WPILib: Simulate Robot Code because it only builds the one configuration it needs.)",

MSVC could be different, especially in debug mode. I need to know what code to look at specifically because there’s a lot.\n\nI’ve run a few tests of 2024 versus 2025 build times for our code. These are for both my older desktop machine (Windows 10) and somewhat newer laptop (Windows 11), but the relative results are fairly similar. The times are for a build directly after having done a clean , and I rejected times if there was any updating of libraries etc. Note that the for the old machine the code I’m building is actually on a magnetic disk, rather than the C:, which is an SSD (I forgot that in my post above).\n\nThe ‘Full’ build is with desktop support enabled and the ‘Robot’ build is with it disabled. The ‘Desktop’ build is the difference in time between the two, which should roughly be the time taken to build the desktop configurations.\n\nThe differences are smaller than I thought they would be, but as you suggested the difference is much greater for the desktop code build with MSVC, rather than GCC.\n\ni7-6700K CPU @ 4.00GHz, 16GB RAM, Magnetic Disk i7-10750H CPU @2.6GHz , 32GB RAM, SSD Full Robot Desktop Full Robot Desktop WPILib 2024 5:55 2:05 3:50 4:34 1:41 2:53 WPILib 2025 9:14 2:42 6:32 7:43 2:12 5:31 Increase 56% 30% 70% 69% 31% 91%\n\nPersonally, I can live with these times, althought they are not ideal and the effect on students will be greater as they tend to have underpowered, ultralight laptops. I will try to look at our code and see if any optimsation is possible (sometimes optimsation of headers included in headers can help quite a bit).\n\nHowever, there is still the issue of locking up the UI, but at the moment I don’t know exactly what causes that. Possibly it was only happening when I had the Shuffleboard still running and it had used up half my available RAM. @Leyva did report a similar problem above. If you have any ideas/testing for me to try I’m happy to do that, but otherwise I’ll just monitor whether it keeps happening.\n\nI have uploaded the 2024 and 2025 code I was testing with here, in case you wanted it for testing. This happens to be for our 2023 robot.\n\nPublic code. Contribute to TeamKoalafied/public development by creating an account on GitHub.\n\nThanks for your help.",

Maybe try breaking that constant out to a different file and only pulling that in where it’s actually needed?  (Maybe pull out the trapezoid profile as well, but I think that is a lot smaller).\n\nRe: computer lockups, the most common reason for that is thrashing due to OOM.  Reducing Gradle worker count will help (reduces number of simultaneous compiler executions), as will this kind of header change (reducing the memory need for most source files).  The system with 16 GB of RAM and 8 HT is particularly susceptible to OOM.  If each compiler run is taking 1-2 GB, there’s not a lot of headroom if you’re building 8 files at once, especially if Shuffleboard (and vscode, intellisense, Gradle, etc) has already consumed a significant amount.  How much free memory do you see before starting the build?",

Hopefully someone else can take this and go deeper.\n\nCan you possibly describe how you did that? I use Visual Studio every day for work, but it is all C# now. It is over 10 years since I really used C++ for work and there is so much I don’t know. However, from your images it looks like precompile headers are still a thing and that is certainly how problems like this used to be solved for MSVC.\n\ncalcmogul:\n\nEDIT: Now that the PR mentioned below is merged, you can use development artifacts via allwpilib/DevelopmentBuilds.md at main · wpilibsuite/allwpilib · GitHub without having to build allwpilib yourself.\n\nEmbarassingly, I ended up building it myself because I could not understand artifactory. I was expecting to see ‘allwpilib’ with a ‘download’ button next to it. If anyone can point me in the right direction That would be great.\n\nThank for all the work on this. Everyone’s answers have taught me a lot and pointed me in a direction to learn more. I’ll see if I can improve things by organising headers better, and I’ll report back if I have any success.

This is problematic because precompiled uberheaders can take longer to generate and import than just building a translation unit normally.\n\nThe build system machinery for keeping precompiled headers up to date is annoying to maintain.\n\nThe last time we checked allwpilib’s compilation profile, most of WPILib’s compilation time was spent in the backend rather than the frontend, so PCHs wouldn’t speed our build up much.\n\nC++ modules supposedly work better than PCHs, but build system support is incomplete. MSVC’s is complete, but CMake’s is experimental and has some limitations, and Gradle is never supporting modules. Standard library modules from C++23 aren’t supported everywhere yet either.\n\nWe’ve discussed moving to a build system better suited for C++ like CMake or Bazel for 2027, with Java potentially still using Gradle.",
