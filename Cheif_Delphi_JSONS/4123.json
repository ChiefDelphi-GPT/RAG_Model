                    "cooked": "Our scoring mechanism for this year involves a manipulator that pivots on a wrist that moves up and down on a carriage on a slanted cascading elevator. The idea is to have the mechanisms travel to any pre-programmed preset (a preset being wrist angle and elevator height) for different scoring locations and to also have manual control over the mechanisms’ velocities with joysticks (as a backup in teleop). The mechanisms have no-go zones that vary depending on the elevator height/wrist angle. For example, if the elevator is low, the lower limit of the wrist angle changes (to prevent the manipulator from crashing into the chassis), and any wrist angle below that limit is a no-go zone, or if the wrist is angled high, the upper limit of the elevator height changes (to prevent the manipulator from crashing into the upper beam of the elevator), and any elevator height higher than that is a no-go zone. These no-go zones should be respected in both the preset control (have both mechanisms travel simultaneously while making sure a no-go zone is ever encountered), and teleop control (limit actuator motion once the mechanisms are detected to be in a no-go zone). What we are struggling with is figuring out in code if we are in a no-go zone and also how to generate motion profiles for the mechanisms (to reach a preset) that avoid no-go zones.\n\nFor the former, we were thinking about:\n\nSomehow use trig to “project” the manipulator length on the wrist onto the slanted elevator to figure out if the elevator can move up or down without entering a no-go zone, or if the wrist can angle without entering a no-go zone.\n\nMake a lookup table (based on manual measurements) where the x-axis represents elevator height and the y-axis represents a wrist angle limit (can be upper or lower). At certain height values, we figure out the wrist angle limit and enter it in the lookup table. During the match, we can input the elevator height into the table and find the wrist angle limit at that height by linear interpolation in the lookup table.\n\nFor the latter, we were thinking about:\n\nHave both the wrist motion profile and elevator motion profile take the same amount of time, so by the time one mechanism is at its setpoint, the other is also at its setpoint (this might not guarantee a no-go zone while traveling, however).\n\nGenerate trapezoidal motion profiles for both mechanisms and just pause the movement of one mechanism if a no-go zone is encountered.\n\nI also want to add for more context, that both the wrist and elevator are controlled by TalonFX motors, so we can use MotionMagic on preset control.\n\nWe’ve heard there are many ways to solve a problem like this and are hoping to get some suggestions and be guided in the right direction for solving the problem of determining if the mechanisms are in a no-go zone and generating profiles that avoid the no-go zones.",

In formal robotics terms, this would essentially be mapping your mechanisms “configuration space” (2d area), and then identifying the regions of this space which are obstacles (no-go zones). The space that’s left is known as your “free space.”\n\npgutkovi:\n\nHave both the wrist motion profile and elevator motion profile take the same amount of time, so by the time one mechanism is at its setpoint, the other is also at its setpoint (this might not guarantee a no-go zone while traveling, however).\n\nYou can think of this as essentially drawing straight lines through the Cartesian configuration space between your desired set points. And indeed, some of these will cut through obstacle space.\n\nI think the simplest thing would be for you to then manually add intermediate setpoints between these problematic transitions.\n\nEventually this reduces to a graph or finite state machine as others have alluded. You determine a set of setpoints in your configuration space, and then determine transitions/edges between pairs of states which won’t intersect with the obstacle space.\n\nFinally, given any start point and goal point, its a simple path-finding problem to determine the “free-path”.",

In formal robotics terms, this would essentially be mapping your mechanisms “configuration space” (2d area), and then identifying the regions of this space which are obstacles (no-go zones). The space that’s left is known as your “free space.”\n\nWe might also try a trig solution on finding the no-go zones, since it doesn’t seem too difficult with all the WPILib math classes.\n\nbathtubed:\n\nEventually this reduces to a graph or finite state machine as others have alluded. You determine a set of setpoints in your configuration space, and then determine transitions/edges between pairs of states which won’t intersect with the obstacle space.\n\nFinally, given any start point and goal point, its a simple path-finding problem to determine the “free-path”.\n\nJust to clarify, by setpoints do you mean presets? And by pairs of states do you mean elevator height + wrist angle? Is there a psuedo-code example you can give for this strategy, I’m a bit confused on how you would determine transitions between mechanism states.",

Meaning that every position your bot can be in is pre-defied by you. If you do it right, there are no instances in which your robot could interfere with itself like a wrist and lift collision because each movement would be accounted for.\n\nA quick and dirty solution would be to just say every time the lift is between certain encoder values, move the wrist. Not elegant, but would likely work… Could just be a method that runs inside the lift moving command. Would be a simple check I think. I think that’s kinda what you were showing?",

The shaded in areas are the “obstacle space.” The mechanism can’t travel through these so I haven’t drawn lines between them.\n\nThe labeled points are the “presets” you refer to. The mechanism can travel along the straight-lines between presets by using a motion profile on both the wrist and the elevator which has them arrive at the setpoint at the same time while staying at a constant velocity. (The tricky part is if a trapezoidal motion profile is used, they need to have the same acceleration time).\n\nIn the same way these are also states or graph vertices and state-transitions or graph-edges.\n\nTo move along multiple transitions, you just map every pair of start and end states with a “next” state. For example, if the system is at preset A and is commanded to move to D, you have a table that says to command it to preset B. Once it reaches B, it looks up B->D and returns B’. And then B’->D returns D.\n\nI think if you can draw this graph out for your own robot and see where all the collision points between presets would actually exist, it can help to reason about writing a simple controller.",

The vertices are presets and the edges represent “traveling” to presets. I’m not entirely sure what the no-go zones would look like yet, and for now the shapes of the no-go zones are just a guess. I have several questions about this approach though:\n\nbathtubed:\n\nwhich has them arrive at the setpoint at the same time while staying at a constant velocity. (The tricky part is if a trapezoidal motion profile is used, they need to have the same acceleration time).\n\nSo when we travel along an edge to a vertex, both trapezoidal profiles must take the same amount of time, so that by the time the wrist is at its setpoint, so is the elevator? If they didn’t take the same amount of time, the edge wouldn’t be a straight line?\n\nbathtubed:\n\nTo move along multiple transitions, you just map every pair of start and end states with a “next” state. For example, if the system is at preset A and is commanded to move to D, you have a table that says to command it to preset B. Once it reaches B, it looks up B->D and returns B’. And then B’->D returns D.\n\nI didn’t draw this in my graph and I don’t think you did either, but would all the vertices be adjacent to each other, except for the ones where their connecting edge goes through the obstacle zone? Also, what if the current position of the mechanisms isn’t one of these vertices (i.e. after some manual control)? In that case, would the current position be summoned onto the graph somehow, with all possible edges drawn to adjacent vertices (edges that don’t intersect the obstacles), and then from there the shortest path algorithm runs?\n\nI think this approach is very cool, I’m not sure how to code it, however. Would I need to  create a cartesian coordinate space in WPILib with all the presets in it, and with the obstacles created in it somehow? How would I generate a graph in WPILib and what algorithm can be used to find the shortest path between vertex A and vertex B?",

                    "cooked": "That looks great! Most of your assumptions are spot-on.\n\npgutkovi:\n\nIf they didn’t take the same amount of time, the edge wouldn’t be a straight line?\n\nYes, so if they dont take the same time to accelerate and decelerate, the line wouldnt be straight. That is technically fine, but it makes it more difficult to reason about when representing it this way. If you had perfect information about the system, you would just draw the curved lines for exactly how the mechanism would travel between those points, and then you would see if it would collide with no-go or not. Ensuring straight-line travel in configuration space is a little tricky because of the acceleration portion of the trapezoidal profiles for the different systems. If the acceleration is near instantaneous then you just need to move each component at a cruise velocity which has it arrive at the set point at the same time. If it’s spending a good portion of the motion accelerating or decelerating, then you need to make sure they are both accelerating and decelerating in tandem. I think that can be done with some algebra to solve for an acceleration and velocity for both systems that arrives at the goal point in the same time.\n\nAnother approach can be to actually sample the entire motion profile on the rio and stream the setpoints to the krakens. This way you can generate pairs of setpoints for each controller in tandem. This is likely overkill but it does have some advantages.\n\npgutkovi:\n\nI didn’t draw this in my graph and I don’t think you did either, but would all the vertices be adjacent to each other, except for the ones where their connecting edge goes through the obstacle zone?\n\nThey can be, yep. This makes it so you transition between fewer states, which could save time if the mech has to stop at each state normally. An advantage of using the on-board motion profile approach is that you can sample setpoints across multiple transitions for one smooth motion across the graph. Again, likely overkill.\n\npgutkovi:\n\nAlso, what if the current position of the mechanisms isn’t one of these vertices (i.e. after some manual control)?\n\nThis is where things can get complicated. Up until everything we’ve discussed can be calculated offline and encoded in your program statically (the states, their setpoints, the valid transitions). Either calculated by hand or generated at/before compile time.\n\nBut if you want the system to behave properly out of manual control, now you are talking about a dynamic path-planning problem, which the field of robotics has many algorithms and research in this area.\n\nThis page talks about some of those, 5.5. Path Planning — Introduction to Robotics and Perception\n\npgutkovi:\n\nI’m not sure though how to summon an intermediate vertex that will also lead to a short total path length and that’ll also avoid the obstacle.\n\nThat’s the tricky part. In a truly “general” system where you dont know the obstacles ahead of time this is very hard. Since you know the obstacles, you can make assumptions about them and have heuristic methods for choosing intermediate points which always succeed. (i.e., there may be some points in your space which are reachable from all other points, the closest of these could be chosen as a “safe” intermediate).\n\nSo to answer your question, yes there’s a way to generalize this, and it will increase the complexity of your code quite a bit, and it will be much harder to test, but it could be fun\n\nPersonally, I would do the simple thing with static states first. I think if you go from a manually controlled point to not, you could just have it jump to the “nearest” vertex (just on the elevator axis ignoring wrist angle). Based on how you’ve drawn your configuration space, I don’t see that this could ever cause it to drive through the no-go zones.\n\npgutkovi:\n\nWould I need to create a cartesian coordinate space in WPILib with all the presets in it, and with the obstacles created in it somehow? How would I generate a graph in WPILib and what algorithm can be used to find the shortest path between vertex A and vertex B?\n\nWhat I would do to start is have a mapping of states to setpoints first.\n\nThe obstacles don’t need to be represented at all, because you’re deriving the valid state transitions offline (manually or maybe with a cool script).\n\nFor the most part, any state can move directly to a goal state, so what you want to do is encode the transitions that DON’T exist. For that you can map pairs of states (current_state, goal_state) to intermediate states. If the map contains no such mapping for a given pair, then it just uses the goal_state.\n\nIt’s assumed that the chosen intermediate state results in the shortest path to the goal.\n\nAgain, this can be a lot more complex if you try to make it all work dynamically at runtime and don’t make assumptions about your configuration space. I encourage you to research these techniques and learn about them, but would recommend against utilizing them on your roborio in live matches.",

Since you know the obstacles, you can make assumptions about them and have heuristic methods for choosing intermediate points which always succeed. (i.e., there may be some points in your space which are reachable from all other points, the closest of these could be chosen as a “safe” intermediate).\n\nSo the difficulty is figuring out after drawing a straight line if it goes through on obstacle (which would be hard to define in WPILib)? And then if the line goes through the obstacle, I would have to implement some dynamic path finding algorithm to generate an optimal intermediate vertex?\n\nIf we use the heuristic approach, that means we wouldn’t need to know anything about the obstacles in the graph during runtime? To use this heuristic approach, would we generate a bunch of intermediate setpoint vertices along with the preset vertices in our graph script like so (I didn’t draw all edges):\n\nimage 1275×688 46.9 KB\n\nimage 1275×688 46.9 KB\n\nimage 1275×688 46.9 KB\n\nHere all the vertices labeled “I” are intermediate vertices that are accessible from anywhere in the graph by straight line edges (it might not look like that in this drawing though). All the intermediate vertices would be added to the graph and connected to all possible adjacent vertices, and whenever we want to go to a preset (after some manual control), the algorithm would find the closest “I” vertex to the current position vertex, and from there follow the vertex mapping to the preset vertex? Would the vertex mapping be chaotic with too many intermediate vertices?",

You likely don’t even need that many.\n\npgutkovi:\n\nWould the vertex mapping be chaotic with too many intermediate vertices?\n\nNo, because the only transitions you need to specify are the ones that need to take extra steps to avoid obstacles. By default, and preset you command can just be moved to directly. Only when a transition which would move through a no-go zone is requested do you need to supply an intermediate setpoint.\n\nThat’s why I suggested that all the “safe” presets you add for exiting manual control have line of sight to all other presets.",

Our solution to it is to create states like a graph and use MST(minimum cost spanning tree) algos to generate the commands that need to be executed when moving around states. The collision function makes this overcomplicated. Eventually, you will need your own PathPlanner for arm, RRT algo solver, and algo to optimize the generated tree, and network communication(unless you’re using Python or have time to compile network tables yourself and import a bunch of headers) from orangePI or RPI to robotic because it requires too much compute. Also, doing it with a map will cost too much time for the programmer, one way is to approximate circles to fit the wrist and use a rotation matrix to rotate the point while the wrist rotates, collision detection for the circle will be really easy, just detect if dist larger than the sum of two radius. Also, approximate field elements with a circle.",
