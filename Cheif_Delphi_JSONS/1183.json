                    "cooked": "As the title says. Briefly, after switching from MotionMagicVelocity MotionMagicVoltage requests to MotionMagicExpoVelocity MotionMagicExpoVoltage requests and a bit of PID tuning help from 1678 and 254, our elevator performed extremely well (as expected from the request’s reference).\n\nHowever, afterwards, it started to be noticably slower than before on the way up and at a completely linear speed on the way down. This resembled an earlier problem we had while using MotionMagicVelocity MotionMagicVoltage requests and was briefly fixed when we switched to MotionMagicExpoVelocity MotionMagicExpoVoltage and retuned the elevator. This is most prevalent when running from the maximum height to minimum height. Allegedly, this new occurrence of this issue appeared after we had issues on the RIO CANbus, which the elevator’s motors are on. We are running the elevator with two motors. The right motor is a follower of the left motor. Here are some graphs of some measurements from CTRE ’s hoot logs when running the elevator from max height to minimum height to better understand:\n\nProperly functional healthy_cycle_2 1612×1034 98.6 KB\n\nhealthy_cycle_2 1612×1034 98.6 KB\n\nhealthy_cycle_2 1612×1034 98.6 KB\n\nCurrent behavior suspicious_CADA_hoot_log_3-15_17-28-16 1612×1031 98.4 KB\n\nsuspicious_CADA_hoot_log_3-15_17-28-16 1612×1031 98.4 KB\n\nsuspicious_CADA_hoot_log_3-15_17-28-16 1612×1031 98.4 KB\n\nI note that the measured stator current is significantly higher now than when it functioned. I don’t know exactly what stator current represents here, though, since it doesn’t seem to match up with the stator current limit on those motors of 80A, and the second motor has negative current when it functioned.\n\nAdditionally, on testing, the elevator seems to go slower upwards and slightly faster downwards when decreasing MotionMagicExpo kA and when increasing the motor’s kP through Phoenix Tuner X. Our elevator’s kG also went from about 0.45 to over 1.2 without movement. We have made a few code changes between when it worked and when it didn’t, but none should have affected elevator movement, and deploying older code that was what we had at the time did not fix this issue.\n\nHere’s a link to the branch we’re using: GitHub - TeamVortechs/3257-COMP-ROBOT-3257-2025-Reefscape at Pre-SacramentoComp-Branch\n\nThat’s all I have on this issue. Thanks for helping.\n\n(EDIT: We use MotionMagicVoltage, not Velocity.)",

The alleged resurfacing of the issue was when the RIO CANbus connection came loose during a match, which has since been fixed. From when we had the elevator working properly, the elevator was tuned by\n\nzeroing out all feedfoward/back constants in Phoenix Tuner X and the Motion Magic velocity/acceleration/jerk restrictions, then\n\nfinding the low/high range of kG that kept the elevator still, then\n\nusing the average of the range as our kG before\n\nmoving onto using the default kV value and using the MotionMagicExpoVoltage request through Phoenix Tuner X After this, the elevator worked extremely well already. We further increased kV by 0.02 (0.12 → 0.14) and added a small kP (0.35) arbitrarily. After again testing the efficacy of these values, we set these values into preferences. These numbers were kept the same when the elevator had this issue again. While moving the elevator (not moving the robot), the battery starts at 12 volts and linearly decreases from 11.6 to 11.25 on ascent and is about a constant 11.35 on descent (see graph; bold yellow line represents voltage with scale on left; elevator height represented by thin purple line) image 1611×1032 110 KB\n\nimage 1611×1032 110 KB\n\nimage 1611×1032 110 KB\n\nI do not know the gearing and mass of the elevator.",
