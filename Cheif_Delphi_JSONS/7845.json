I have a few questions below that I’d appreciate some feedback on before we go through with the purchase.\n\nDoes anybody have enough experience with this machine to help give me some justification talking points to my school admins?\n\nMy students are pretty fluent in Fusion 360. Is this enough CAD skill for them to be able to use this CNC?\n\nNone of us (myself included) have any experience whatsoever with CNC machining, how difficult is it to learn?\n\nHave you encountered any issues with this machine that were difficult, or expensive, to fix? How common are these issues?\n\nWhich accessories do I need to purchase with this machine that do not come with the machine itself? Links appreciated!\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this post!!",

We were previously an X-Carve team so for years our materials were limited to plastics.\n\nThe learning curve was a bit steep and we broke many bits along the way. I recommend getting good clamps and the tube stock jig when it is available. Get some sheets of plywood or MDF for a spoilboard and plan for stuff to cut into it from learning and misjudging depth.\n\nOne issue we have had is getting a good post processor for fusion. Eventually the ArtFusion Mach 3 works well as long as we always start on line 6 of the GCode and we are at our 0 position. We also have to remove some lines from the end that try and make it go up or home which can damage a part. We usually power it off and back it out by the hand knobs on the motor so it can stop at the original stock point or where the operation ended.\n\nIt is worth the investment in a decent pump, dust shoe and an enclosure if you can make it happen.",

We do our designing in OnShape, and use 360 for the CAM functionality - but 360 can do everything OnShape can do in designing a part.  The collaboration features in OnShape are just so much better than what you have in 360, and the compatibility is great - the school gives all the students MacBook Air’s, and I don’t think 360 would do great there, but they can handle OnShape just fine.\n\nWe’re looking forward to OnShape releasing its CAM package, though!\n\nNone of us (myself included) have any experience whatsoever with CNC machining, how difficult is it to learn?\n\nBoth easy and hard.  It’s relatively easy to get things set up and moving, but it’s hard to find the right speeds and feeds you need so you get good parts without breaking bits.  Lots of teams on here have the same machine, so you can get lots of advice to help with that!\n\nHave you encountered any issues with this machine that were difficult, or expensive, to fix? How common are these issues?\n\nNone so far.  We bought ours in 2020, and have used it heavily in every robot since then!\n\nWhich accessories do I need to purchase with this machine that do not come with the machine itself? Links appreciated!\n\nThe Omio X8 & MPC 125 CNC is a powerful CNC router in an accessible tabletop size that has exploded in popularity in the FRC community over the past few years due to its low price and high performance. Typically, teams would need to import their...\n\nPrice: USD 3,999.99\n\nThe Tube Fixture from WCP is awesome.  We do a lot with 1x1 and 2x1 tubing, and this fixture is perfect for holding it down.\n\nWe also built a table for it, strongly based on the one WCP sells.  You’ll need a computer to run it (we’re using an old MacBook Pro with windows installed on it, running out to an old monitor we mounted to the table).\n\nYou’ll also likely want a shop compressor available to blow chips, and it’s really nice to get a mister in place  to help lubricate the cut and keep the bit cool.\n\nYou’ll need to buy bits as well, we’ve done almost everything with a 4mm bit so far ( CNC Machine – Swyft Robotics Shop ), and we got the collet set from that page so we have options for different sized shanks.\n\nYou’ll need spoil board, so if you cut a little too deep on sheet metal/polycarb (which happens quite often!).  We just use some cheap MDF, cut to size.  Replaced every year or two.",
