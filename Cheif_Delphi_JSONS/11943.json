                    "cooked": "Hello! I have this odd obsession with path planning, and I’m wondering how it’s done on an arm in one particular case. Our robot has a shoulder, with a telescope on it, that has a wrist(only pitch) with a grabber on the end. We started the season thinking we could do something similar to A* to map out the trajectory our robot should take, and use some spline to tie those points together and sample it at each time step, similar to the trajectory generation and execution that’s native to wpilib for drivebases. We ended up running short of time and wanted to just get it working, so we opted for a 200 line state machine, not necessarily the most elegant, but it works, and works really well. My curiosity hasn’t stopped though, so overall, I guess I’m wondering how you would motion plan given these kinematics, I have them all worked out, but due to the x and y being dependent on the angle(pitch) of the wrist, I’m confused as to how you can motion plan in this case. From what I understand motion planning for just X and Y for an arm is relatively easy, just some type of spline such as a cubic Hermite spline or even just lerp and then profile it with constraints, easy enough. To add yaw to your trajectory, say from a starting pose of 0 rads to pi/4 rads how do you profile that? From what I understand there is a path planning architecture in which you can sample the inverse kinematics at every time step, which would be easy enough as it’s an analytical solution. Is motion planning just as easy as adding a third dimension, and if so, that doesn’t seem easy LOL, at least not in the typical sense like you would with a Hermitian spline. I’m wondering if someone knows how they do this in industry. Is it possible with an analytical solving method, or is this specifically apt to numeric solvers?",

                    "cooked": "There are two ways to do motion planning for a general robot arm (which includes both linear and rotational joints). Both are accepted and commonly used depending on the application and requirements.\n\nOne method is to plan the path in cartesian space, get a set of (x,y,z) waypoints, build a motion profile (trapezoidal, sinusoidal, etc) connecting those waypoints with straight lines, then use inverse kinematics to convert the position at each timestep of the motion profile into joint angles. This method has the advantage of travelling in a straight path from waypoint to waypoint and being able to set strict velocity/acceleration limits on the end effector. But because it only calculates the joint angles at the end, you have to be careful that it won’t try to reach a point outside of its range, exceed the velocity/acceleration limits for each joint, or hit a singularity and be unable to continue.\n\nThe other method is basically the opposite. You still plan the path in cartesian space and get (x,y,z) waypoints, but you then use the inverse kinematics to convert those waypoints into sets of joint angles. You then build the motion profile separately for each joint from waypoint to waypoint. This basically has the opposite pros/cons as the previous method. Since each joint is profiled individually, you’re only certain that the arm will hit the waypoints, it won’t take a straight line path between them. If there are obstacles or no-go zones in cartesian space, it’s harder to be sure that the arm won’t hit them. And you don’t have control over the velocity/acceleration of the end effector. On the other hand, since you’re profiling each joint individually you do have control over max velocity/acceleration of each joint. And as long as the waypoints are all in the joints’ ranges, you can be sure that the joints will never exceed their ranges along the path.",

Converting from these cartesian coordinates to the joint angles is still done via the inverse kinematics. Depending on the specific configuration, there will be certain cartesian configurations which the inverse kinematics will not let you achieve; this is your workspace now in 6D instead of 3D.\n\nFor the joint-space trajectories, as long as your waypoints are viable you’re guaranteed that the arm will stay in the workspace. But you don’t have control over the end-effector’s orientation between waypoints. For cartesian trajectories, you know that each angle (roll, pitch, yaw) will move linearly between waypoints, same as (x,y,z). But you don’t have control over the joint angles between moves, so the path between two reachable waypoints could try to take the arm through a position/orientation it can’t achieve.\n\nEdit to add: If all you’re interested in is finding the end-effector orientation and not controlling it, you can do that regardless of how many joints your arm has. You would use the inverse kinematics to transform from (x,y,z) to the list of joint angles, then use the forward kinematics to get back (x,y,z) and a full rotation matrix which can be used to find (roll, pitch, yaw). I suggest you look into Denavit-Hartenberg parameters if this is something you’re interested in.",
