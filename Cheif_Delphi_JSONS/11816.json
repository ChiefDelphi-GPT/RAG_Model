                    "cooked": "I would like to teach students how to program a PID turn command for the robot.  We have no difficulty with PID control. We use proportional control and it gets us most of the way, but there are a few concepts we need help with.\n\nContinuous turning through 180 degrees We are having difficulty understanding how to turn a bot to an angle when the angle jumps from 180 to -180. when going from 0 to 180 degrees, we had no issues, we dealt with overshoot with some hackiness, but if we wanted to go from 180 to 0 AND we wanted to go CCW, we became quite confused with how to handle the change from 180 to negative descending values (-180, -170, etc).\n\nCan someone show or explain a simple way to teach this to students with a way to handle the ascending, then descending angles?\n\nCommand is finished As many know, setting a proportional control to move a subsystem is simple if you know how far you are going to be moving, but it gets tricker when you have different distances. Moving 180 degrees is a lot different than moving 10 degrees. The result of a poorly tuned machine means you either don’t have enough power to get there and the command doesn’t finish, or you overshoot the setpoint and the command finishes, but momentum has brought you too far.\n\nCan someone suggest a simple enough approach to this so a command finishes as fast as possible but always has the right rotation?\n\nWe’ve just been working with kP. Woudl adding kI and kD solve this, or is there another trick you employ? (capping max speed and adding enough output to overcome static friction is what we often do)\n\nYour input is much appreciated, thank you!",

IE, your full equation should smell like motor.set(des_rot_vel * kF + pid.calculate())\n\nTune it as close as you can with kF only (P=I=D=0). Then bring in PID that you already have. It … should … be way easier to tune across a wide range of setpoints.\n\nThe underlying theory why this works:\n\nGenerally, for controls good, real-world , you only want to ask your system to do things it’s physically capable of doing.\n\nSnapping the position command from one angle to another is injecting a step input into the system. Step input responses are great for understanding how a closed-loop system actually works, what the impact of various gains are, etc.\n\nHowever, they’re completely unrealistic - your robot has no hope of ever physically moving with a “snap” motion. This can lead to some of the less-than-desirable real world behavior you’re seeing (especially when things like friction start to get thrown in).\n\nRather than relying solely on feedback, create a setup where you know how you want your system to change (realistically). Then, use that setup to calculate how much voltage you guess your motors will need. Get it reasonably close Then and only then, incorporate some sensor data to help you overcome the portions of your guess that were wrong.",
