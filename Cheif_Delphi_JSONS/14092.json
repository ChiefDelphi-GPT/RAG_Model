CIMs get mostly hot in the back. So I printed something up to mount a 5030 12 V fan (computer fan) onto the CIM. Should fit a mini CIM and IDK I heard a NEO too (dont have one) 20220705_1507511 2604×4624 1.36 MB Look inside at the fan 20220705_1508381 4624×2604 2.8 MB With motor\n\n20220705_1507511 2604×4624 1.36 MB\n\n20220705_1507511 2604×4624 1.36 MB\n\n20220705_1508381 4624×2604 2.8 MB\n\n20220705_1508381 4624×2604 2.8 MB\n\nMaterial HIPS (ABS PETG Nylon should work too - PLA probably deforms too easy) Motor at this time mounted with some tabs for press fits.\n\nCooler housing probably can be bolted to something but its probably better to drill then print only the holes needed so  the air goes where its supposed to.\n\nAir blows over back of motor and then is directed forward\n\nI might make a hole in the back somewhere for the wires\n\nCimFan5030.zip (1.1 MB)\n\nFusion file (still using it for this project as I started in fusion) and 3mf to use in the slicer.\n\nAs the motor is pretty heavy and to give more resistance to heat for now walls are 3mm thick.\n\n3050 fans $ 3.95 at Zyltech.com\n\nComments welcome",

Generally, those are current flowing in the motor coils, current being switched in the commutator (replaced by power dissipation in the electronic controller, for brushless motors), and frictional/viscous losses in the bearings.\n\nA brushless motor has its coils on the stator, so the best place to take that heat out is via the frame element that supports the stator core – a NEO has that support on the shaft end of the motor, so that metal mass surrounding the shaft is the most effective place to situate cooling.  The cover of a NEO is not a good place to remove heat, because it is thin metal.\n\nREV engineers can say much more about NEOs.",

                    "cooked": "Some observational notes from a team that ran things hard the last few years:\n\nRichard is right, the NEO is best cooled by focusing on the mount plate.  We swapped to Thrifty 3-motor plates for Championship, and between the 50% more power and the more conductive mounting compared to our TB Mini setup at Electric City our motors barely got above ambient.\n\nAdditional NEO note: the can is a different diameter, and it tapers off toward the rear ever so slightly.  Expect to massage the model if you run this style of cooler on it.\n\nIf I remember correctly, the CIM gets hottest around the brushes in the tail of the motor.  So the rear bias of your CIM setup is on target (unless I’m wrong about the motor’s architecture).\n\nI’m high on blowing ambient air at things that get toasty, for that outside chance that the air duster technique cracks something from thermal shock.  We were using air dusters and a clip-on fan during Electric City playoffs, and I was personally operating the duster because we didn’t know the limits of the NEO motor there.  (If we killed a drive motor, it was surely call-a-backup territory. I didn’t want that on a kid’s soul.)  For Championship, we bought two more clip-on fans for motors (which we didn’t end up needing with the new configuration) and saved the canned air for the main breaker which is known to handle that abuse.\n\nmpirringer:\n\nMaybe somewhen in the future if/when I get a neo … well maybe I integrate fan blades in the gear that gets mounted to the output shaft\n\nClever, but stick with the concept you just shared.  Motors make the most heat under load, and when the motor is stopped or slow you’re now not kicking any air around.  An external fan can keep working even when you take a stretch break, or you’re waiting for the field to go green after  match, or any other scenario like that. (This is also why you run fans on a custom circuit rather than off the output of the motor controller.)",
