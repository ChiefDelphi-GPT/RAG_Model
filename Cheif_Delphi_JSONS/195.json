                    "cooked": "Hi Chief Delphi community,\n\nWe are working on our 2025 offseason robot using a swerve drive with YAGSL and are encountering a puzzling issue with a single module’s steering motor. We’ve gone through the documentation and checked the usual suspects, but we’re stuck and would appreciate any insights.\n\nOur Setup:\n\nWPIlib: 2025\n\nLibrary: YAGSL (using the latest release version from the example project)\n\nModules: SDS MK4i L2\n\nSteering Motors: NEO\n\nDrive Motors: NEO\n\nAbsolute Encoders: CANcoder\n\nGyro: PIGEON 2.0\n\nThe Problem:\n\nThe steering motor on our front-left module often fails to reach its commanded angle.\n\nImportant Context: All of our testing has been done with the robot on a lift, so the wheels are not touching the ground and are free-spinning. But the problem persists even when on the ground\n\nHere are the key symptoms:\n\nFailure to Correct: The CANcoder is reading the module’s angle correctly, so the software knows it’s not at the desired setpoint. However, the steering motor doesn’t seem to apply the necessary power to correct its position when the drive motors are also active.\n\nFailure to Correct: The CANcoder is reading the module’s angle correctly, so the software knows it’s not at the desired setpoint. However, the steering motor doesn’t seem to apply the necessary power to correct its position when the drive motors are also active.\n\nIsolated Issue: This problem is isolated only to the front-left module. The other three modules work perfectly, tracking their angles precisely with the same PID and configuration settings. This leads us to believe it’s likely not a problem with our steering PID tuning.\n\nIsolated Issue: This problem is isolated only to the front-left module.

With setModuleEncoderAutoSynchronize turned off , we do the following:\n\nActively Seeks Incorrect Position: This is the most telling behavior. With setModuleEncoderAutoSynchronize turned off , we do the following:\n\nRun the robot, then disable it. We can see in AdvantageScope that the front-left module is at an incorrect angle compared to its setpoint.\n\nWhile the robot is disabled, we manually rotate the wheel by hand to the correct angle, aligning the “actual” and “setpoint” plots in AdvantageScope.\n\nThe moment we re-enable the robot , the module’s steering motor immediately drives itself back to the previous incorrect angle . It actively fights to return to a known-wrong position.\n\nThe setModuleEncoderAutoSynchronize Clue: This is the most interesting behavior we’ve observed. When we enable the setModuleEncoderAutoSynchronize(true) feature in the YAGSL swervesubsystem file, the problematic module perfectly corrects itself to the proper heading as soon as the robot is enabled and stationary. However, the moment we start sending drive commands to spin the wheels , the issue returns, and the module’s steering once again fails to keep up.\n\nWhat We’ve Already Checked:\n\nConfiguration: We have triple-checked our YAGSL JSON files. CAN IDs, motor inversions, and CANcoder offsets are all verified and appear to be correct.\n\nWiring: We have inspected all CAN and power wiring for the module. Everything is secure, and we don’t see any obvious signs of a loose connection. The CAN bus seems healthy.\n\nMechanical: We’ve checked for any potential mechanical binding. The module rotates smoothly by hand and feels identical to the other modules.\n\nCodebase: We are using a fresh clone of the latest YAGSL example project, with only our configuration files modified.\n\nWe have two videos that demonstrate the issue clearly. The first shows the module failing to track while the drive wheels are spinning, and the second shows how it correctly aligns itself when stationary while setModuleEncoderAutoSynchronize is on true.\n\nVideo 1 (Main Problem):\n\nVideo 2 (setModuleEncoderAutoSynchronize is true):\n\nHas anyone experienced an issue like this before, where a single module’s steering fails to reach its commanded angle (even with no ground contact) ? Could this point to a failing motor/controller, an electrical noise issue on the CAN bus that only appears when the drive motors are active, or something else we’re overlooking?\n\nAny advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance!",

This means that if there is NOTHING DIFFERENT (except absolute encoder ID, offsets, motor ids) in that modules config its likely a hardware problem.\n\nWorst case scenario you swap out that entire module. So i would HEAVILY scrutinize how that module was assembled, did you use the right pinion gear for the turning motor on that module? (Very common problem) Is the motor getting hot? Is there a loose screw in the bevel gear, etc.\n\nLastly i an sorry that this is happening but I sincerely applaud your problem solving skills that you have applied while trying to fix it!",

It’s truly motivating to hear that from you, especially since I have a great deal of admiration for your work on YAGSL . YAGSL has made my life much easier and I will probably continue using YAGSL until all my products are CTRE products.\n\nMy goal was to explain the problem as clearly as possible because I believe that’s what’s best for everyone. I don’t want to waste the time of someone who is kind enough to offer their help.\n\nI’m almost certain our configuration is correct, so I completely agree with your suggestion. My first action when I get to our workshop will be to scrutinize the hardware of that specific module. It was assembled by another part of the team, so it’s possible a small mistake was made. I will give an update here after a detailed inspection.\n\nThe symptom that still puzzles me the most is the one I described in point #2: when the robot is disabled and I manually turn the wheel to the correct setpoint (verified in AdvantageScope), it immediately snaps back to the previous incorrect angle the moment I re-enable it. And also the setModuleEncoderAutoSynchronize feature can temporarily “fix” it when stationary.\n\nThis leads me to believe there’s a discrepancy between the motor’s integrated encoder and the CANcoder. This brings up a clarifying question for me:\n\nWhen a drive command is issued, does the steering logic use the motor’s integrated encoder or the absolute CANcoder to calculate its target?\n\nUnderstanding this might help me pinpoint where the conflicting information is coming from.\n\nAgain, thank you for your time and guidance!",

                    "cooked": "Hi @nstrike and @Austin_Plummer ,\n\nThank you both again for the excellent suggestions. I was finally able to get to our workshop today to do some detailed testing based on your advice.\n\nTo give the result upfront: the problem still exists, but your guidance helped me uncover and confirm a key symptom.\n\nHere’s a summary of what I found:\n\nnstrike:\n\nVery easy to check. Just open up AdvantageScope and turn the module 360 after the encoders have been synchronized.\n\n1. Encoder Discrepancy Test (as suggested by nstrike): This was the most revealing test. After synchronizing the encoders, I manually rotated the problematic module a full 360 degrees while watching the data in AdvantageScope. I can confirm that the motor’s integrated encoder and the absolute CANcoder values are drifting apart.\n\nAfter one full rotation, a discrepancy of about 5-15 degrees appears between the two encoders.\n\nThis error is cumulative; the gap widens with each subsequent rotation.\n\nThis is also visually clear in the AdvantageScope swerve view: after a rotation, the blue (measured state) module no longer aligns with the red (desired state) module, even when the desired state is stationary.\n\nAustin_Plummer:\n\nWe had an issue similar to this where the steer motor pinion was slipping on the motor shaft.\n\n2. Mechanical Inspection: Following the advice about a slipping pinion, I disassembled the module (while it was still on the chassis, I took apart the components except for the large bearing) and inspected the mechanics.\n\nThe steering motor pinion is the correct 14T and felt very secure on the motor shaft.\n\nThe gear it meshes with is the correct 50T .\n\nThe pulleys and belt also seemed to be in good condition with no visible issues. To be honest, my mechanical expertise is limited, but I could not see anything that looked obviously abnormal or loose. After I reassembled everything, the problem persisted.\n\n3. Hardware Swaps: To further isolate the issue, I tried swapping components:\n\nI replaced the CANcoder with a brand new one. The problem remained.\n\nI swapped the steering motor with the drive motor on that same module. Since the SPARK MAX controllers are attached to the motors, this effectively swapped the controllers as well. The problem still remained with the steering function.\n\nAt this point, I’m running out of ideas. I am very confident it is not a software configuration issue, given the problem is isolated to this specific module and the configs are correct. It seems to be a very elusive hardware problem.\n\nHere is what I am planning to try next, and I would love your input:\n\nSoftware Re-mapping: My next step is to change the robot’s “front” in software, effectively making the current “front-left” module the “back-right” module. This is just to rule out any bizarre location-dependent software bug.\n\nFull Module Swap: If that doesn’t work, I will physically swap the entire problematic module with another module from the chassis. As strange as it sounds, this feels like the ultimate test to confirm if the fault is within the module itself.\n\nI also have a few specific questions:\n\nCANcoder Magnet Mounting: When I replaced the CANcoder, I just press-fit the new magnet. Is there a best practice for this? Would you recommend using a retaining compound like Loctite, or is that not advised?\n\nMK4 vs. MK4i Parts: We don’t have a spare MK4i module, but we do have older MK4 modules (both are L2 gear ratio). Are there any specific gears, bearings, or other mechanical parts that are compatible between the MK4 and MK4i that I could try swapping for testing?\n\nSpecific Part to Order: We likely can’t order a whole new module right now. Based on the encoder drift symptom, is there a specific component (e.g., a particular bearing that could be failing, the top bevel gear, etc.) you would suspect above others? If so, we could consider ordering just that specific part.\n\nI am open to any other theories or suggestions you might have. Thank you again for your invaluable help in debugging this.",

During one of our competitions with our mk4i modules, we had issues with our swerves. We found that they didn’t have any Loctite on the magnets, and the magnets were slowly rotating, making the CANcoder drift. We put Loctite on all of the modules, and the issue was fixed.\n\nI believe the assembly guide recommends Loctite for the magnet, though I might be wrong.\n\nBy the way, I seriously appreciate how detailed your replies are!",
