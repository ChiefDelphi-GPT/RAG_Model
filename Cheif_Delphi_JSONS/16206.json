That is legal as far as I understand. That should enable much more control over the bus traffic, and I could then use it to show what becomes possible with some more control over the bus.\n\nSo… this Austin Schuh guy at least seems to think it is a big deal (or can be).\n\nWhat do others have to say on the matter?\n\nFor my own selfish reasons (relating to trying to control my favorite flavor of diff swerve ), I am particularly interested CAN issue arising when trying to implement LQR control with Falcon 500s (in current control mode). Oh, and there are CANcoders in the sensor mix.\n\nAssuming CAD delays (or rather non deterministic delays) are indeed an impediment to implementing the best version of a well behaved robot, what are our options? Do we just add a CPU to tame the CAN delay problem and leave the rest of the control code running on the RoboRIO? Do we throw up our hands, and move the entire control code over to a Co-processor (save for the required enable signal from the RoboRIO)?  Is there another option behind Door 3 ?\n\nDiscuss.\n\nDr. Joe J.",

How much they get reduced depends on how fast/far the system can move within the measurement delay duration.\n\nHere’s an excerpt from my book that talks about how to do this rigorously. lqr-latency-comp.pdf (330.2 KB)\n\nThe Python scripts that generated the plots are here if you want to play with them.\n\nThe paper discusses things in more detail, but a major downside of latency compensation is if your system accelerates too fast, the optimal feedback gains may be no feedback gains at all (i.e., feedforward only). This naturally has robustness issues.\n\nWPILib implements this algorithm in the LinearQuadraticRegulator class for Java and C++ . SysId uses it to compensate for encoder filtering delays in on-motor-controller feedback.",

It might be possible for the motor controller firmware to synchronize transmits based on periodic messages from the Rio (and avoid collisions e.g. with a settable offset time), but I don’t believe they do this at present.",

There’s only one CANbus (for controlling motors), so adding a coprocessor wouldn’t help collision-related issues.\n\nR57. ROBOTS must be controlled via one (1) programmable National Instruments roboRIO (P/N: am3000), with image version FRC_roboRIO_2020_v10 or later.\n\nThere are no rules that prohibit co-processors, provided commands originate from the roboRIO to enable and disable all power regulating devices . This includes motor controllers legally wired to the CAN -bus.\n\n[Emphasis mine] It seems that co-processors could manage the inputs (presumably direct DIO inputs) and send throttle setpoints to the motor controllers, as long as the enable and disable signals are from the RIO.  I’m not sure how this can be a readily inspectable item unless there are a small set of approved “well behaving” co-processors.  Another possibility might be that this co-processor would send the setpoints to the RIO over, say I²C.  As another alternative, this co-processor could tell the motor controllers what to do by emulating a sensor, taking the sensor data and feedback completely off CAN .",

However, CANbus is by nature nondeterministic: higher-priority messages will preempt lower-priority ones (priority is defined by the arbitration ID, which is divided up into several different fields in “FRC-CAN” ( FRC CAN Device Specifications — FIRST Robotics Competition documentation )). The arbitration, and possible retransmit attempts, happens at a low level in a CAN controller (an IP block in the FPGA, in the case of the RIO), and typically isn’t very accessible from software.\n\nI’ve contemplated the possibility of including some type of reduced timestamp in CAN frames, so that latency could be known and corrected for, but there are at least two problems with that:\n\nAny such scheme would have to be implemented in the motor controller firmware. It’s not a DIY solution.\n\nYou only have 8 bytes per frame to play with, so you sacrifice quite a bit of payload throughput even with only 16-bit timestamps.",

It is on my list hopefully this beta test season to hook up a RIO to one of my test rigs with a nice RT kernel and a PCIe CAN card and see how well we can tune things up.\n\nFrom a system point of view, I’d really like everything to happen at a repeatable, designed cadence.  That fits the controls math best. The easiest way to do that is to set the commands up to be periodic and consistent.  Something like:\n\nsend current command for motor 0.\n\nsend current command for motor 1.\n\nsend current command for motor 2.\n\n…\n\n(optional, would need protocol extension) send “flush” packet to have all controllers pick up the updates and queue data to be sent\n\nget current amps for motor 0 (and potentially encoder reading or whatever else you need)\n\nget current amps for motor 1 (and potentially encoder reading or whatever else you need)\n\nget current amps for motor 2 (and potentially encoder reading or whatever else you need)\n\n…\n\ndo snazzy controls calcs, let other CAN traffic happen, wait and start the cycle over.\n\nThat way the same thing happens every cycle and the timing can be consistent (within 1 CAN packet if something else is happening when this all kicks off).  1 CAN packet at 1 mbps is ~100 uS, which is 2% error on a 5ms loop.  ie, not bad at all!  This adds 1 cycle of delay (5ms), but that is well understood and model-able and controllable.  That requires the other bus traffic to be lower CAN priority though which the current CAN ID bit allocation has challenges with.\n\nAs @calcmogul points out, you can always slow your controller down, but we should be able to do better\n\nDo you happen to know off the top of your head if there are any other threads involved with sending or receiving CAN data that would need prioritization to get to some sort of repeatable, periodic loop?",

If you made a breakout board to read the signals from the Neo encoder before they go into the Spark Max, you wouldn’t have to rely on the CAN timing to get that information. Either feed that directly to the Rio, or make a nice little PCB with a microcontroller that feeds that data to the Rio any way you want (maybe use CAN with a timestamp, or a different digital bus).\n\nJust a thought. This obviously is not as clean of a wiring/programming solution as all CAN, but it could give you better control.",

We use an RT thread with 0.1 ms of jitter and a 5 ms sample period. We avoid using encoder data from asynchronous CAN status frames (as opposed to blocking on status frame receive, which idk how to do) for feedback because compensating for variable measurement delay from 0 ms to 20 ms (the nominal status frame period) would be annoying. If I recall correctly, the CAN layer provides timestamps, but it’s not exposed through the HAL.\n\nWe use the NEO hall effect encoder on our climber, which is sent via a CAN status frame, for soft limits because we don’t care about determinism for that.\n\nLexeo:\n\nAlso, has anyone tried to read the encoder off of the Neo (without disrupting the signal going to the Spark Max)?\n\nYou could, but keep in mind it’ll be noisy. The Spark Max applies a large amount of unconfigurable filtering, so you’ll likely have to do the same thing if you just splice the wires and read them yourself.\n\n3512 attempted on-motor-controller feedback with the NEO hall effect encoder on our flywheel, but the internal filtering added too much lag to hit tight recovery tolerances. It has a 64-tap moving average sampled every 1 ms, so that gives (64 - 1) / 2 = 31.5 ms of delay. Non-oscillatory gains had 1-2 s recovery times compared to 150 ms for our RIO encoder setup. Measurement delay matters less for systems that accelerate slower like drivetrains, but it’s still not great.\n\nWe never tried a separate quadrature encoder plugged into the Spark Max data port (which does have configurable filtering) because alternate encoder support wasn’t implemented at the time (January 2020).",

I really appreciate that everyone helping me to work through this.\n\nI am reasonably committed to using the Falcons so you are making me sad if I can’t use the Falcon internal encoders and (I assume) its current sensors either if I want to use them for feedback in a system that aspires to a 5ms loop time.\n\nCANcoders are in the same bucket then…\n\nNot the best news I could have expected.\n\nTrying to see what I can salvage. Suppose that CAN outputs are ok enough (based on 3251’s experience) then we could use the Falcons in current mode. If I rolled my own, non-CAN encoders and current sensing, do you think we could build a reliable State Space controller with a 5ms loop time?",

This is when the falling edge of all the PWM pulses go out.  NI graciously adjusted the PWM cycle so that the falling edges are aligned rather than the rising edges.  Each motor controller updates it’s output duty cycle on the falling edge, so this means that all the controllers actually update at the same time, and a fixed 5.05ms after the previous output.  We then sleep until 50 uS after that point in time, wake up, sample all our sensors, and do our controls calcs.  We then write the outputs to the FPGA to be picked up when the PWM outputs start again.\n\nt=0 ms falling edge of PWM cycle t=0.05ms schedule wakeup t=0.15ms sample sensors t=1.0ms start control loop calcs t=1.5 ms controls calcs finish t=1.7 ms FPGA registers written with new controls values t=2.45 ms (assuming a 2.6ms PWM pulse) FPGA acts on PWM register value t=5.05 ms start over\n\nThere is a lot of tuning we do to our software to keep these times constant and make sure we always get scheduled promptly.  I’m happy to go into more detail, but there is a fair amount more here.  We are seeing ~150 uS of scheduling jitter.\n\nIf you look at the math behind the Z transform (which is the math that discrete time controls use), it essentially assumes that control loops happen at a fixed, well known, period.  Rather than fight that math, we instead build software to try to meet those guarantees.\n\nI can go into more detail if you have questions.",

Also, running velocity control and/or some type of motion profiling on each motor controller might be useful, in that it allows the RIO to more directly command what it really cares about (velocity of each motor) and delegates part of the problem to the two motor controllers.  I’d guess this will be enough to get good results.  At that point, you could try using a CANcoder if you wanted.\n\nIf things are really hard to manage, it wouldn’t be hard to source something (not FRC legal) with six MOSFET pairs that could drive two brushless motors.  The main issue would probably be the controller F/W development, but you could run the encoder directly into this and do everything there, with very low latency.  If it turned out this was required, perhaps someone would offer such a controller in the FRC ecosystem – but I’ll bet you can get good results without this, particularly with the things you’ve done with the gearing.",
