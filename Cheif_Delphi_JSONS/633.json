                    "cooked": "Hi, I’m Yotam, I’m a mentor for FRC Team 4416 Skynet , and I want to share a cool solution to wiring CANbus we explored this year: using Ethernet cables and custom PCBs to create a parallel CAN bus network .\n\nI’m not an electrical engineer, and we don’t have one on the team. I led our electrical subteam during the 2022 season, but my experience outside of FRC and some physics classes is pretty limited. This is all the result of learning by doing.\n\nElectrical issues—especially CAN signal problems—have plagued us over recent seasons. The 2024 season was the worst offender.\n\nSo when the season ended, we sat down to analyze what went wrong. We unanimously agreed: electrical reliability was our biggest weakness.\n\nIn 2024, our CAN bus was routed with a mix of connectors:\n\n3-pin Dupont\n\nCTRE CAN Connector\n\nWe found the CTRE connectors unreliable (frequent disconnects, even with ferrules), and Dupont connectors were difficult to source here in Israel.\n\nWe brainstormed several possible improvements:\n\nSolder everything — great performance, but horrible for maintenance.\n\nUse better connectors — Powerpole, Molex SL, etc.\n\nSwitch to a parallel CAN bus\n\nUse a different interface entirely\n\nGet good at electronics\n\nWe prototyped the most promising options:\n\nWe knew some teams had done it. So we tried it out—and successfully retrofitted our 2024 robot with parallel CAN wiring.\n\nWe thought: “Why not use Ethernet cables ?” They’re easy to plug/unplug, stay secure, and already use twisted pairs. We cut open a cable, wired it up, and tested CAN signal integrity—and it worked great.\n\nGiven our timeline (~6 months) and past headaches, we chose to combine both ideas: Ethernet cables as CAN connectors Parallel CAN topology\n\nWe designed:\n\nA “Node” PCB that connects CAN to up to 4 devices and transmits via 4 twisted pairs in a Cat5e Ethernet cable\n\nA “Hub” PCB that connects multiple subsystems in parallel and acts as a single CAN chain device\n\nWe were initially unsure if Ethernet cables were legal for transmitting CAN signals.\n\nThe 2024 manual didn’t prohibit it, and we stayed within the spec. In 2025, Team Update #8 made us nervous, but after discussing with others, we all agreed it was allowed.\n\nThat said—inspectors definitely noticed. (Shout out to all the inspectors; we appreciate you. But yeah, it was a little stressful.)\n\nimage 941×639 40 KB image 1920×1440 251 KB\n\nimage 941×639 40 KB\n\nimage 941×639 40 KB\n\nimage 1920×1440 251 KB\n\nimage 1920×1440 251 KB\n\nEach subsystem uses a Node PCB. You can wire all motors in parallel or choose to daisy-chain a few and insulate the rest.\n\nFor example, if you want one motor disconnecting to break the whole subsystem (for safety or logic), only connect the first motor. If you want all motors to survive one failure, connect each in parallel.\n\nimage 201×860 14.3 KB image 1920×2560 330 KB\n\nimage 201×860 14.3 KB\n\nimage 201×860 14.3 KB\n\nimage 1920×2560 330 KB\n\nimage 1920×2560 330 KB\n\nThe hub ties all Node PCBs together. It includes 4 Ethernet ports (1 per subsystem) and two pairs to connect the RIO, PDH , and other CAN devices (like the Pigeon IMU).\n\nOur swerve modules were wired so each module parallel to the rest of the modules so that if a motor disconnectes to module disconnects so the steer or drive wont kill the wheels, while the rest of the swerve will still work (would need to correct its rotational movement drasticly using PID but would work).\n\nFor other subsystems (e.g., elevator, intake), motors were wired in full parallel to avoid single-point failures.\n\nUsually, people recommend keeping CAN stub lengths under 12\", but we ran some stubs over 1.5 meters and had no issues — using shielded cables probably helped.\n\nWe decided on our swerve to connect each module parallel to the rest of the modules so that if a motor disconnectes to module disconnects so the steer or drive wont kill the wheels, while the rest of the swerve will still work (would need to correct its rotational movement drasticly using PID but would work).\n\nGoal: no CAN -related failures at events Reality: zero CAN issues at all three of our 2025 competitions ( ISR #1 , ISR #3 , ISR DCMP )\n\nCAN utilization was ~50–60% with 21 devices (14 motors, 4 CANcoders, 1 Pigeon, 1 PDH , 1 RIO). Not sure if parallel wiring helped or it was just good architecture, but we were very happy with it.\n\nEthernet cables aren’t flexible Our robot was only 52x52 cm, and routing cables in tight spots was a challenge.",

I’m a bit more concerned about your network topology though.\n\nBecause we are dealing with relatively small CAN 2.0 networks this particular wiring, this year, happened to work for you.\n\nAs I understand you: both PDH and Rio with terminating resistors were connected to the hubs and all other devices at various stub lengths to different nodes tied back to the hub.\n\nCAN relies on the placement of the terminations to work reliably (absorbed reflections and improve signal quality). High speed transitions (the signal) cause signal reflections when they reach the END of a stub. A general rule those reflections get worse the longer the stub. Reflections interact constructively and destructively with the original signal and will degrade signal quality (when viewed on an oscilloscope probing different physical length points from a termination), until the signal is unreadable by a device transceiver.\n\nThe issue in your topology is that your bus is very short with both terminations at a single or linked hub, and your devices are far away on long stubs. Both of these are bad topology layout decisions.\n\nBecause we are using lower speed CAN &&& are relatively small (not the size of a car or tractor), the reflections and degradation of the physical signal were not enough that any of your devices found the signal unreadable.\n\nBut because of the topological choice that won’t necessarily be true every year, and you won’t be able to predict when or why it fails…you may add a subsystem and suddenly the whole bus is unusable but you have no mistakes in wiring quality - it’s because the particular stubs and lengths you added, added reflections onto the CAN bus that degraded the signal quality.\n\nYou will also run into trouble the faster the CAN network operates, CAN FD most certainly will throw errors if wired this way - and the new 2027 control system may also have trouble - because you are not following the standards we are unable to tell until you try it…every project every year will be a gamble.\n\nNow the other slice of bread: your focus on the CAN network likely lead to more reliable quality wiring and connection points resulting in your year-over-year improvement and meeting your goal of no can issues (not this particular network topology though).\n\nYou can redesign your network to still use the techniques and materials (Ethernet cables), that made the difference in your build quality and performance this year and get a more predictable and in-spec result year after year on your CAN bus, but it’s going to remove some of what you found as “pros” in the hub and spoke style topology, being able to “choose” to daisy chain some as a logical or “safety” fault behavior, etc …\n\nIn general the bus should look, electrically physically wired, like this:\n\n17456782625066087934180227652098 1132×492 14.8 KB\n\n17456782625066087934180227652098 1132×492 14.8 KB\n\n17456782625066087934180227652098 1132×492 14.8 KB",

We are aware of the potential issues that our CAN system can cause, and we’ll keep those in mind when preparing for the next season.\n\nBefore we committed to this design, we conducted tests on a practice bot using hand-soldered (no PCB connectors) longer wires (over 3m), albeit with fewer CAN devices, to ensure everything would work as expected.\n\nAs you mentioned, it probably won’t work on a CANivore’s CAN -FD or on the new SystemCore. In those cases, we’re less concerned about the parallel CAN bus since we can split different subsystems into separate CAN networks (if I understand correctly).\n\nWe’ll need to conduct some more testing in preparation for next year, focusing on more CAN devices and varying stub lengths to see if we can stay within spec or if everything breaks completely.\n\nAttached below is the wiring diagram for this year’s robot (red crosses are isolated wires - not terminated with a resistor): 4416 2025 Wiring Diagram 1024×1024 228 KB\n\n4416 2025 Wiring Diagram 1024×1024 228 KB\n\n4416 2025 Wiring Diagram 1024×1024 228 KB",

If you re-read my message I explain WHY the topology you have chosen cannot be simply “tested” to make sure it will work and give repeatable results. EVERY bus you build like this will be unique - and behavior will be inconsistent the longer and more nodes you add - perhaps failing SUDDENLY and unpredictably.\n\nIt may even work the first time you build it, then you have an elevator failure or something where a bunch of devices fall off the BUS, but instead of just those nodes going down because of the change in constructive and destructive interference generated by the reflections on the remaining nodes the ENTIRE bus may become unusable - not just the nodes that became disconnected. Thus your thinking this wiring scheme is more redundant/failure resilient proves to not be any better than the standard at all…\n\nHow are you quantifying “staying within spec”? What measurements are you taking to examine signal quality? I fear you may just be taking a resistance reading of the bus looking for ~60Ω, and checking can bus utilization - both of these will reveal not much at all about signal integrity.\n\nNow I AM a fan of the RJ-45 jacks and use of ethernet cable for the CAN bus. I want to sink time into making a standard cable for this, and sensors, to make robot wiring simpler -but its time to invest that I don’t have right now. I think your focus on build QUALITY resulted in your improvement this year but want to be clear for others that the topology (physical and electrical wiring layout), you’ve chosen may be problematic in ways you cannot predict year after year no matter how much testing ahead of time you do. And troubleshooting would require an oscilloscope w/ CAN decrypting capabilities (not likely to be found at a competition), and deep Electrical Engineering knowledge.\n\nIf your team reads up a bit more on CAN and lays out the BUS more like the standard I think you will see similar success as you did this year with a much more reliable and repeatable implementation!",
