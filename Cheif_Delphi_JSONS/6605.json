As a bonus (not mentioned below), because it was released after kickoff, the kickoff release includes the 2024 field image and AprilTag locations!  As announced in other threads, I would expect vendors to make their 2024 initial non-beta releases in the coming week.\n\nPosted 20240106 on 2024 Kickoff Release of WPILib — WPILib\n\nWe are pleased to announce the availability of the 2024 kickoff release (2024.1.1) of WPILib, the official FIRST libraries for robot programming in Java and C++.\n\nThe big news is we are adding Python to our pantheon of WPILib text-based languages–thanks to the efforts of the RobotPy project team, WPILib now has support for Java, C++, and Python!  We’ve also worked with FRC Team 6328, Mechanical Advantage, to bundle their powerful data log analysis tool (AdvantageScope) into the WPILib installer to make it more accessible to teams.\n\nThere have been many additions and new features added by the WPILib development team over the past year. We encourage all teams to read the New for 2024 page in the documentation for all the details! Some statistics (just for the main WPILib repository): 646 commits were made since 2023.4.3 by 45 contributors, touching nearly 3,800 files, with 394,976 added and 137,086 removed lines.\n\nWPILib installation guide\n\nGitHub download page\n\nNote: Minimum system requirements: WPILib requires 64-bit Windows 10 or 11, Ubuntu 22.04, or macOS 12 or higher.  C++ teams should note that Visual Studio 2022 is required for desktop builds.  Mac users will need to have the Xcode Command Line Tools installed before running the installer. This can be done by running xcode-select --install in the Terminal.\n\nWPILib is run by a small team of volunteers and the community. Many of the features and tools included in WPILib started as community projects or ideas. As the new season begins, we challenge you when writing the next exciting project or feature to think about how you can best share your work with the community! Some projects would be great additions to WPILib and we would love the chance to include them. This is also true of any issues you run into using the current library, we are always looking to make things better for teams! We encourage you to talk to us and discuss what you are doing and how it could fit into future plans. You can reach us on GitHub, Discord, and Chief Delphi.\n\nWPILib’s core members are as follows.\n\nAmanda Bessette @ arbessette\n\nRyan Blue @ Ryan_Blue\n\nJonah Bonner @ jonahb55\n\nSam Carlberg @ SamCarlberg\n\nJason Daming @ jdaming\n\nThad House @ Thad_House\n\nPeter Johnson @ Peter_Johnson\n\nPrateek Machiraju @ Prateek_M\n\nBrad Miller @ BradAMiller\n\nJoe Pokorny @ jpokornyiii\n\nJoe Ross @ Joe_Ross\n\nAustin Shalit @ AustinShalit\n\nYotam Shlomi @ starlight220\n\nDalton Smith @ Daltz3\n\nDustin Spicuzza @ virtuald\n\nTyler Veness @ calcmogul\n\nDavid Vo @ auscompgeek\n\nVasista Vovveti @ Vasista\n\nZhiquan Yeo @ zeequeue\n\nWe would also like to call out the translation coordinators for the documentation. These people help make WPILib accessible to teams all around the world.\n\nOfek Ashery (Hebrew)\n\nRegis Bekale (French)\n\nHasan Bilgin (Turkish)\n\nLuca Carvalho (Portuguese)\n\nMiguel Angel de León Adame (Spanish)\n\nJacob Lubecki (Japanese)\n\nBruno Toso (Portuguese)\n\nAtlus Zhang (Chinese)\n\nMin Zhang (Chinese)\n\nMajor past contributors to WPILib include Eli Barnett, Jaci Brunning, Evan Gilgenbach, Alex Henning, Jonathan Leitschuh, James Kuszmaul, Toby Macaluso, Paul Malmsten, Peter Mitrano, Kevin O’Brien, Grant Perkins, Patrick Plenefisch, Fred Silberberg, and Griffin Tabor.\n\nIn addition to these volunteers, many members of the community contribute code, open issues, give ideas, and provide feedback. A huge thanks to these members of the community for their amazing contributions to the library and to the many beta testers this fall.",
