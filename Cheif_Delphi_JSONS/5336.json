Based on what we’ve gotten today, it seems like this game is a heavy attempt to equalize swerve and non-swerve drives by nerfing all the parts of the game swerve is great for (ex. no cross field racing, no real need for robot on robot defense, etc.). My team has been trying to get swerve to work since last year, but we keep running into new issues. We’re considering using Mechanum instead now, but I was wondering if there is any glaring swerve advanatges we are overlooking. Any advice?",

As for swerve, there are some kits you can buy that make it much simpler these days. Not sure if you have already, but give them a look.",

At least with a differential drive, if your mechanisms don’t work well, you can still be picked as a defense 'bot.\n\nOne of Citrus’s golden rules applies here: use a proven (for you) drivetrain.  If you’ve already built a field-oriented mecanum in the recent past and have someone who’s good at driving one, it could work.  Otherwise, it’s probably not a good idea, regardless of the potential benefits.",
