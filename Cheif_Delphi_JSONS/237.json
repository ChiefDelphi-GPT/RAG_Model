However, many mechanisms rely on past solutions, limiting students' ability to grasp fundamental principles. For instance, students often reference previous designs or online resources like FRCDesign.org to tweak models for competitions. This approach doesn't adequately teach the math and physics behind the mechanisms, hindering their application to other ecosystems.  \n\nWe aim to equip students with a strong foundation for non-FIRST environments while competing. Despite running without technical mentors, we struggle to integrate essential engineering concepts into our training. How do your teams ensure students understand the principles of their designs? Can general concepts from introductory classes be incorporated into our workflow?  \n\nThanks in advance for your insights.",

You can’t avoid drive bases being standardized—it’s probably a good thing. But how you’d do odd things with manipulators makes their brains work. Balloons come to mind—get them off the floor and into a tall wastebasket. Grab strings from helium versions near the ceiling and get them into a laundry basket under a table. Of course, the usual perimeter and height restrictions apply. Or pick something else—just make sure the FIRST Robotics Competition hive mind has nothing anywhere close.

Despite the abundance of definitions available when searching for “Engineering Design Process,” most fail to address real-world complexities. The process I employ involves five core steps: Identify, Design, Build, Iterate, and Communicate. Starting with past or other team designs bypasses the critical initial step of thoroughly understanding the problem. \n\nToo often, teams rush directly into generating solutions without adequately addressing the problem itself. Defining the problem is often more challenging than it appears. Similarly, distinguishing between the Design and Build phases lies in planning versus execution. Before initiating physical work, a comprehensive plan must be established.\n\nThe Design phase consists of two phases: brainstorming potential solutions and subsequently evaluating them. Brainstorming allows for considering even unconventional ideas, while evaluation narrows options based on criteria tied to the problem definition. Documentation plays a crucial role throughout this process, with all decisions and changes needing to be justified through a structured Engineering Trade Study.\n\nThis study evaluates options against factors such as time, money, and expertise. Teams must avoid prematurely discarding viable alternatives. Iteration begins with testing, involving both planned experiments and real-world application. Effective testing ensures solutions meet problem requirements rather than mere design aesthetics.\n\nFailing to understand the problem often leads to failed hardware implementations, while rushing into design without planning results in unsuccessful software development. Emphasizing effective practices during the off-season fosters better habits, enabling smoother execution upon kickoff. Prioritizing Identify and Design steps enhances overall efficiency.",

A team lead or mentor can create these challenges, or we can form a Game Design Committee (GDC) within the team to develop a brand new off-season game. It's fascinating to see the world from another perspective, and personal game development can enhance understanding of the Game Manual at Kickoff and improve the Identify step.\n\nBuilding a full FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) or FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) robot during the Off Season is costly and time-consuming. Instead, consider creating a game tailored to the eXperiential Robotics Platform (XRP). The game can be played on a 4’x8’ FIRST Lego League (FLL) Competition Table or a pool table. While you may miss out on Swerve Module experience, practicing the Engineering Design Process can prepare you for future opportunities like hosting a summer camp or organizing a community competition.",
