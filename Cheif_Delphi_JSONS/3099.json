Restart the code again and they come back. Essentially, every other time robot code was restarted or redeployed there would be intermittent overrun errors. This was consistently observed. We are using robotpy 2025.3.1.1, a RIO 2 and a new black radio. I would assume that it is not an issue with our code because it does not change when the robot code is restarted and because there is nothing in the code that is updated every 5 seconds. I can also not think of any physical aspect that would cause this only after every other robot code restart. Any thoughts as to why this might happen would be appreciated.",

Here is the code. The over run errors occur even when the robot is disabled so the code you would want to look at would be in disabled periodic.\n\nself.hardware.update(self.buf, self.time) is defined in robotHAL.py in the class RobotHAL. This is where the most amount of time is taken up based on my profiling though I highly doubt that this code is directly causing this issue.\n\nSome other notes about the code:\n\nThere is a RevMotorController class that I defined that is just a wrapper class for the Rev motor controller interface.  SwerveModuleController is a swerve module class that just bundles two RevMotorController classes together. The only code that I am aware will take a significant amount of time is at lines 529 to 533.\n\nself.motor.configure( self.config, SparkMax.ResetMode.kResetSafeParameters, SparkMax.PersistMode.kNoPersistParameters, )\n\nconfigure() in my experience will cause over run but the if statements it is inside of should never be true without modifying some values.\n\nOne last note about the repo. There are tests for black and mypy. If you end up running tests these will certainly fail on your system without proper configuration so just delete tests/black_test.py and tests/mypy_test.py.\n\nPlease ask if you have any questions about the code.",

Then, make sure everything is at the latest version and see if it reproduces – don’t use robotpy_extras in your pyproject.toml, switch those to use requires and pin them to whatever the latest versions are.\n\nThe initial version of revlib had some CPU related issues, but I think they were simulation only. Make sure you’re on 2025.0.2.\n\nSince this is very deterministic, I think I would try to remove code to figure out which particular thing is causing it. It’s going to either be NetworkTables related (unlikely, but you never know) or something related to querying the hardware (more likely).\n\nOne way that you can isolate whether it’s NT or hardware is causing the issue is by relating your table objects with a mock that doesn’t do anything. If it gets rid of the problem then it’s NT, if it doesn’t then it’s probably related to a hardware query.\n\nThinking about that, in the driver station logs are there corresponding spikes in CAN utilization also?\n\nOn the topic of NT, updating networktables all the time can cause CPU issues – but I would expect that to be a constant problem, not a periodic problem. One way that you can make this slightly more efficient (which matters for Python, less for other languages) is by using network table entries instead of putXXX:",
