                    "cooked": "hey everybody,\n\nteam 100 has been struggling with memory issues recently, and so i’ve been looking into it.\n\nteam 100 is a java team.  there are several different symptoms; sometimes the JRE can’t mmap a chunk of memory; sometimes the error appears somewhere else, like it fails during GC, or it fails during instantiation.  i looked at the VM with JConsole, and didn’t find anything interesting.  one interesting thing about the failure is that it seems to survive deployments: once the roborio is “sick” the only thing that can cure it is a “reset” or power cycle.\n\nOne thing that seems to relate to the problem is the use of non-existent CAN devices, e.g. a motor controller that’s not actually connected.   this produces various error messages (e.g. “CAN frame not received” from CTRE and “CAN output buffer full” from REV).  are these errors perhaps leaking something in C+±land that JConsole can’t see?  are there tools I could use to see the memory in there?  does this sound like a familiar problem to anyone?",

The console output is saved to a file in /var/log, and this is a memory backed filesystem on the Rio.  This is the most likely culprit if you know you have lots of console output.\n\nI have seen memory leaks at times in some of the built-in background processes, including the system web server and NetComm.

It’s like the actual footprint of the process is somehow larger than the RSS, or there’s some other limit being imposed.  Often the memory error occurs during JIT compilation so i tried turning that off, and also tried compiling everything in batch, but it wasn’t any better.\n\nI produced a heap dump (using jmx) and looked at it with VisualVM.  It was both unremarkable and tiny, under 4MB.\n\nLooking at the proc maps (below, edited a bit to stay under the 32k message limit) there sure is a lot of opencv code that i don’t need.  is there an easy way to remove it?  it looks like maybe just kind of inlining and modifying the gradle functions like wpilibJniRelease would work?\n\nAnyway if you’ve read this far, thank you.",

You could try tweaking the GC settings or downgrading to Java 11 (see GitHub - wpilibsuite/GradleRIO: The official gradle plugin for the FIRST Robotics Competition ) but we will likely remove the downgrade option sometime in the future so we can start using Java 17 features in the library.",

As I recall, I had to find the appropriate jstatd for the JVM used. Does anyone have a pointer on where to find the appropriate one for the current JVM?\n\nok. I found the notes on doing getting jstatd running on the roboRIO from 2020, so that I could use visualvm.\n\nUnfortunately, it appears that jstatd is part of the JDK rather than the JRE, and I cannot find JDK 17 for ARM 32 soft float.\n\nHow do people determine where their memory is going now (I used to use visualvm)? The only thing I can think of is to force a heap dump?",
