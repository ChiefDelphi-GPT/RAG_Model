It will have an “episode” every once in a while where the pneumatic system of the robot begins switching on and off every few seconds.\n\nWhen running the self-test on Phoenix Tuner, we found that the sticky fault was in that the compressor current was too low.\n\nWe’ve replaced the pressure switch, the wires to the pressure switch, the compressor, the wires to the compressor, and the entire PCM. The only things we haven’t replaced are the solenoids but if the compressor current is too low then that wouldn’t be the problem. I would expect it to be a wiring problem but we replaced all the wires.\n\nCan anyone offer any advice?",

It will have an “episode” every once in a while where the pneumatic system of the robot begins switching on and off every few seconds.\n\nLet me rework this a little bit to something that makes a bit more sense to me… It’s a bit pedantic, but precision is often required when doing this sort of software+electrical+mechanical system debugging.\n\nYou observe occasional, unexpected compressor stops when the pressure is still low enough that it should be running.\n\nYou simultaneously observe solenoids de-energize when the compressor stops, but do not expect them to be de-energizing at that time.\n\nYou observe sticky faults present simultaneously. “Current too low” would imply some flavor of “open circuit” fault between the PCM and the compressor itself.\n\nCan you confirm the above symptoms accurate down to the details?\n\nWhat I’m looking to try to eek out here is some cause-effect relationships, to move us from “symptom” to “root cause”. A few more questions to help guide that:\n\nHave sticky faults been reset at any point in this process? Since they’re “sticky”, they could have been caused by any problem that occurred between the last reset and now, and therefor wouldn’t necessarily correlate to an issue currently present in your robot’s systems.\n\nCan you describe the symptom in more detail? Like, when you say “switch off”, does that imply that all the lights on the PCM turn off simultaneously? Or, do just some lights go red and others stay on/green?\n\nWhat other devices are connected to the CAN bus? What does the driver station report for CAN bus load? Are there lots of CAN bus faults?\n\nGot software you can post? It’s a bit of a shot in the dark, but sometimes the issues can be spotted by inspection.\n\nGot any pictures of the PCM , compressor, and robot setup? Again, shot in the dark here, but sometimes issues can be spotted on inspection with a fresh set of eyes.",

I would concur, based on the details you provided, it appears to be electrical, and between the PCM and the compressor?\n\nJust to be sure you had it - CTRE’s manual has a pretty detailed description of status light behavior. It does appear that a sticky fault might cause it to lock all solenoids in a disabled state? If I’m reading the tables right?\n\nFor the compressors you tried, any thoughts on their age and trustworthiness? I assume they are legal FRC compressors, and unlikely to both have internal electrical issues?\n\nOne last thing to confirm… I assume PheonixTuner and the PCM’s firmware are all up to date and latest versions?\n\nIt may be worthwhile getting in touch with CTRE as well… they can point to more detailed info about exactly what the current draw thresholds and debouncees are which trigger that fault, which might provide additional hints to root cause?",
