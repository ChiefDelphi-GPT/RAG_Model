It is designed to drive some distance with turns and then when it stops should run our conveyor and launcher systems.\n\nEverything works except that when it finishes the last drive maneuver, the swerve drive wheels continue spinning at a slow speed moving the robot.  This continues until the launcher command is finished.\n\nOur hypothesis is that we are not ending the driving command correctly.  We are looking for suggestions on how to troubleshoot this issue.\n\nA link to our code is here (main): GitHub - YCSRobotics/SwerveBot-2024-Robot: 2024 wpilib robot code",

From the example I gave, we might want to repeat the command (leaving out the logic for actually switching to a new path to follow), we could drive and pick up multiple notes by doing the following:\n\nvar fullAutoCommand = autoCommand.repeatedly().until(() → noMoreNotesToGrab)\n\nwhere noMoreNotesToGrab is some piece of logic defined elsewhere to say your autonomous should be done and stop finding paths to the next note.",
