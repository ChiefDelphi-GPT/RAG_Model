We have a couple of ideas at the moment. 1- a telescoping climb system that is powered by roller springs on the way up and wenches on the way down. We got this idea from a recent comp (Bordie Recharge!!) we went to where 4911 cyber knights and 2910 jack in the bot had these systems. 2- a compact cascade lift system that was common in powerup and deep space. 3- a good pit/robot cart that has tool and battery storage. Any suggestions for other ideas are welcome as well as any help on the ones we have already.",

You can zip disc the top till off a cheap home depot tool box and then rivet it into the corner.  Also worth doing: adding a place to put an old robot battery, and inverter (for powering the laptop), and some fancy LEDs.\n\nWe are going to make some fancy number signs with lots of LEDs and some ESP32s to make them dance.\n\nBTW, on the constant force springs; please stress to your students that they bite!  Its -really- easy to be playing with one, pulling it out, and slip.  This launches the spring along with it’s extended fangy end.  I first saw this with a group of engineers, 20 years ago There was blood and a dent in the wall…",

I find it is very easy for our group to throw out tons of suggestions of things we could do or think we should do, but trying to tackle too many propjects won’t be productive. team78-projectvenn 2334×2550 284 KB This is mainly through the lens of mentors, but I find that it is very important that the mentors are available and excited to support the off season project(s) that you tackle. This Venn diagram is recognizing that you need time/money/focus, mentors excited about possible projects, a subset of those projects overlap between mentors, an aspect of the team you are trying to improve, and then you need to select the intersection of all of those. I would encourage you to at least attempt something like this, because you may realize that your possible suggestions aren’t the best fit for what your team needs.\n\nteam78-projectvenn 2334×2550 284 KB\n\nteam78-projectvenn 2334×2550 284 KB\n\nFor us, we have thought up similar tasks, like telescoping climbers, elevators, outreach robots, etc. but we took a look at what we thought we wanted to improve for our in season ability, and it was really the speed at which we could test concepts and build a mostly working robot. We settled on designing and building two mule wcd chassis (of different wheel sizes), in order to have prototyping platforms ready to go for kickoff, and to have a tried and true chassis template that we could build very quickly after game day (assuming the game does’t require a more extreme chassis design).",

Keep doing that. What most teams fail to realize is that the true skills they need are not in fancy designs, but the ability to pump out designs incredible fast and then make them better.\n\nAlso, if you can’t build an entire drivetrain (mechanical, electrical, and code) in one 5 hour meeting, you’re taking too long building your drivetrain. Practice that as well.\n\nOther Ideas: Practice bots that are always available for programming/drive team to use. Building a drive practice space for robots to be tested (Whether that be permanent or temporary) PR Stands for demos and judging",
