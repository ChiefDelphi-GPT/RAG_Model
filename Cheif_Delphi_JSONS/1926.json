Bought the load tester https://www.harborfreight.com/100-amp-612v-battery-load-tester-61747.html crimped the 3 wires on each cable together into an SB-50, rechecked everything an absurd number of times, even had a ME professor take a look, and on the first test it started emitting smoke about 5 seconds in. Rechecked everything, read through the manual again. Have searched here and there but can’t find any stories of similar problems or why. This usually means there’s something ridiculously simple that we’re missing but we can’t figure it out. Any thoughts?",

Given the nature of load testers, I wouldn’t be shocked to see this kind of thing happen on first use as it burns off residue. My suggestion would be to test it again outside where you have some space for ventilation and in case it catches fire, maybe use an older battery you don’t care about anymore just in case.\n\nIf the issue persists or gets worse while using it according to the directions, I would discard/return it (if they let you) and buy a better quality tester from somewhere else.",

Probably closer to three or four cycles, at least.\n\nCasserole had the same model for a while, used it occasionally.

And they continue to smell like disturbing hot metal.  That resistor gets hot PDQ!\n\nHere’s all the working parts for your delectation…  Tightening up the nuts on the resistor is a smart idea if you DO open it up.  Note that a panel mount SB50 will ONLY fit on the -side-.  Not the bottom, where I tried to install it the first time.  oops.  The meter has a full bridge rectifier on it made with discrete diodes.  There are a couple of surface mount resistors that I don’t think are actually used, and an adjustment pot.  I did not explore the circuit past the point of confirming that you don’t need to pay any attention to + and - on the leads… image 1300×828 133 KB\n\nimage 1300×828 133 KB\n\nimage 1300×828 133 KB",
