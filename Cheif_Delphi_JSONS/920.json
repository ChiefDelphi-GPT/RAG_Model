                    "cooked": "Hello, I’m posting for the first time on here because I am completely lost on why our auton seems to be accumulating error when pathfnding, and then correcting very very suddenly causing it to seem ‘jerky’ which messes us up farther. I am using a pathfindthenfollowpath() method to run autons and even now have been struggling with getting a 1 coral auton working using this method because of the fact that when the auton starts or when the auton switches from pathfnding to the follow path, it jerks very very aggressively and pathplanner records high error compared to the rest of the path (30 cm error compared to 0-2 cm). I was wondering if anyone else also had these issues. I tried to tune our translational and rotational pid controllers to make it better but it didn’t seem to have an effect. I also used to constantly be updating odometry using april tag reading less than 4 meters away and with an ambiguity less than 0.1, but after taking this out the problem seems to persist. Another thing that we tried was various max velocity and max acceleration values but we reached down all the way to 1 m/s for both values and 180 degrees/s for the rotational velocity and rotational acceleration and it still has not fixed the issue. There is nothing like this in teleop drive which constantly updates vision and previously in an attempt to have a teleop auto-lineup for placing using the same concept, although the project was cut quickly, the testing that happened with it did not show any of these same issues. I can also include videos and code for anyone interested or want to help in any way.",

One is a straight line while avoiding obstacles to the starting position of the path, and then the second is a trajectory that interrupts the first trajectory that makes sure the robot heading and angle match with the starting position which usually makes this trajectory look like a curve. And then once those two are complete it lets the manual path run. The “snaps” are happening when we are changing between the 3 different stages and when we initially start the command as well. Here is also what pathplanner defines for pathfinding but I am not sure if this is very useful since it is very short. https://pathplanner.dev/pplib-pathfinding.html Also resetPose() is called when running an auton and the ‘reset odometry at the start of this auton’ button is selected. We are not actually running an auton through the gui so we would have to call it manually if that is what we wanted to do but we do not since we are pathfinding so there is no predefined starting pose anyway. Also there is blending to some extent with the addVisionMeasurement method unless I misunderstood how ctre swerve integrate the kelman filter into this method.",

I mean, is it intentionally placed at an angle, or is it misaligned by mistake? If the starting pose is good and properly aligned, then the issue might be with the PID tuning. Sometimes, even if the robot starts in the right position, improper PID settings (like a high P value or incorrect rotation PID ) can cause overshooting and jerky movement. If the pose is fine, I’d suggest taking a closer look at the PID constants for smoother movement.",

It should be reading our current odometry and then using that as a starting point so since there is not an actual predefined starting pose then there is no way to misalign. As for the PID tuning, there is a good chance it is that but I do not know how I should be tuning it for good movement. I tuned it twice at different velocities and accelerations but still it is acting like this. The way I tuned it is by making a new ProfiledPIDController object from wpilib for two commands, and then for one I made the robot move forward 5 meters and tuned using that while the other command I made the robot spin to 180 degrees and tuned based on that. Is there a separate way I should be tuning for better results?",

                    "cooked": "First, for PID tuning, here’s how it generally works:\n\nStart with P : Set it low initially. A high P value causes overshooting and oscillation.\n\nTune D: Increase D to reduce overshooting and smooth the movement.\n\nAdjust I: If the robot is slow to settle, increase I to correct small accumulated errors, but don’t set it too high to avoid oscillation. It’s best to tune the PID values gradually, testing the robot after each small change. Make sure to test for both translation and rotation separately if you’re using different PID controllers for each.\n\nAs for the snap issue, one possible solution is aligning the robot’s starting position parallel to the reef. This way, the robot will only need to move forward to the reef and won’t have to rotate around itself. It’s a more basic, somewhat primal solution, but it might be a good last resort if other methods aren’t working. This could help stabilize the movement and reduce the snap you’re seeing.",
