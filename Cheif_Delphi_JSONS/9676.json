We’ve got the robot running but every time we turn the robot off or disable we need to realign the wheels. That doesn’t seem right to me and I’m not sure how we would manage that at competitions.\n\nWe’re running SDS MK4i with Neo drives on CAN with Spark Max controllers and a Thriftybot encoder for a steering encoder.  Started with the WPILib example swerve code and modified it to fit our hardware so the code it a bit messy still.\n\nContribute to mallratsftc01/swerve development by creating an account on GitHub.\n\nThanks for looking, Fran 4575 Gemini - Mentor",

What is supposed to happen in this method?\n\nHere’s what I see, line by line: 2) Reset the drive motor encoder to zero, this is fine and not related to your problem. 5) Set encoderOffset to the current position of the turning encoder, in rotations . This only makes sense if the wheel is pointed straight forward. If the wheel is askew, you just set encoderOffset to the wrong value. 6) Converts encoderOffset from rotations to radians . 7) Sets encoderOffset to the difference between a full circle and the current reading. This math does not look right to me, why is this done? I think you just want to invert the value of encoderOffset so it can be added to the encoder reading later. 8) Stores the miscalculated offset in preferences in radians .\n\nThis method also looks wrong. I think it has unit and math errors:\n\nLine 2 sets retVal in rotations , and line 3 convers it to radians . Line 4 Adds the offset (that was miscalculated in resetEncoder() ) and converts it back from radians to rotations . Finally, Line 6 subtracts Pi from retVal , which is in rotations . I cannot explain what this math is trying to accomplish, but it seems wrong. Pi rotations doesn’t seem like it would ever be correct, it makes me think someone was trying to subtract PI radians , but I cannot explain why you would do that either.\n\nIn addition to fixing the math and configuring the offsets properly, my other recommendation is to pick a unit (rotations or radians) and stick with it so you don’t get confused. I also like using Units.rotationsToRadians() and Units.radiansToRotations() instead of doing the math in my code. This helps with clarity, and helps prevent mistakes by using a tested conversion function.",

                    "cooked": "I thought about this for a few minute, and I think I might understand the intention with Preferences . Maybe the intent is that on the first startup of the robot, when no preferences are saved, the offset is configured and saved into preferences. Then, the offset is loaded from preferences on future startups.\n\nThis could work, but you’d have to be certain the wheels are properly aligned and the code offset code is correct on the first startup. It doesn’t allow for any kind of recalibration if a physical change is made (a module is replaced).\n\nHowever, in addition to the math and unit problems above, there are some coding errors to get this to work.\n\nencoderOffset is a instance variable (not scoped to a method). encoderOffset is read from preferences in the constructor, and is defaulted to zero. Everything is OK so far. The problem is in resetEncoder() . Based on the use of initDouble I’m making a guess that the intention here is to only save the offset to preferences if it hasn’t already been configured. The problem with this code is that it sets the encoderOffset variable regardless of whether or not there is a value saved in preferences. I think you probably want to use a local variable for most of the work, and only set the instance variable encoderOffset if there is no preference saved.",

Maybe we can still help OP by guessing what they are trying to do with Preferences.\n\nI think OP has confused what it means to reset the encoder. The statement to zero it sets the angle to 0 in the program and does not effect the physical position of the drive as you point out.\n\nEach time there is some sort of construction activity which moves the encoder body relative to the robot the encoder offset has to be remeasured. This isn’t needed very often but when modules are changed or rebuilt. Before running resetEncoder in order to save the Preference - offset - the wheels have to be straight. We use a jig to carefully aligning the wheels to straight. OP doesn’t want setPosition 0 there, they want the measured angle to save in Preferences - offset.\n\nThen when operating the robot, point the robot wheels in the desired direction that will be the reference 0 for that driving session, subtract the offset from the measured position and call that zero with setPosition. The starting position of the robot doesn’t have to be 0 ; we often use 180 but then the program initializes the setPosition angle to 180 and not 0 . Again we often use a jig to assure straight or lineup to some field element such as a floor line or wall.\n\nOur paths crossed; took me too long to type.",

I’m going to try to respond to everything in this one post, so I’m sure I’ ll miss something.\n\nThe initDouble should have been something that writes every time (we misread how that function worked, thought it was more like insert or update in SQL).  So that’s been changed to setDouble. I need to get a new version up on github.\n\nThe intent of writing to the RIO is to prevent having to hard code values in case something happens and they need to be changed it won’t require a code deploy. We hard coded the offsets and the robot looks like its working now, but I’d still like to have the flexibility of the stored values.\n\nThe resetEncoder method is supposed to only be triggered when the wheels are aligned to a zero position (we either push a long frame part or a 2x4 against the side of 2 wheels until they flatten out on the stick or use a square aligned with the frame (doesn’t work with bumpers on)). Then disconnect the motors (to prevent them from moving the wheels) and turn on the robot.  There’s a 2 button combo that calls the method, hit that and the motors can be plugged in again.  I’m sure there are many far better ways.\n\nencoderOffset is intended to be in radians.  The calculation in resetEncoder is broken down into parts to make it more readable (and supposed to be easier to debug?). We keep using the same variable because its just steps along the way.\n\nWe wanted to avoid negative numbers when applying the offset because java implements % (mod) for negative numbers different from how I expect it to work (-90 % 360 = 90, I expect -90 % 360 = 270). To prevent negative numbers we’ve switched the offset to be an additive value instead off subtractive (did this part of the way through development, so maybe there’s some parts that got missed). So the calculation for the offset has some algebra applied. encoder - offset + 360 would be how to keep the negative numbers away, so just switch the order and get encoder + (360 - offset), we just store what’s in (). I thought encoder offset was scoped to the module.\n\nEncoderValue() line 6 is probably wrong, the pid loop is configured to (-pi, pi) m_turningPIDController.enableContinuousInput(-Math.PI, Math.PI); so it felt like having the encoder return values in the same range made sense.\n\nUnits.rotationsToRadians() and Units.radiansToRotations() will definitely help, and I’ ll get the team working on putting those in there.\n\nFran 4575 Gemini - Mentor",
