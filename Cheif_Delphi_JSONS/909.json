We have two Falcon 500s which are mechanically linked with one as a leader and the other as a follower and are only commanding voltage on the leader motor. This is what voltage looks like when commanding voltage based on joystick input: image 1459×883 74.7 KB (Here the red line represents the joystick input and the motors are being commanded to go 12 times the voltage. We are not hitting either our stator current or our supply current limit. If anybody has any idea what is going on and/or how we could fix it that would be extremely helpful.\n\nimage 1459×883 74.7 KB\n\nimage 1459×883 74.7 KB",
