I think I’m setting it up correctly in terms of size, but it would be nice to hear what other teams have theirs set up with. Like is the X good with travel from -3\" to 31\" ?\n\nI’m also not sure what the set up for the kinematics should be, one video I watched switched the location of the “head” and “table”, but that was an older version of Fusion 360 and there are fewer tabs for setting up in the machine definitions.\n\nI think I’ve got the post processing set up with WinCNC for ShopSabre, but someone correct me if that’s wrong.\n\nIs there a way for someone to just export their set up and I could import that? Searching online has yielded me nothing.\n\nI’ve been trying to learn as much as I can about using a CNC, but it feels like all the resources are for machinists, so as beginner friendly as can be is much appreciated.",

I don’t have a machine file to post for you to import.\n\nI’m not sure how much the axis size settings matter in the Fusion 360 machine setup.  From what I can tell, they are mostly (exclusively?) used for machine simulation in Fusion 360.  If I put a sheet of material on my router and set the X and Y zeros in WinCNC somewhere in the middle of the sheet for where I want to start cutting, Fusion 360 knows nothing of that.  If Fusion 360 had axis limits of my table size, those would not apply if my operating zero was not at the table origin.  If I’m cutting tube in a jig, and my WinCNC Z zero is at the top of the tube, any Fusion 360 Z limits for the machine would no longer apply.  I’d be limited to a Z travel of maybe 2\" for that cut vs the full Z travel capability of the machine of say 6\".\n\nMy suggestion is that you get your rapid and feed max rates set to the specs on your router and put in your machine travel dimensions for the axis limits.  Create your toolpaths and if the toolpath simulation in Fusion 360 looks good and the toolpath preview in WinCNC looks good, you are probably going to be good to go.  It’s going to be up to you to create toolpaths that stay on the table and are within the height limitations of your spindle.  WinCNC should alert you if your toolpath is going to violate physical limits of your machine given the current temporary zeros you have in place on all the axes.",

ShopSabre should have setup that file with the appropriate limits, axis speeds, etc. specifically for your machine, so you should be able to work backwards from the values in that file.\n\nI know you asked for help using Fusion 360, and if you’re committed to going that route then ignore the rest of my post\n\nIf you’re new to CNC machining, then I would recommend using VCarve Pro rather than Fusion 360 to start out. ShopSabre’s YouTube channel has a huge playlist of how-tos and tutorials on running your machine using the “VCarve → WinCNC → Running the machine” workflow. Nothing against Fusion 360, but the amount of support and training material available specifically for your machine with VCarve is invaluable when starting out.\n\nWe have a 15 y/o ShopSabre that we were able to bring to back to life this year with a single phone call to ShopSabre support and then learning from their YouTube channel",

There may be many options to define information about the machine, but they shouldn’t be nessisary for your application. Defining things about the table for example might be needed for a complicated 5 axis operation, but shouldn’t be needed for a router. You just have to make sure yourself that the part you are trying to cut fits in the preview. Worst case scenario you hit a limit switch. Unlike a typical 3D printer, you will often move the origin (not in CAM but at the router itself) on your machine to define where your g-code will start, rather than always using an absolute origin.\n\nJeff_2450:\n\nI’ve been trying to learn as much as I can about using a CNC, but it feels like all the resources are for machinists, so as beginner friendly as can be is much appreciated.\n\nMy senior year I was tasked with learning how to use our new ShopSabre RC4 and it was rough. It’s a steep learning curve at first, but once you make your first few parts, it’s smooth sailing from there.",
