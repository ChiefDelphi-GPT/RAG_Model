Similar to past years—2024, 2023, and 2021—we utilize this thread for posting requests, fixes, new features, and issues encountered with the library or app.  \n\nA public Trello board lists existing open items, though it may appear messy due to ongoing activities during builds and competitions. We aim to streamline it before the 2025 season begins. Before submitting a request, please review the Trello board to ensure it hasn’t already been addressed or is in progress. A future priority list will prioritize features based on usage and demand.  \n\nOur document structure from last year continues to function well; expect only organizational improvements without structural changes.  \n\nOne request is to incorporate subcategories guided by document folders, but our featurescript library lacks the capability to navigate folders accordingly.  \n\nWe’re a small group of alumni and mentors striving to provide support. While we’re exploring student involvement, compliance with the Youth Protection Policy prevents active participation until further notice. For inquiries, DM at least two of the following: @RickyRobot, @Ty_Tremblay, or @AndrewCard.",

If we decide to copy the featurescript you are mentioning, we will break the connection to any updates it would get in the future from the developer who has no connection to MKCAD. We could then add our own features, but I don’t like the idea of making one specific featurescript for our uses at the featurescript level.\n\nIn my opinion, a better option for this would be to insert the gear you want as a featurescript into your part studio and then make any changes you wish to see to it, such as FIRST Robotics Competition-specific bore options, or mounting hole patterns.\n\nWe could do this as a separate configurable part in MKCAD as well, though there are quite a few configuration options available at that point. It is likely not difficult to adjust if needed.",

My request is to sync these automatically or have a more rigorous process to ensure updates are carried through. Another request is that occasionally, it is helpful to derive a component from an assembly into a part studio for modification. This may be a single part or a cluster of parts that should come in as a unit. The MKCad app doesn't allow for parts that only exist in an assembly (like Gearbox Plate) to be easily derived. Lastly, it would be really nice to have the ability to search by vendor and part number in the App.",

Mates describe how these coordinate systems interact, such as being fastened, rotating around the Z axis, or translating along it.\n\nIncluding a checkbox for mate connectors means users can choose to have pre-made connectors available. Unchecking this option removes those connectors from the part/assembly.\n\nHiding mates does not affect whether mate connectors are present.Mate connectors are independent of mates.\n\nUnderstanding the difference between the two helps clarify their roles.

There may be several items intended for inclusion that haven't yet been incorporated due to lack of attention or updates. If anyone notices specific missing components, please notify us so we can consider adding them.\n\nThese components are typically located in a dedicated workspace within the part studio rather than being displayed directly in the MKCAD app. Hiding them helps reduce visual clutter, especially for less experienced users. The best approach to bring in these parts is through the standard Onshape insert interface, which ensures visibility throughout the MKCAD environment.\n\nSearching by vendor name remains straightforward—for instance, TTB (Thrift), AM (AndyMark), or REV. This search method looks only at the document titles, excluding metadata, so parts from different vendors aren't combinable via this route. While exploring solutions for enhancing vendor-based searches is ongoing, this current setup serves its purpose effectively.",

However, the MKCad app has biases toward certain vendors for specific items. For example, configurable bearings are primarily based on Vex products, though this isn't exhaustive. Additionally, there's some redundancy for configurable components that are similar but not identical.\n\nTo import those parts, the best approach would be to use the regular Onshape insert interface, which provides access to everything within MKCAD.\n\nCould there be a power-user checkbox that displays everything? It would save time compared to navigating the backend.\n\nAnother request: Could all wheels of the same OD/hub type be grouped under a single configurable component? Ideally, this could be simplified into a single \"Configurable wheel,\" allowing users to specify the hub style and OD, followed by a list of options.",

Enhancing the search functionality to include these filters would significantly improve usability and streamline the browsing experience.  \n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**  \nA user attempts to locate a resource by entering its part number or selecting a vendor through the application's search interface. Currently, these filters are unavailable, leading to suboptimal search results.  \n\n**Expected Outcome:**  \nUsers will be able to search for resources using both vendor and part number filters, enabling more precise and efficient navigation within the application.  \n\n**Actual Outcome:**  \nAt present, users cannot utilize vendor or part number filters during searches, resulting in less targeted outcomes compared to future enhancements.  \n\n**Environment Details:**  \nThis issue pertains to the application running on web browsers such as Chrome and Firefox across various operating systems including Windows 10, macOS, and Linux.",
