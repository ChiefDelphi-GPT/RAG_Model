In my search, I’ve come across VersaFrame, but it doesn’t have holes drilled on all sides. The reason I’m looking for tube stock specifically with the predrilled holes is that our team decided it would be easier and better suited to build our robot around these holes, both in the design and build phase during the season.\n\nAre these tubes drilled in-house by teams or a sponsor, or can they be bought from a supplier with the holes already drilled?\n\nExamples are posted below. None of these photos are mine\n\nAluminumTube 755×963 351 KB AluminumTube2 1538×747 982 KB\n\nAluminumTube 755×963 351 KB\n\nAluminumTube 755×963 351 KB\n\nAluminumTube2 1538×747 982 KB\n\nAluminumTube2 1538×747 982 KB",

As of today, they have a very lightweight (0.04\" wall) 2x1 tube with a 0.5\" grid pattern available in their MAXtube line. They do not yet have a more substantial 2x1 tube with 0.125\" side walls available.  They have not announced any plans to introduce 2x2, 2x1.5, or other larger sizes of pre-drilled tube.\n\nThe other thing shown in several of your screenshots are gussets, mounting brackets, or major structural parts that have hole patterns compatible with the rectangular tube.  While Rev and a few other suppliers sell some general purpose brackets/gussets , anything custom would have to be made in-house, by a sponsor, or by an FRC -related service or general-purpose service .",

While Rev and a few other suppliers sell some general purpose brackets/gussets , anything custom would have to be made in-house, by a sponsor, or by an FRC -related service or general-purpose service .\n\nLuckily, you’ve got quite a few options on gussets–pretty much everything is on either a 1/2\" hole pitch or occasionally a 1\", and none of the big suppliers make their holes bigger than 10 sized (a few, like VEX and Thrifty Bot, do 8 instead but that’s nothing a drill bit can’t fix).  AndyMark puts 1/4\" holes on a 2\" grid on the AM14Ux chassis as well; enlarge a couple holes on a gusset and it’s easy to add structure going vertical.\n\nThe only exception is someone using AndyMark Peanut or Walnut extrusion, which uses a 5/8\" spacing and 1/4-20 hardware  But with press-in tube connecting nuts becoming widespread for face-mounting to extrusion, I think their relevance to modern FRC robots is diminishing.",
