Here is a summary of the top priorities for things we would like to work on.  No guarantees that all of these will make it for 2025, and we would really appreciate any community assistance!  Please see the roadmap slides below for more detail:\n\nChange the command structure relating to auto and triggers\n\nAdd the ability to optionally clear deploy folders\n\nBring Elastic into the library and update dashboard configuration\n\nImproved vendordep experience.  Improved installer supporting outside tools.\n\nBetter data logging and unified telemetry (Sendable rewrite, telemetry, annotations)\n\nConferences: WPILib Roadmap - Slides Unexplored Features in WPILib - Slides AdvantageScope and AdvantageKit RobotPy: past, present, and future - Slides WPILib Feedback and Open Q&A - This wasn’t recorded and there were no slides.  Thanks to NI, REV, and CTRE for lending their expertise for the panel.\n\nAlso posted on the WPILib Blog",

Here are a few that I’ve been focusing on, and as always, feedback is greatly appreciated.\n\nUsing custom annotations and an annotation processor to generate custom data loggers for user code at compile time. The barrier to entry is about as low as it can feasibly be; just add a @Logged annotation to any class you want to be logged and add Epilogue.bind(this) in robotInit() to start logging to NT.\n\nAdd an annotation-based logging framework for Java programs wpilibsuite:main ← SamCarlberg:annotation-logging opened 05:23PM - 04 May 24 UTC SamCarlberg +5147 -7\n\nAdd an annotation-based logging framework for Java programs wpilibsuite:main ← SamCarlberg:annotation-logging opened 05:23PM - 04 May 24 UTC SamCarlberg +5147 -7\n\nwpilibsuite:main ← SamCarlberg:annotation-logging\n\nopened 05:23PM - 04 May 24 UTC SamCarlberg +5147 -7\n\nopened 05:23PM - 04 May 24 UTC\n\nSamCarlberg\n\n+5147 -7\n\nAn annotation processor will generate data loggers at compile time based on the … contents of the annotated classes.\n\nLogging is opt-out by default; placing an `@Logged` annotation on a class will attempt to log *everything* in that class. This can be configured by setting the strategy on the class and by configuring the importance levels on the logged elements, or by placing a `@NotLogged` annotation on fields and methods that should always be excluded\n\nExplicitly tagging a non-loggable element will result in a compile-time error\n\nData is logged to NetworkTables by default, but can be configured to use any backend (just implement the `DataLogger` interface)\n\n~~This relies on features added between Java 11 and 17, including text blocks and pattern matching, and I've included a small commit that bumps our source compatibility. We already build with and ship JDK 17 to teams, so this is just giving us access to those language features.~~ Added separately in #6585\n\nAn annotation processor will generate data loggers at compile time based on the … contents of the annotated classes.\n\nLogging is opt-out by default; placing an `@Logged` annotation on a class will attempt to log *everything* in that class.

It allows commands to be implemented with a single function instead of needing separate functions for init, loop execution, completion checks, and cleanup. Notably, this can massively simplify dynamic autonomous routines:\n\n(exact naming is still TBD)\n\nThis is a from-scratch reimplementation of commands and also introduces many small improvements like command prioritization, suspend-on-interrupt, and smarter scheduler logic that better tracks composed commands and nested subsystems. Most of those can be backported to the current commands framework, and some (like priorities) are already being added.\n\n[DRAFT] Add async command framework using Java 21 language features wpilibsuite:main ← SamCarlberg:better-async-commands opened 12:41AM - 17 Apr 24 UTC SamCarlberg +5394 -9\n\n[DRAFT] Add async command framework using Java 21 language features wpilibsuite:main ← SamCarlberg:better-async-commands opened 12:41AM - 17 Apr 24 UTC SamCarlberg +5394 -9\n\nwpilibsuite:main ← SamCarlberg:better-async-commands\n\nopened 12:41AM - 17 Apr 24 UTC SamCarlberg +5394 -9\n\nopened 12:41AM - 17 Apr 24 UTC\n\nSamCarlberg\n\n+5394 -9\n\nThere's a lot of WIP code in here that needs to be cleaned up.\n\nI'm opening th … is PR anyway to get eyes on this and start a discussion. The framework fundamentally relies on virtual threads added in Java 21; in addition, parallel command groups rely on the structured concurrency API added as a preview feature in Java 21 (which is also in a second preview in Java 22). Configuring the JVM to use a single carrier thread for all virtual threads in the process means async commands and triggers can be written without needing multithreaded concepts like locks and atomic field access.\n\nThe async framework allows command bodies to be written in an imperative style:\n\n```java\nHardwareResource drivetrain = new Drivetrain();\n\nAsyncCommand driveTenFeet =\n  drivetrain.run(() -> {\n    drivetrain.resetEncoders();\n    while (drivetrain.getDistance() < 10) {\n      AsyncCommand.pause(); // <- note the pause call!\n      drivetrain.tankDrive(1, 1);\n    }\n    drivetrain.stop();\n  }).named(\"Drive Ten Feet\");\n```\n\nWhich would look something like this using the current functional framework:\n\n```java\nSubsystem drivetrain = new Drivetrain();\n\nComand driveTenFeet =\n  drivetrain.runOnce(drivetrain::resetEncoders)\n    .andThen(driveTrain.run(() -> drivetrain.tankDrive(1, 1))\n    .until(() -> drivetrain.getDistance() < 10)\n    .finallyDo(drivetrain::stop)\n    .withName(\"Drive Ten Feet\");\n```\n\nCommands could be written as thin wrappers around regular imperative methods:\n\n```java\nclass Drivetrain extends HardwareResource {\n  void driveDistance(Measure<Distance> distance) {\n    encoders.reset();\n    while (getDistance().lt(distance)) {\n      AsyncCommand.pause();\n      tankDrive(1, 1);\n    }\n    stop();\n  }\n\n  AsyncCommand driveDistanceCommand(Measure<Distance> distance) {\n    return run(() -> driveDistance(distance)).named(\"Drive \" + distance.in(Feet) + \" Feet\");\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHowever, an async command *will* need to be *actively* cooperative and periodically call blocking operations for the virtual thread that executes it to be paused and allow another vthread to be scheduled. This can be accomplished by calling `AsyncCommand.pause()` in every loop run, which just calls `Thread.sleep(20)` under the hood to pause the vthread for 20 milliseconds. Calling `AsyncCommand.pause(Measure)` allows for custom pause times, such as 5 or 10 milliseconds for commands that require tighter loops. \n\nOperations that pause the current thread (such as calling `.get` on a future or acquiring a read/write lock) will allow for a vthread to be parked and another vthread to be continued. `synchronized` blocks and methods do *not* pause the vthread, and will instead block the native *carrier thread*, and thus *all commands and triggers* as well. In addition, virtual threads cannot be paused while executing in native code.\n\nThere are also some other additions like priority levels (as opposed to a blanket yes/no for ignoring incoming commands), factories requiring names be provided for commands, and the scheduler tracking all running commands and not just the highest-level groups. However, those changes aren't unique to an async framework, and could just as easily be used in a traditional command framework.\n\nLinks:\n[JEP 425 - Virtual Threads](https://openjdk.org/jeps/425)\n[JEP 453 - Structured Concurrency](https://openjdk.org/jeps/453)\n[The async version of the rapid react example project](https://github.com/SamCarlberg/allwpilib/tree/better-async-commands/wpilibjExamples/src/main/java/edu/wpi/first/wpilibj/examples/async/)\n[AsyncScheduler.java](https://github.com/SamCarlberg/allwpilib/blob/better-async-commands/wpilibNewCommands/src/main/java/edu/wpi/first/wpilibj3/command/async/AsyncScheduler.java)\n[ParallelGroup.java](https://github.com/SamCarlberg/allwpilib/blob/better-async-commands/wpilibNewCommands/src/main/java/edu/wpi/first/wpilibj3/command/async/ParallelGroup.java)\n[Sequence.java](https://github.com/SamCarlberg/allwpilib/blob/better-async-commands/wpilibNewCommands/src/main/java/edu/wpi/first/wpilibj3/command/async/Sequence.java)\n\nThere's a lot of WIP code in here that needs to be cleaned up.\n\nI'm opening th … is PR anyway to get eyes on this and start a discussion.

                    "cooked": "The main thing is to look at all the things GradleRIO (and deploy-utils ) has to do for deployment:\n\nTarget discovery (both team number driven and getting the target IP from the DS ).  This needs to include checking the image version for Rio targets.\n\nDeployment via SSH of different types of artifacts (e.g. libraries, executables, command scripts, file trees).  Some of these need synchronization type capabilities to avoid unnecessary copies (e.g. checksum both sides and/or grab a checksum file from the target and compare)\n\nRunning commands (also via SSH) to set permissions, etc, including support for arbitrary commands\n\nRunning a detection script (e.g. checking remote JDK version) and running actions depending on the result (e.g. deploying/installing a different JDK)\n\nWriting down what the requirements are and spec’ing out the JSON file and command line arguments should be the first step.  There’s lots of decisionables here; to name a few:\n\nShould the team number be a command line argument, pulled from a local config file, or both (e.g. pulled from a local config file, but can be overridden from the command line)?  What about supporting coprocessors with arbitrary IPs?\n\nShould the JSON only allow pointing to actual files (and any extraction, e.g. from Maven artifacts, be done by the build system), or should the deploy tool have integrated support for downloading and/or extract things before deploy?\n\nIs the JSON file describing a sequence of configurable steps, or more of a functional description (e.g. here’s the libraries, here’s the executables, etc), or some combination of those two things?  For coprocessors, custom steps is great, but for Rio type deploys, we want to minimize the chance of build system errors messing up deploy sequences, so there’s a tension there.",

It allows commands to be implemented with a single function instead of needing separate functions for init, loop execution, completion checks, and cleanup. Notably, this can massively simplify dynamic autonomous routines:\n\nThere’s 2 paradigms I’ve always wanted to see with coroutines in WPILib. The following examples are in no particular language\n\nAwaitable commands or boolean predicates. And the ability to mix old-style and new-style commands. I used await here which python has. C++ has co_await, I’m not sure what Java has.\n\nAsynchronous periodic commands, similar to what you’re already proposing\n\nOn a separate note, would it even be possible to have this with C++20 coroutines. I believe a special compiler flag has to be enabled (-fcoroutines), not sure if the frc compiler has support for that.\n\nI guess you said this is planned for 2027, so we don’t even know what the compiler will be…",
