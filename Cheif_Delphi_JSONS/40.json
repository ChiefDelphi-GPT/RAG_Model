They want the cleaned text to be a single paragraph without any line breaks, using standard English grammar and punctuation. Also, they emphasized changing as little as possible to make the text make sense.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the input text. It's wrapped in `<p>` tags, so it's an HTML paragraph tag. The content inside is \"Incredible.\" That's just one word ending with a period. My task is to remove the HTML tags and ensure proper formatting.\n\nSince there are no additional elements or unnecessary content beyond the HTML tags, I don't need to modify anything else except removing the tags. So, the cleaned version would simply be \"Incredible.\"\n\nNow, considering the formatting requirements: it should be a single paragraph without line breaks. However, since the text is only one sentence, it will naturally form a single line. There's no need for additional line breaks or spacing adjustments.\n\nThe user also mentioned that the final output should preserve the original meaning, which in this case is straightforward—there's nothing more to the original text besides expressing something incredible. Therefore, no changes are needed beyond removing the `<p>` tags.\n\nFinally, I'll present the cleaned text as \"Incredible.\"\n```\nIncredible.\n```\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Input Structure:** The input text is enclosed within `<p>` HTML tags, indicating it's a paragraph element.\n2. **Remove HTML Tags:** Extract the content inside the tags, discarding `<p>` and `</p>`.\n3. **Preserve Meaning:** Ensure the extracted text remains unchanged to maintain its original intent.\n4. **Format Properly:** Convert the text into a single paragraph with standard punctuation.\n5. **Output the Result:** Present the cleaned text as \"Incredible.\"\n\nThis approach ensures minimal changes while meeting all specified formatting requirements.\n```",

First, I will strip out the &lt;p&gt; tag and its closing &lt;/p&gt;. Next, I need to ensure proper grammar and punctuation. The original text reads: \"Very well compiled, I wish out build process was that smooth.\" There's a minor grammatical issue here: \"wish out build\" should be corrected to \"wish for a build\" or \"wish that the build\". To maintain minimal changes, I'll adjust it to \"I wish for a smoother build process.\" Additionally, there's an extra space before \"build,\" which I'll remove for consistency. Finally, I'll format it into a single paragraph without line breaks. The cleaned-up version is: \"Very well compiled, I wish for a smoother build process.\" This maintains the original sentiment while ensuring proper grammar and punctuation.\n```\n\nThe user wants me to clean up some text by removing HTML tags and making sure it's properly formatted. They mentioned keeping the original meaning intact but changing as little as possible. So, first, I need to get rid of the `<p>` tags. The text inside is \"Very well compiled, I wish out build process was that smooth.\"\n\nHmm, looking at this sentence, there's a typo. \"Wish out build\" doesn't sound right. Maybe they meant \"wish for a build\" or \"wish that the build.\" To keep things minimal, I'll go with \"wish for a smoother build process.\" Also, there's an extra space before \"build,\" so I should remove that.\n\nPutting it all together, the cleaned-up sentence flows better and is grammatically correct. Let me check if it captures the same sentiment. Yes, it does. The user gets a polished version without losing the original intent.\n\nSo, the final answer would be: \"Very well compiled, I wish for a smoother build process.\"\n```",
