                    "cooked": "Hi,\n\nI have a fundamental gap in knowledge regarding whether or not to reset the gyro to 0/180 depending on the alliance we are on. We are using AdvtangeScope’s base swerve drive as the foundation for our project and have made very few changes to it the swerve logic.\n\nA little context, the starting position during auto will have the gyro 0 physically facing the drive alliance. Meaning, without any PathPlanner calls to resetpose(), pressing forward on the joystick will always make forward drive towards the driverstation.\n\nA way around this, to me, would be to set the gyro angle to be 180 if we are on blue alliance, correct? However, here @gdefender ’s comment would suggest that we should not do this at all.\n\nWPILib doesn’t really mention setting the gyro’s position, which mean’s the linked comment above is probably accurate. But WPILib does make mention of inverting joysticks here\n\nI guess what I am looking for is a little guidance for best practices on what I need to do (if anything) to joysticks, gyro, etc if we are running with PathPlanner’s AutoBuilder and without (for drivers practice)\n\nThanks in advance,",

And his post is talking about what to reset when resetting the heading of the robot.\n\nFirstly, what to reset. I think the best way here is to not do any thing with your gyro. Don’t reset it, and don’t grab any data directly from it other than when you update your odometry. Only use the data from the odometry, and use your odometry to reset the position and heading when needed. Your odometry will handle all the offset things about your gyro.\n\nThen the heading stuff. Just make sure your robot is facing the right direction in the advantage scope and then invert the x and y  velocity input from your controller when you are on the red alliance. You can get what alliance you are in by calling the DriverStation.getAlliance() in your code.\n\nHope this could be helpful to you.",

Don’t reset your orientation so red becomes (0, 0) when you are on the red alliance, just flip the controls.\n\nThis year you can probably get away with origin follows alliance since the field is basically rotated , as long as you’re not doing global pose estimation with AprilTags. But if you go that route, there’s nothing to invert or reset, it just acts the same from the driver’s perspective.\n\nPathPlanner recommends you create all of your autos on the blue side, and use it’s feature to mirror the paths to red . As noted in the comment “THE ORIGIN WILL REMAIN ON THE BLUE SIDE”\n\nHEFZZJM:\n\nI think you and @gdefender are talking about 2 different things.\n\nI disagree, we are talking about the same thing.\n\nHEFZZJM:\n\nFirstly, what to reset.\n\nI recommend you don’t reset anything. Blue should always be the origin.\n\nHEFZZJM:\n\nInvert the x and y velocity input from your controller when you are on the blue alliance\n\nThis is a little confusing, but mostly accurate. Pushing up on the controller is negative. You want up to be negative when you’re on the RED alliance, so it’s technically correct, but differs from the way it’s explained in the documentation .",
