This is one of the members of the programming team at COLTech Robotics.\n\nI am currently trying to create methods for our vision subsystem, but I'm becoming increasingly frustrated. The function isn't working despite no error messages.\n\nSeveral potential issues have been identified, but none explain why the function isn't functioning correctly. For example, the targetObservation appears blank on every request, and cameras aren't connecting despite being reported connected in NetworkTables.\n\nWhile NetworkTables receive proper updates, the code fails to capture these values. This situation is confusing.\n\nThe provided code aims to compute the angle (in radians) to an AprilTag and align the robot's front with the tag's plane.\n\nAdditionally, it helps choose between two cameras for target centering.\n\nCommands, as shown in the first image, are used to interact with subsystems.\n\nAssistance is welcome!\n\n[Repository link](https://github.com/COLTech9059/2025Competition-Swerve/tree/dev-flight-stick)\n\nP.S.: We use the AZ-RBSI template as our foundation.",

Currently, it's invoked within the method itself, causing it to execute whenever the method runs, rather than when the Command does. Examining your code reveals that `OrientToAprilTagPlane` is called once to bind the command to a button, which means `determineBestCamera` is triggered at startup. If PhotonVision hasn't connected by then, it may return -1, leading you to bind `Commands.none()` to your button. Similarly, even if `camToUse` weren't -1, the yaw calculation occurs once at startup, causing the robot to repeatedly attempt the same angle. The solution is to move these calculations into the lambda responsible for determining yaw. This ensures that both `determineBestCamera` and yaw recalculations occur as the Command runs, rather than just once at startup.",

                    "cooked": "Yep, that was the issue. Thanks for the insight! I think I made a mistake in my reasoning earlier. After reviewing the problem again, it seems like I misunderstood the initial requirements. The correct approach should involve analyzing the data more thoroughly. I need to ensure that each step of my process aligns with the project's goals. Maybe I oversimplified the solution without considering all the constraints. Let me go back to the drawing board. Perhaps I should start by breaking down the problem into smaller parts. This will help me identify where I went wrong and how to fix it effectively. I'll also double-check the assumptions I made during the initial analysis to see if they still hold true. Collaborating with the team might provide additional insights. Sometimes, discussing the problem with others can reveal new angles or solutions that hadn't occurred to me before. I'll reach out to them later today. In the meantime, I'll work on validating my current approach against the updated requirements. If there are discrepancies, I'll adjust my plan accordingly. It's important to stay organized, so I'll document any changes I make along the way. Overall, this experience teaches me the value of continuous learning and the importance of verifying my understanding as I progress through complex projects. I'll apply these lessons moving forward to ensure better outcomes in future tasks.",
