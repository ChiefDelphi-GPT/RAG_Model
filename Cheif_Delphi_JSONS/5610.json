Your design shows a lot of creativity and effort, which is always exciting to see. As a rookie team, tackling CAD is a huge step, and you’re already off to a great start. First, some things done nicely: image 745×456 57.9 KB The belly pan is cool, the access hole for the kraken is well thought out. image 563×585 53.4 KB image 707×724 112 KB Your electronics mounts are impressive, especially having everything organized together. While 3D printing a battery mount can be challenging in terms of strength, the concept is neat and shows great foresight. image 797×550 68.4 KB The choice of gearboxes for pivot power is solid! Max Planetaries are a reliable and nicely packaged option. image 1124×541 125 KB The note skirt is pretty smart! Another option is to have your bumpers only raised on the side that you intake the note to use the bumpers as a skirt, but what you’ve done is an equally viable option.\n\nimage 745×456 57.9 KB\n\nimage 745×456 57.9 KB\n\nimage 563×585 53.4 KB\n\nimage 563×585 53.4 KB\n\nimage 707×724 112 KB\n\nimage 707×724 112 KB\n\nimage 797×550 68.4 KB\n\nimage 797×550 68.4 KB\n\nimage 1124×541 125 KB\n\nimage 1124×541 125 KB\n\nNow here’s a couple points of improvement: image 1156×503 135 KB While T-slot aluminum is common in general robotics, within FRC , 2x1 aluminum box tubing is much more popular. It’s stronger, easier to integrate with FRC -specific parts, and widely available from vendors like West Coast Products and REV Robotics . Transitioning to this material could make your robot sturdier and more adaptable… I would strongly recommend using this instead of T-slot extrusion. image 1013×470 94.6 KB The gear choice here is intriguing, but the pitch seems quite large. The FRC standard is typically 20DP gears, which you can find through suppliers like West Coast Products . Additionally, switching to hex shaft (1/2” or 3/8”) over round shaft would make your robot more compatible with standard FRC parts like pulleys, wheels, and hubs while also improving power transfer. Using a 3D-printed mount for the Kraken motor might not provide the durability you need. Extending the side plate up and using the hole pattern to secure the motor directly would be a stronger and more reliable solution. image 1029×607 139 KB I’m not quite sure where you would get these rollers or what material they are supposed to be. You can buy different wheels & rollers from andymark and West Coast Products and they work wonderfully. image 797×616 63.8 KB This almost definitely would not work. There will be a lot of torque transferred through any pivot especially as the robot bumps around, and half inch hex is definitely not going to hold up well at all, as well as add a ton of backlash/wiggle to the pivot which is not fun to program. Instead, I would use a large sprocket and chain or a sector gear to actuate this.\n\nimage 1156×503 135 KB\n\nimage 1156×503 135 KB\n\nimage 1013×470 94.6 KB\n\nimage 1013×470 94.6 KB\n\nimage 1029×607 139 KB\n\nimage 1029×607 139 KB\n\nimage 797×616 63.8 KB\n\nimage 797×616 63.8 KB\n\nIt’s amazing that you’re already diving into CAD, and I’d like to share a resource that has made a huge difference for my team: FRCDesign.org . This platform is maintained by experienced designers and provides an excellent workflow using Onshape, which I highly recommend as a rookie team. Onshape’s collaborative tools and parts library are invaluable for teams just starting out.\n\nIf you’re looking to connect with more experienced designers for feedback and advice, I’d also recommend joining the unofficial FRC Discord and David’s Design Server . Both are welcoming communities full of talented people willing to help.\n\nIf you need to convince mentors or teachers to explore these resources, feel free to direct them to the Discord servers or Chief Delphi. Speaking from experience, transitioning to Onshape with FRCdesign has been a huge leap for our team.\n\nI hope my feedback is helpful and not overwhelming. Its really awesome to see rookie teams connecting to the wider community for help!\n\nBest of luck to you and your team this season!",

Instead, I would use a large sprocket and chain or a sector gear to actuate this.\n\nTo add onto this, what you guys have created is called a “Live axle” pivot, meaning the shaft your shooter/indexer is rotating on is transmitting the torque to rotate it. Most teams nowadays use “Dead axle” pivots, meaning the shaft is not transmitting any torque at all, and the thing being rotated is often actually rotating around the axle.\n\nAs you can (maybe) see in this picture, we have our intake driven by a neo motor(through a max planetary like you guys), then a chain reduction to a sprocket directly bolted to our intake. This means the axle the intake rotates around doesn’t transmit any torque or add backlash to the system image 1179×1300 256 KB\n\nimage 1179×1300 256 KB\n\nimage 1179×1300 256 KB",

I would recommend going with a tube like approach, as although not important for this application, polycarb tube on something like an over the bumper intake withstands impacts better than a 3d print.

Most teams use a silicone tube or cats tongue tape to cover their rollers, or they go with a compliant/stealth wheel.",

You have the gears attached to the motor and I would be concerned about how well 3dp spline would hold up to the torque put on it. I would recommend using some type of adapter to help distribute the torque. You can find these from venders like Thriftybot and WCP . Although for thriftybot you would have to use a Kraken Spline to 1/2\" Hex Adapter and then the Aluminum Insert for 3D Printed Parts .\n\nOr you could use COTS gears instead that can handle the torque.\n\nEdit: I would also be concerned about the gears themselves holding up. 3d printed gears don’t tend to do well.",
