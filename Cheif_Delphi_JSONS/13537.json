So…\n\nTeams like 254 have obviously found success using the timed robot as a base, state machines, and their own system that works in tandem. So much so that their architecture has become the norm and is often copied many other high level teams.\n\nOn the other hand, Einstein-level teams like 2910 have been using command based programming for years and have also found tremendous success.\n\nThat begs the question, as a programmer who has only known command based programming with FRC, sometimes I feel like I am missing out on something when I don’t have a Robot periodic method that is 450 lines long.\n\nTLDR; For the high level teams like 254, 1678, etc. have you ever considered making the switch to command based? If not, what’s the impetus behind that decision?",

That’s an oversimplification but it somewhat gets the point across. Command based programming can simplify making more complex robots with less boilerplate code than timed programming and can also make it easier to program autos. It really boils down to what you know and can use best but I would recommend command based since it can simplify writing your code. Like oblarg said, the only (or maybe main if not only) reason those teams use timed based programming is because they have done so for many seasons in the past and have their own libraries written around it to make it easy to use timed programming.\n\n(i just realized how terribly written this was, sorry, i’m like very very tired right now lol)",

Develop an FSM for the logic of your mechanism and let the command-base schedule the commands in the order you specify.\n\nMy team has tracked similarly to others’ comments here in trying each year for a better organization and finally (I am hopeful) this upcoming season we’ll drop each season’s ad hoc development of command-base and use the WPILib system.",

This has led me to another question I have about command based code that I can only describe through an example.\n\nDevelop an FSM for the logic of your mechanism and let the command-base schedule the commands in the order you specify.\n\nLet’s say you had a turret subsystem, and you wanted multiple ways of controlling. (Ex. Vision tracked, manual, designated setpoints)\n\nWould it be preferable to create multiple commands (such as TurretTrackingTargetCommand, or ManualTurretControlCommand) where each command is scheduled and then unscheduled based on the desired behavior? To add to that, what if you wanted to change between these commands or states with sensor input (i.e. if the robot detects that it has a ball, it goes into vision tracking mode and vice versa), where would you schedule these commands? **\n\nOr\n\nWould it make sense to create a default turret command that acted like a state machine and transitioned through these behaviours based on a sensors input and if/case statements.\n\n** The only way my team has ever scheduled commands is through joystick inputs but as we try to make our robot more automated, we would like to know the best way to schedule commands when not using driver input. My initial guess would be through the robot periodic method, but unless you’re using some sort of latched Boolean, you’ll start scheduling the same command over and over again. Any advice, prior examples, or your teams standard would be super helpful.",

This doesn’t mean “never write an if statement,” but it does mean “try to minimize the number of if statements you have to write to represent the desired state flow.”  If you ever find yourself deeply nesting conditionals, you have probably made a mistake.\n\nMake sure you fully understand the Trigger class and how it can be composed to flexibly represent a variety of binding conditions.  Make sure you fully understand the Command decorators and how these can be used to build complicated/conditional actions from simple component pieces.\n\nOnce you fully grasp both of those, the decision of “where to put the complexity” doesn’t go away entirely (you always have to make decisions about your code!), but the pros and cons of each option will be much easier to judge.",

While hitting a file with more characters than days you’ve been alive might see like milestone, it’s often actually indicating a mess that breaks many of the rules of code design, including DRY (Do not Repeat Yourself) or SRP (Single Responsibility Principle). Maybe the worst part is that this much code is just hard to understand without spending a lot of time with it. From Robert C. Martin’s Book, Cleancode p25.:\n\nIn general prorammers are pretty smart people. Smart people sometimes like to show off their smarts by demonstrating their mental juggling abilities…One difference between a smart programmer and a professional programmer is that the professional understands that clarity is king . Professionals use their powers for good and write code that others can understand.\n\nI heavily stand behind the idea that if any file takes up more than 2 computer screen heights, you should take a look at your code and ask if it could be better understood if separated into multiple classes. Almost all teams are guilty of putting way too much code into one file, high level included. Don’t use line count as a metric for your coding ability.",

You get a lot of clarity by organizing your thoughts with a state diagram .\n\nWe developed a FSM for the intake/shuttle/shooter and it all starts with a state diagram of what is to happen based on what events trigger an action. I regret that the beautiful state diagram that a student drew is behind the Slack pay wall due to their change of terms for free service. But here is the transition table written from that diagram (ignore the circles and arrows and then the text was simply converted to Java variables and that shows in the image below). image 1438×588 92.2 KB\n\nimage 1438×588 92.2 KB\n\nimage 1438×588 92.2 KB\n\nThe code would have one if statement like this:\n\n/** * table lookup to determine new state given the current state and the event * * @param currentState * @param event * @return */ private static State findNextState (State currentState, Event event) { // for efficiency could check for no event but that’s another “if” statement to understand and it’s not // needed for the logic unless not finding a corresponding transition is considered an error for (Transition transition : Transition.values()) { if (transition.currentState == currentState && transition.event == event) return transition.nextState; }\n\n}\n\nor if it matters, one more if statement to see if the state changed or not because of the event.\n\npublic void checkStateChange(Event event) { // make the transition to a new currentState if an event triggered it\n\n}\n\nFSM training Java exercises Lectures notes compiled and edited from Internet sources available upon request.\n\nWith the clarity of thought required for the state diagram (it went through several quick review and comment cycles made easier with the simplicity and brevity of the diagram) and only one if statement in generalized code, the student’s FSM code worked on the robot the first time it compiled and ran!\n\nWe did not have time to develop a good idea about an event handler but did something not to sloppy.\n\nI think what I see and Oblarg is saying is the Trigger class is a good structure to manage events.\n\nAnd you have the right idea, of course, an event is a change between an old value and a new value that happens once at the time of the change. In the iterative robot we do at most one transition per cycle.",
