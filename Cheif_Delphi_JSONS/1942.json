I have no intention of building this, just using it to get familiar with the program. I have completed the chassis, bumpers, and electronics already, and as I began to think about manipulators, I realized I had no idea how to design the optimal funnel. I can make a funnel in any shape, but I have no idea what to do to minimize blockages or clogs. I looked to Steamworks for inspiration, but my questions still were’nt answered. I attached some designs I sketched for the sake of this post, with the first being much more realistic in my opinion (Based roughly off of teams such as Cheesy Poofs in 2017). All this being said, what do you guys take into account while designing funnels, and what could I improve? Thanks!

                    "cooked": "Ultimately, you’ll have to prototype it .\n\nThat said, some general rules of thumb:\n\nPassive funnels are simple to make, but often jam with lots of game objects (2017, form little “bridges” across width of funnel) or objects that cannot slide past each other (2020 balls). If all you can do is a passive funnel, make it as steep as possible and with slippery sides (polycarb or delrin, or cover it in PTFE tape ). Preferably do both ( 254-2025 ).\n\nBetter than passive would be something active. Powered rollers that actually pull the game objects through the funnel, and at the same time agitating and preventing jams ( 118-2017 , 973-2017 . If powered on both left and right or top bottom, sometimes helps to have a slight speed difference between the sides so asymmetry prevents jams. Can also shape the funnels asymmetrically which can help.\n\nIn between totally passive and powered funnel is something with an added agitator. A spinny wheel on one side geared off your main intake or feeder/shooter. Or maybe the deploy/retract of the entire intake agitates the hopper. (ex 148-2017 ).\n\nAll this said, classic design wisdom applies. Design what is within the resources (time, money, knowledge) of your team and best serves your goals for the season (make elims, win an event, win Einstein). Sometimes the simpler but done-sooner design you can tweak is better than spending weeks designing and building something theoretically 5% faster, but a more complicated design.",

Instead, the entire game piece storage is a conveyor that’s focused on getting the game piece lined up to go into the shooter.\n\nYou want to look at 2006, 2009, and 2017. Maybe a dose of 2012 and 2020/2021, which had higher limits but still needed a little bit of organization.\n\n2017 will be closer to the “tennis ball” setup, to be fair–but a look at how things were handled earlier may give a couple of clues.\n\nOne other key factor: How the game pieces interact with each other when in a pile would be quite insightful. I wouldn’t do it for just a design exercise, but if there were a game where I needed to store a lot of tennis balls on my robot, the very first thing I would do would be to go get a bunch of tennis balls and pile them up and see what they did as far as settling down, forming bridges, does that change with using different materials for the containment of the pile, etc. If they’re dropping through with minimal issue, no agitator needed. If they’re needing agitation to move, then how much agitation becomes a key factor in designing the chute or agitation methods.",

Try to copy designs of robots that proved close to “optimal” on the field (say champs winners), then look at their tech binders or released CAD (if they exist).\n\nTennis balls (fuzzy, rubber) react different under pressure than the fuel cells (slippery, plastic). So optimizing a design without any hands-on data to feedback into the process is never going to really be optimized.",
