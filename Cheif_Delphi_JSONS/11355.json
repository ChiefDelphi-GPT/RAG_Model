                    "cooked": "Hello!\n\nWe have an arm on our robot this year that includes a wrist on a telescope rotating on an axle about 3 feet above the top of the frame of our robot. We have noticed that around -90 degrees(straight down) we have a significant jolt on the arm when moving both forward and backward. It’s accentuated when we run a control loop on our arm, and our leading theory is that it’s the chain tension “switching sides” such that it’s always on the gravity side. This makes controlling it a little more difficult, but more so, it seems as though there should be a mechanism to remove this slop, as well as the general slop of the mechanism(~5 degrees) that usually isn’t seen, because gravity keeps us on one side of the slop. I’m wondering how other teams have approached this issue, or general advice for removing slop in mechanisms. Thank you!!",

                    "cooked": "Hahaha, we had the exact same issue as you guys. First, are you sure the slop is coming from your chain? More specifically, what gearbox are you using? We found that most of the slop in our arm was coming from our gearbox rather than the chain.\n\nSecond, how tensioned is your chain? If its too loose you can calculate the center distance and add the correct amount of links, or just guess and check (what we did). Beyond that you will probably want some way to quickly tension your chain when it stretches, can you move your gearbox to tension it? If not, you can incorporate a chain tensioner somewhere in-between your two sprockets, Mcmaster has a few options for one .\n\nIf none of that works you may want to consider using some form of spring to constantly push your arm to one side of the slop. We incorporated gas shocks which helped with the slop issue, it was still there and our arm still shakes a bit while in resting position, but its far less noticeable. I will send a pic when I’m by the robot tomorrow.",

                    "cooked": "oops sorry, forgot to take a picture, here is one after lake superior. GasShock3 615×597 49.9 KB As you can see (maybe) the gas shock is connected to a static point just below our pivot, as well as the end of the arm. These provide a constant upward force that ensures our arm is always on one side of the slop.\n\nGasShock3 615×597 49.9 KB\n\nGasShock3 615×597 49.9 KB\n\nPart of our inspiration for using gas shocks came from 6045, the other part came from the trunk of one of our mentors cars. This might be a bit more helpful in understanding it. image 800×800 72.8 KB (Random picture I found off google) The shocks base is connected just below the trunks pivot point, and the tip is connected near the end. A potential downside to this, is that most of the force in resting position is pushing down rather than out. This doesn’t really help with the arm rocking, but does mean your motors aren’t constantly fighting 120 pounds of force.\n\nimage 800×800 72.8 KB\n\nimage 800×800 72.8 KB\n\nI assume a large amount of the play in your arm is coming from that final spur gear ratio, as max planetaries have relatively small amounts of play. I have heard of teams fixing that by jamming shims in-between the gear bore and hex shaft, or by machining/3d printing something to fit in-between the shaft and gear bore. Can you provide the spur gears used as well as center distance between them?\n\nDo you have an encoder directly on the final stage of your arm, like directly on the arm pivot itself? Having our encoder on the final arm pivot has helped massively for us. Also, do you “fight” the arm rocking with a PID? I’m not a programmer, but as I understand it after our arm returns to home it does not run anything. The PID ends and we just let the arm rock as the robot drives.\n\nUnfortunately it is almost impossible to fully remove play from systems that involve gears, as gears need a bit of backlash to prevent excessive wear. Hope this helped, best of luck in Wisconsin btw!",

I guess I don’t understand how the gas shock can have the reach while maintaining a linear force when it’s not concentric with the axle. For some more information, we actually have a pigeon gyro on the arm, it’s an odd choice but we made it work, and the final gear ratio is a 1:1 between 30t - 30t 20dp gears, another odd choice, but the result of many iterations. As for the pid, after the arm is done moving, we “set a lock position” that is the current position of the arm, and run the pids of the shoulder, telescope, and wrist to that set point so that the arm doesn’t move while we move, and so our telescope doesn’t sag and fall into the belly pan of our robot. This allowed us to lower the gear ratio such that we didn’t have to rely on the braking of the motor which resulted in significantly faster actuation. Thank you again!",
