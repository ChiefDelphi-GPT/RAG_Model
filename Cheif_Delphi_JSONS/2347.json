I just looked inside the guts of the program, and this is the only mention of “RIO” in it.\n\nIf this is what you have been seeing, reread the message a bit more carefully.\n\nThe radio has several Ethernet ports. One is labeled DS , like you’ve noticed. Another port, at the opposite end of the radio, is labeled RIO . Either of those ports should be perfectly acceptable to plug in to for this procedure.\n\nI personally always use the DS port. If that’s what you’re using too, great!\n\nNow, the Network Assistant Tool doesn’t actually do that much. It doesn’t update the firmware or set your team number or anything. For this reason, I’m going to hope for a moment that your computer is in a relatively common configuration and that we can skip using the NAT altogether…\n\nAs long as the radio is powered up and has had a minute or two to fully boot, you should in theory be able to talk to the radio as soon as you figure out what its IP address is.\n\nMake sure the Ethernet cable you’re using is known to be good and that it’s plugged securely into both your computer and the radio port. The port on the radio has an LED at its top left that should be on if you have a working physical connection.\n\nOnce you have confirmed you have a working physical connection…\n\nIf the radio hasn’t already been configured before, the easiest next step (crossing our fingers that your computer’s Ethernet adapter is configured for DHCP) would be going to http://10.0.1.1 in a browser and see if that gets you to the configuration page. If your radio has been configured with a team number, try http://10.TE.AM.1 , which for [checks profile] team 801 would be http://10.8.1.1 .\n\nNote: While VH says the Wired address to get to the configuration page is 192.168.69.1 , I personally have had no success with that. I’ve always used 10.0.1.1 for an unconfigured radio and 10.TE.AM.1 for a configured (team number set) radio. As it turns out, the 192.168.69.x address is what the Network Assistant Tool seems to be using, so using that might be doomed. I’ve never used it, so I wouldn’t know. “My way” assumes that your Ethernet adapter is set to use DHCP already, which, while not guaranteed by any means, is pretty common.\n\nIf you’ve successfully reached the configuration page, you can update the firmware and set up the Team Number and network passwords. Do the firmware update(s) first, since they generally wipe out your settings.\n\nLet me know if this gets you anywhere…",
