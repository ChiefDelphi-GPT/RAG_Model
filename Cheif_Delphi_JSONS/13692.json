I felt this was deserving of it’s own thread all together.\n\nSo my question to those more experienced than I, what lathe and tooling would you recommend for a team looking to purchase their first lathe?\n\nI personally am more interested in manual lathe setups, but am sure there are some that would perhaps appreciate input on CNC options too.\n\nPerhaps work around 3 “budget levels”/use cases.\n\nBasic/entry level, only needs to be able to machine 1/2\" aluminum hex shaft.\n\nIntermediate, can handle all you hex shaft needs and turn other/larger aluminum bits and bobs (thinking a climber spool or something similar).\n\nAnd finally, what you would consider your Rolls Royce setup for an FRC team?\n\nRemember, a team that’s never owned a lathe before is going to need tooling as well. It’s not all just about the machine.",

                    "cooked": "Big subject.  I’ll focus on FRC here.\n\nA metal lathe is a good investment, particularly a ‘screw-cutting’ lathe (it can cut screw threads).  The important numbers are swing (largest diameter) and length. 6\" is a small swing, 10\" is adequate for most anything, 16\" is too large. Length should be in the ~18-30\" range, but longer is OK.\n\nBigger machines have bigger holes through the headstock, meaning a shaft can slide into and through the chuck for machining. This is important. Less than 1/2\" hole in the spindle is too small. 3/4\" is a good, generous size. The Grizzly below has a 25 mm spindle hole.\n\nTooling, toolholders and accessories can be expensive. Try to buy a lathe like a Grizzly G0602 that comes with the accessories you’ll need. Get a cabinet unless you can fabricate a very sturdy one, it needs to be very rigid.\n\nTooling (cutting bits) are not expensive. You can get a nice set of carbide tools with the five basic shapes for maybe $60. Blank steel bits are under $10, you can grind them yourself, but few do that today except for a special-purpose bit.\n\nTool holders are more expensive. A good AXA-size tool holder base and a couple of tool holders can be $150, or over $1000 for an Aloris brand. A cut-off tool, a set of boring bars, etc. are all in the $100 range or less.\n\nAccessories can be very expensive, but a new lathe usually comes with more than you need. A 3-jaw chuck is most useful, but there are times when only a 4-jaw chuck will do. Get both if possible.\n\nAlso, the type headstock and tailstock tapers (MT-2,- 3, R8, etc) influence the cost of accessories. Morse Taper (MT) are very common and thus somewhat less expensive.\n\nBy far the most important tool is a book on how to use and care for the lathe. Selecting the right bit, feed, and speed will deliver best performance, Caring for the machine will let it last a literal lifetime. I have an Atlas 10D lathe that is from the 1950s, it was cared for and still cuts great, I can get better than 0.001\" accuracy out of it with care.  South Bend’s “ How to use a Lathe ” (PDF link) is a good choice, there are others. My copy is from 1934, and very little has changed from then…\n\nI have oils, greases, and lots of brushes and cloths to keep the lathe clean, and it gets cleaned after each and every usage. Be sure your students understand this requirement. Unlike, say, a drill press, a dirty and un-oiled lathe will fail in a relatively short time. Even my CNC doesn’t get hurt by not cleaning it often, unlike the lathe.",

Anything more and you should be using a CNC turning center. You’ll want something capable of threads on the coarse size for winch drums. Collet chuck is nice, but annoying to swap around all the time. If you have two machines one should be a collet though.\n\nThe machine itself…up to what you think you’ll use and if anybody else shares the space. Objectively, anything with a bed longer than 4’ would be impossible to use on an FRC robot, and and getting past a foot is impractical unless you’re like me and use the lathe for sketchy polishing jobs. Something with an unusually large through hole spindle will often come in handy.",

I am looking at getting gun taps (I believe that’s what I’m supposed to be looking into anyway) to tap the ends of an axle in the future on the recommendation of one of our mentors, but I need to make sure I know what I’m buying there before I go off and buy it.",

You start with a larger hole than normal and you form the Aluminum out AND in.  You end up with strong threads and a hole smaller than you started with.  They are MUCH stronger than regular taps too.",

Part is likely ruined and tap is probably broken.",

                    "cooked": "Your team has never owned a lathe before.  I’m gonna assume you also do not have an experienced machinist either or you likely wouldn’t be asking your questions.  Forgive me if I’ve assumed too much. So with that in mind…\n\nI’d suggest not buying an entry level machine.  You’ll outgrow it pretty fast. I’d suggest not buying a Rolls either.  You can better spend the money on tooling and accessories.\n\nSo, Mama bear is best for FRC, IMHO.  Without going into specific brands or models, I’d look for one that that can accommodate a collet closer (“Royal” collet closer style).  This allows for a stop to be used in a collet and repetition of parts is much easier.  …You’re always gonna be making multiple widgets.  A collet (and collet closer) will greatly increase your efficiency.\n\nA collet set and closer infers a thru hole in the head to be at least 1.125\" diameter.  That will determine the minimal lathe size (swing).  Bed length will vary. A lot. You can buy a lathe with a thru holes less than 1.125\" but that won’t maximize the efficiency of the 5C collets.\n\nYou can look into a full collet set or just the major fractional sizes you work with.  The larger the set, the more it cost. Be sure to purchase collets that have a threaded internal hole.  These accommodate threaded stops which work better than friction stops in the non-threaded hole version.  …the friction stops can be used in a threaded hole, but I wouldn’t buy one in the first place.  …remember, the outer diameter of the tail end of the collet is always threaded for whatever device closes that collet (Royal collet closer or other method).\n\nThe three jaw chuck should have an adjustable backing plate so you can dial in the concentricity semi-permanently.  Yes, a four jaw can do this, but you’ll be doing it with every part.  Inefficient.  The three jaw should also have bolt on jaws so you can replace the factory steel jaws and also use machinable soft (Aluminum) jaws.  …learn how to machine soft jaws on both your lathe and mill.\n\nA steady rest is also useful for FRC parts.  It’ll help stabilize long parts.  A back burner project for me is to replace the standard bronze guides with bearing.  I’d recommend that too.\n\nUse a quick change tool post and holders (Aloris or clone).  I prefer the wedge lock style over the cheaper piston lock style (just the way I was taught and used most of my career).  A quick change tool post will allow you to, well, quickly change tools!  Say: face the part, change tools to turn a diameter, change again to part off.  You can easily keep repeating process cuz, remember, you’re gonna be making more than one widget.\n\nDRO are cheap these days, but don’t skimp too much.  You want one that will accept multiple tool offsets.  …to take more advantage of your quick change tool post. Shouldn’t be an issue, but ensure there is a diameter reading as well as radii reading.  You’ll really want the X axis to read in diameter.  Once you have the diameter turning tool set up, you can cut/turn directly to a specific diameter.  Radii needs some arithmetic and is thus a place for silly mistakes. If you mount the slides yourself, ENSURE they are parallel with the axis travel. If a DRO is out of budget, 2\" travel dial indicators with magnetic bases will work for most FRC parts.  …I  have a setup like this at home with my POS lathe.  Trav-a-dial is another option.  But by the time you buy one for each axis, you’re getting close to cheap DRO pricing.\n\nGrinding HSS tools is a learned art.  Not the hardest thing to do, but you’ll also need a good grinder and wheels with a decent wheel dresser.  Good understanding of how the tool cuts and pressures the part is useful.  Learning to grind in “chip breakers” is helpful.  So, I’d recommend replaceable carbide inserts.  Significantly higher up front costs, but faster and easier in a FRC environment. If you’re buying inserts, then stay away from the brazed-on carbide “sets”.  Those need a diamond wheel to sharpen.  You can use a stone designed for carbide, but it’s a lot harder to actually get the edge you’ll want.  Actually, you’d probably need the stone for roughing and the diamond for honing the edge.\n\nLook for inserts that have a high rake angle, are “dead sharp”, and are polished for the free flow cutting of aluminum and plastics.   Most inserts you’ll buy have a lower rake and larger edge radius for strength and durability on steel, stainless, etc.  You’ll need some of those inserts too, but I’ll bet the majority of what your cutting is non-ferrous. All kinds of new coatings are available for inserts.  You can let the marketing folks sell you the proper one for your application.  But for a non production environment (like FRC bots), I don’t see the need to pay for anything other than the high polish.  Others will likely disagree.\n\nPSA:  Tie long hair back AND up.  No long sleeves.  No draw string (on hoodies, etc.).  No dangling ear rings/piercings, necklaces.  Learn to control a manual lathe (X, Z handles) when NOT standing in the path of thrown chips (stand off to the right side a bit). DO NOT extend stock out the back of the head.  Do I really need to mention safety glasses with side shield?\n\nI know I didn’t answer your question about what lathe to buy, but I believe almost any lathe that meets your size requirements will work.  I hoped to offer some of the after purchase questions.",

                    "cooked": "I don’t think I’m going to be able to offer much ‘buy this lathe’ advice, but perhaps more thoughts as others have added regarding lathes in general…\n\nOur school is fortunate to have a robust lathing setup, with nine lathes. We have what I’d describe as 5 ‘good/great’ lathes, and 4 ‘okay so long as you baby them to death and don’t do anything too strenuous lathes’.\n\nTo get what we have for good/great lathes, you’ll have to dig out your time machine, venture back to 1968 and pick up a Clausing 6956. Place it somewhere you’ll be able to find in the future (or squeeze it into your time machine) and when you get back to 2022, hop on the lathe and go about your business.\n\nAll of which is to say, all of our ‘good’ lathes are older than most of the teachers in the building.\n\nOn them, we’re slowly changing over all of our tooling to Phase II, quick change style toolposts with Borite tool holders (about $1200 all together, we’ve been doing about one tool post a year). Two of our machines still run lantern-style toolposts . They get the job done, but you have to be diligent in teaching kids how to set them up. With any sort of quick change system, you teach them how to drop them in and that’s really all they need. (I’m not sure you can even buy lathes with lantern style toolposts anymore…)\n\nOur other 4 lathes started out as the other 6 lathes a year ago. They’re budget machines off of Amazon . They get the job done but they’re far from great. The headstock gears are plastic and can shear if you look at the machine funny (and you can’t replace them, I’ve tried). But, alas, they’re the machines I was given. If you treat them right and don’t do anything too crazy, cutting aluminum can still be done easily. Max diameter is around 1\" (less for through bore, would be fine for 1/2\" hex).\n\nWe have three different tooling setups for those mini-lathes, because I was experiment with different options. In general, we use things that use indexable cutting tips so they can be easily replaced, in a variety of different tool holders.\n\nMaintenance-wise, the mini-lathes are more finicky, but I’ve not noticed anything too crazy.\n\nSo, basic level. I’d say pretty much anything that can hold your stock will work. If you’re not sure you’ll use the machine much, give a cheap one a shot and figure out if you like it. Better tooling can make a poor lathe a good one. (Worked in my case) But if you think you’ll be doing more, don’t go cheap, you’ll hate every moment once you understand that it’s not doing that very basic thing it should be doing that you want it to do.\n\nI don’t know what I’d consider a ‘Rolls Royce’ setup, but I’m a big fan of the buy-it-for-life and ‘buy once, cry once’ line of thinking when it comes to stuff like this. Clearly, it can work out, because someone at my school bought lathes back in the late 1960’s that we’re still using daily in our manufacturing classes.",
