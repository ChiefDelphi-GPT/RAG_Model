                    "cooked": "What resistances are expected between the battery and PDH ?\n\nOur bot competed at Port Hueneme 10 days ago where we suffered an enormous amount of brownouts. This was new to our team. We would start with a battery ~12.5V and then at the very start of a match get hit with brownouts where the motors would be turning on/off and our pigeon angle would get lost. After the match we could check the logs and see the PDH voltage dropping to 9 or 8V. We are running a 8 NEO 1.1 swerve bot. This would have a current spike when starting and then stabilize at ~150A with a voltage 9 to 8 V. When stopped the battery would instantly recover to 12.5V. This was found on at least 5 different batteries used.\n\nIn order to reproduce the brownout we need to run the motors at full power which was very hard to achieve in the pit or practice area. In the last week we have cleaned up multiple issues but have not found root cause. Putting in motor current limits down to 20A stabilizes the motor controllers but we are still losing the pigeon2. And the swerve drive direction jumps around. We believe the pigeon2 loses power while the bot is rotating and loses its calibration. CTRE indicates pigeon2 would function to 6V.\n\nThe battery voltage recovers with low current draw indicating its not power loss but voltage drop across a resistance. I got this heater to use as a ~50A electrical load. My plan is to plug this into the PDH and trace the voltage from battery to heater wire. We are using the typical SB50 and 6AWG battery connections into the main breaker and then the PDH . What resistances are “normal” across these connections?\n\nWhat else should I be looking at?

Presuming on the order of milliohms for crimped joints, etc…Overall for your situation I would expect to see a smoking gun of most of the voltage drop across a particular set of points indicating your problem area.\n\nA point to check maybe quickly is your main breaker. Is it OPTIFUSE brand that comes in the Kit Of Parts? There is documentation on CD of many teams experiencing a higher than expected failure rate of those devices, a spot-check there would be good.\n\nNow there are other root-causes on the fishbone diagram for your robots symptoms as @RockRGI and @Thad_House have indicated one.\n\nAnother is: how old are your batteries? One failure mode of lead acid batteries is reduced capacity. This can manifest in the current/voltage relationship you describe - looks fine open circuit but put a load on it and it drops severely. Given 5 different batteries give you similar behavior its less likely that this is the problem, but it is one bone on the fishbone.",

I would recommend removing the insulation from a battery’s terminals so you can check to see if the voltage AT THE BATTERY drops significantly under load.  If it does, your problem is the battery itself.\n\nFor anyone else: a fair dummy load we made once was to take two “practice” grade motors (If you have CIMs lying around and you’re brushless, there’s your answer) and install them in the same gearbox.  Use a breaker, and wire them opposite directions.  It should only take a second or so per connection to figure out if your voltage drop is from inside the battery or across the wiring/connectors, and larger motors can certainly stand a second of stall without damage.",

There is documentation on CD of many teams experiencing a higher than expected failure rate of those devices, a spot-check there would be good.”-Yes Optifuse, but it seems OK. Will keep an eye on it.\n\nJwal: “how old are your batteries? Given 5 different batteries give you similar behavior its less likely that this is the problem” – agreed. Same behavior on lightly used year old batteries and new batteries.\n\nJoeT “Could you talk a little more about your startup current spike and stabilized current at ~150A? How big was that spike, and are you seeing a continuous 150A draw during a match?”- My drivers tend to be erratic and difficult to get a steady current. I’ve focused on a test run with a fairly steady 150A draw for~3 sec where the battery voltage dropped from 12.5 down to ~8.5V. Focusing in on these logs is my major next step.\n\nJoeT “Running 8-9v at 150A sounds plausible, and I wouldn’t necessarily expect brownouts to occur until the voltage is lower.”- great to know. One of the challenges is understanding what is normal.",

I’ll shift to battery quality, test logs, and motor current limiting. Here is what I found in the load test\n\nBattery just off the charger, no cool down, so likely skin charge present\n\nBattery beak: 112%, 0A 13.152V, 1A 13.127V, 18A 12.897V, internal resistance 0.017 Ohm\n\n12 V heater connected to PDH through a Rev 40A breaker. The heater is rated at 600W which would be ~50A, but we didn’t measure the current to verify.\n\nConnect battery and turn on the 12V heater\n\nMeasure voltage across the battery posts 12.52V\n\nMeasure voltages down the positive connections (calc the resistance assuming 50A)\n\n0mV (0 mOhm): Battery post to Cu fitting\n\n20 mV (0.4mOhm): Cu fitting at battery to wire-SB50 crimp\n\n5.1mV (0.1mOhm): Across the SB50\n\n7.0mV (0.1mOhm): SB50 to post of main breaker\n\n23.7mV (0.5mOhm): Across posts of the main breaker\n\n2.3mV (0.05mOhm): post of main breaker to input of the PDH\n\n130.0mV (2.6mOhm): PDH input to PDH output to the heater\n\n11.09V: measure positive to negative at the PDH output\n\nMeasurements on the negative connections\n\n21.3mV (0.4mOhm): missed measurement of the PDH output to input\n\n9.7mV (0.2mOhm): PDH input to the SB50\n\n3.4mV (0.07mOhm): Across the SB50\n\n23.0mV (0.5mOhm): SB50 to battery post\n\n11.3V measured across the battery terminals\n\nRepeat the battery beak: 52%, 18A 12.064V\n\nThe data is complicated as the battery voltage and test current were dropping through the test. But I’m looking for big losses and will ignore that. This indicates 257mV drop across the connection between the battery posts and a PDH output at 50A. With hard driving 4 motors at 50A each this would be a 528mV drop. We are seeing a much bigger voltage drop. The 2.6mOhm resistance of the 40A breaker is higher than I’d like. We’ll monitor that, but its not driving brownouts.\n\nAnything look like trouble in the above?\n\nNow to focus more on battery quality and limiting motor currents.",

With a 12.5v no-load voltage, you’ll see ~10v at the battery at the 150A load.  With a 10v maximum before you cross the first wire, measuring 8v-9v voltage at the PDH seems reasonable, and is in line with voltage measurements we’ve seen in our hardware in competition.\n\nWhat’s harder to understand is why your Pigeon 2 is browning out.

I’m not sure why, or what that did, but that greatly improved the stability. I was many weeks since the team went through the calibration routine. Second we found a loose connection feeding the VRM so the Pigeon was loosing power once in a while. Brownout yes but completely different from a battery drain issue.\n\nWe constrained our motors down to 40A and that has prevented our brownouts and keeps the drivestation voltage above 10V (at least with a reasonably fresh battery). Many teams function OK with limits of 60-80A just fine. We’ll keep looking at this. And we are getting much smarter in our log reviews.",
