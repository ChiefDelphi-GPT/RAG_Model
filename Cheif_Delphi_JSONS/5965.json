If its just BooleanSuppliers dont bother as Trigger’s have the same API for getting their state. On the other hand exposing a supplier from say an encoder or something could be nice. IMO its a pretty niche case as most of the time all state you want to expose can be encapsulated into Triggers.\n\nnarmstro:\n\nThere was some great discussion in the original post about using/not using default Command and periodics.\n\nI don’t really see the benefits in periodics for much other than for logging unless your subsystem is structured as a state machine but I think most subsystems can be created in much less verbose ways than a state machine. Default Commands are a bit of a different case for me cause I can see very good cases for using default Commands. A good example is our arm this year used a default Command to move into its intaking and speaker shot position. This was the position we wanted it in most of the time as it was also the most stable position for our robot so it made sense to use a default Command. Even in this example you can see that a default Command of control loop disabled probably would’ve had the same impact but been a bit clearer that its the default IMO.\n\nA note on your implementation here I don’t see the benefit of having controlLoopEnable as a seperate factory. Its only used in the setGoal function so it could just be implemented there Personally I’d also make setGoal private and expose its functionality through setpoint functions to make it clear what each position does to the caller (eg for the 2024 game moveToSpeaker , moveToAmp ). An even clearer option would be to make setGoal take an enum that has setpoints then just match the enum to determine where to move it to.\n\nOverall I think its quite a nice example.",

That’s general purpose and not bound to a clock cycle.

I think the way I’d change this is to make the setGoal call in the initializer.\n\nAs for how to handle the large sequence, I’d consider doing two things. First, use the asProxy() decorator to modify the setGoal command and keep the sequence from inheriting the elevator subsystem as a requirement. This will ensure that commands 1 & 2 don’t interrupt the pre-existing instance of controlLoopEnable and cause an extended loss of control.\n\nThe second thing I’d consider is making commands 4 & 5 trigger on whatever condition would satisfy the condition of occuring after command 3 or setGoal, maybe the BooleanSupplier of isAtGoal.\n\nIt may be desirable to keep the entire sequence together, but without some different specialized decorators that would handle this kind of scenario, I think this is the ‘state machine’ oriented way to handle this case.
