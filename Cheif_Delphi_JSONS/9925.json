Meanwhile we’re prototyping a swerve chassis, and are concerned about the motors taking a hit. So we used the old cutting board to make a rough concept to protect the corners. The discussion came up about whether the HDPE would be considered part of the perimeter (assuming constructed and fastened much better than in the photo) or it would be considered something not a part of the perimeter. The perimeter definition is: fixed, non-articulated structural elements of the ROBOT contained within the BUMPER ZONE .\n\nWhat do you think - would something like this pass inspection or not, assuming the bumpers were constructed so it was inside the bumper zone?",

As to passing inspection, I don’t have enough information.  It appears to me that the HDPE is thicker than 1/4\" so my first question would be is the portion not protected by the HDPE longer than 8\" (see rule R410 and the red arrow below):\n\nScreen Shot 2023-11-10 at 11.12.21 AM 940×770 67.4 KB\n\nScreen Shot 2023-11-10 at 11.12.21 AM 940×770 67.4 KB\n\nScreen Shot 2023-11-10 at 11.12.21 AM 940×770 67.4 KB\n\nIf so then you can’t have bumpers across that region w/o adding support for them.  If you are just doing corner bumpers, as long as they and the HDPE are at least 6\" across, that would also work.",

Most likely if we created a “cage” to protect our motors it would be from 1/8 or 1/4\" aluminum, and mounted to the top of the 1x 2, and not HDPE, although we like the increased impact resistance of the HDPE. And instead of using an old, discarded cutting board we would purchase HDPE stock from somewhere. If we did something like in the photo we would definitely have any gaps >8\" filled with the hdpe or something else.\n\nWe mainly had a question about whether something like that would be part of the frame or not.\n\nAgain, thank you!",
