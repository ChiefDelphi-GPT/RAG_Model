It theoretically offers light weight and easy assembly/maintenance. Screen Shot 2024-08-28 at 2.05.09 PM 1448×1182 69.2 KB\n\nScreen Shot 2024-08-28 at 2.05.09 PM 1448×1182 69.2 KB\n\nScreen Shot 2024-08-28 at 2.05.09 PM 1448×1182 69.2 KB\n\nBlue arrow is a 0.75\" OD 0.25\" ID 0.28\" width bearing. The current design has it retained by being clamped between two polycarbonate plates, but it could easily use something else (i.e., a bearing hat).\n\nGreen arrow is a 3/8\" OD aluminum tube with the ID drilled out to 0.25\". It looks slanted in the screenshot because of the background; it’s not. It exists because I was worried about the 3D printed part breaking if it was extended out to contact the bearing inner race, since there would be very little material there, as well as having shear forces going across layer lines.\n\nPink arrow is a high-infill ABS timing pulley (the interference marks are from a simplified belt). Yellow arrow is a 1/4-20 heat-set insert. Red arrow is a VEX grip tube held to the printed part with button head self-drilling screws.\n\nThe rest of the intake has the same setup with various forms of timing pulleys and/or 10dp herringbone gears.\n\nEdit: spelling, grammar",

I could understand if it was long enough to reach the heat-set insert, or short enough just to space the 3D printed pulley from the bearing.  But I can’t see the reasoning for this in-between length\n\nI would make the pulley as large as possible, while being smaller than the 2\" tube OD.  Larger pulley means less force on the 3D printed teeth.\n\nAs with all designs of this type, the risk is that the internal thread comes loose or breaks free from the 3D print.  In that case, it becomes really difficult to disassemble.   Caveat emptor.",

In general, I like the idea (and assume this is just one end and the other end is essentially a mirror of this).\n\nLike the aluminum tubing idea.  As far as length, you want enough sticking into the part to be able to resist any bending forces from just immediately loosening it.  How much?  Off the top, I might consider having it inserted into the 3D print on the order of 2-3x the distance it sticks out.  This is more of an empirical thing than a formula I can point to but it seems to satisfy my mental model of being better able to withstand radial forces on the roller by spreading them over a larger area in the 3D print and reducing the effective lever arm of the length that sticks out versus the inserted length.\n\nI think his last point is a really good one.  One way to avoid this is to thread directly into the 3D print.  If the threaded insert comes lose, this thing is gonna be a bear to get apart.  If the threads in the 3D printed part strip, you’ll be able to get it apart and get that bolt out.\n\nI love threaded inserts but they might become the source of anguish in this case.\n\nNice design - feel a sense of calm looking at it because you’re using the bearing the way it should be and everything can assemble nice and snug and still spin freely.\n\nNice shootin’ Tex!",

                    "cooked": "why such a long spacer (green arrow). I could understand if it was long enough to reach the heat-set insert, or short enough just to space the 3D printed pulley from the bearing. But I can’t see the reasoning for this in-between length\n\nMy goal here was to have maximum length, to make it easier to clamp on when drilling out the main bore, while still having some printed material. My theory was having that printed material would make the bolt’s clamp force makes the assembly less likely to slip relative to itself, minimizing risk of the bolt unscrewing. Whether that theory holds any water is up to people with more experience than I.\n\nI would make the pulley as large as possible, while being smaller than the 2\" tube OD. Larger pulley means less force on the 3D printed teeth.\n\nNoted; I’ll make sure to do this should we implement this in the future. Thanks!\n\nAs with all designs of this type, the risk is that the internal thread comes loose or breaks free from the 3D print. In that case, it becomes really difficult to disassemble. Caveat emptor.\n\nI hadn’t thought of this. My main complaint with other designs was loose bolts being difficult to maintenance, but I suppose this is susceptible to something similar. Thanks for the feedback @nuclearnerd !\n\nI think his last point is a really good one. One way to avoid this is to thread directly into the 3D print. If the threaded insert comes lose, this thing is gonna be a bear to get apart. If the threads in the 3D printed part strip, you’ll be able to get it apart and get that bolt out.\n\nRemoving and reapplying the wood screws is at most a five minute process, in my experience. I’m not sure that I trust 3DP threads - have you found success with them?\n\nOne other thing to keep in mind regarding maintenance, if the roller has this on each end, it’s essentially captive because the aluminum tubing sticks out into the bearing retainer so this isn’t just a “pull the the bolt on each end and lift it out”.\n\nThis is a good point. In intakes, it shouldn’t matter - deflecting a 0.25\" poly plate by 0.1\" is not incredibly difficult - but I should be using poly plates or an additional spacer in the indexer rollers that use this. Thanks for the feedback @zog !\n\nI think you can convert the aluminum spacer to 3DP without a lot of risk. There isn’t actually shear there; that’s taken up by the bolt.\n\nThis was mostly a pre-assembly worry, since I’ve broken prints with that little material by holding them wrong a few times. I suppose that printing spares would solve this problem just as well.\n\nWhat’s going to happen is that the bolt is going to try and embed in the pulley as it rotates relative to the pulley axis.\n\nI’m not sure I understand here. Mind clarifying before I say something dumb?\n\nA conical protrusion will optimize your stresses. Make sure you contact as much of the inner race as you can, and consider a metal washer on there to increase the contact area with the plastic.\n\nYou mean something like this? Bearing → washer → pulley, left → right.\n\nScreen Shot 2024-08-28 at 4.36.57 PM 528×736 155 KB\n\nScreen Shot 2024-08-28 at 4.36.57 PM 528×736 155 KB\n\nScreen Shot 2024-08-28 at 4.36.57 PM 528×736 155 KB\n\nUsing a bolt with an unthreaded section in a close fitting hole will optimize this whole thing.

The friction against the 3D printed material will help retention and you probably aren’t going to torque those bolts to yield or anything.\n\nIf you go that route, you will want to look at a printing orientation most likely along the hole axis to print halfway decent threads which is pretty much what I’d expect for this part even without considering threaded holes.\n\nTry to minimize support in the threads and consider running a tap through to clean up if you have any trouble but I’d think you’d be OK otherwise.",

Depends on what your shields/seals look like!\n\nThe conical part is the right idea!\n\nHeat set inserts are very strong, in my experience.  Not super enthused about tapping 3DPs, though.\n\nWhen you push on the roller, the bolt tries to rotate relative to the pulley.  This applies compressive stresses in the bore of the aluminum (or 3DP pulley bore).  If the bolt surface is threaded, its pretty easy to smoosh them into plastic and make the bore bigger/sloppier/damaged.  Smooth metal is MUCH harder to smash in to the bore due to much lower stress concentration.  The closer the fit, the lower the stress concentration.\n\nHope that helps…",

What’s the rationale for using that over what I currently have?\n\nEh, my point wasn’t so much that one design is better or worse, more that the design space has a whole lot of dimensions, and there are lots of different, good, solutions within it, depending on what you need.\n\nyou’ve listed low mass and easy assembly as criteria, but i’m sure there are other criteria, e.g. tolerance for friction, stiffness in various directions, strength in various directions, manufacturability, etc, so it’s good to think about those too.  i think in general FRC designs tend to have more parts than they need, and less stiffness than they could have, so that might be good to think about too.\n\nfor example, if the rest of your assembly needs some way to, say, keep the side plates aligned with respect to each other, then it sure is tempting to try to solve that problem as part of this roller design, using stiffer fittings, or even a full dead axle.\n\nif i had to compare your design to some in the link i shared, i’d suggest that the cantilever stiffness of the pin, relative to its mount, will be lower, which might be a problem and might not, depending on the rest of the assembly and what it does.  the stiffness also relies on the tightness of the bolt, and there’s not a good way to make that bolt really really tight, because it’s small in diameter and because it threads into a plastic part.  i think in general it’s good to know if your joint needs to be rigid (in which case it should probably be more rigid than this design) or if it can be free in some ways (in which case this design could be simplified a bit).  This design has the sort of “in between” character that i think sometimes means that this issue hasn’t been fully explored.\n\nalso, as others have mentioned, it is not possible to disassemble without moving the side-plates slightly, which is usually inconvenient.",
