The MIT Rocket Team website also provided valuable insights. A simple mass budget calculator was developed in Google Sheets, targeting an initial prototype weighing less than 500 grams. The project will utilize an Odrive S1 motor and a CAN Controller Area Network (CAN) to USB-C adapter. All components must fit within a 98mm (from Apogee Rockets) blue tube airframe powered by a high-energy 4-cell lithium polymer battery with the highest milliampere-hour (mAh) rating remaining in the weight budget. Links to additional resources or a weight budget chart can be shared upon request. For my current inquiry, I am seeking recommendations for CNC machining services similar to PCBWay, evaluating their effectiveness, and exploring alternative options. Specifically, I am interested in machining services for flywheels or reaction wheels, with potential consideration for 3D printing parts such as screws or metal components.",

The total weight is officially under 500 grams, excluding the airframe and wiring. Batteries alone are expected to account for approximately 99 grams, leaving room for additional weight from wiring and airframe components. Now, regarding your questions:\n\nAre there any good 4S LiPOS options available in the 850-1200mAh range that you’ve used before? If not, are there any lightweight wires you or your team commonly use? Additionally, do you have any specific filament types that you particularly prefer? Lastly, is there any restriction on using PETG or PLA for the mounting bracket?",
