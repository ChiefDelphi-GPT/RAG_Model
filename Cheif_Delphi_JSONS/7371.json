                    "cooked": "Coding mentor who is struggling with some of the finer points of PID and control systems, as opposed to just code.\n\nWe are trying to replicate our MotionMagic “DriveStraight” code from prior years using the new Phoenix6 APIs and Kraken/TalonFX motors/controllers.\n\nWe don’t yet have our Pigeon IMU, so I am trying to figure out how to do this only using the integrated encoders and the SimpleDifferentialMechanism class, which seems to be just what we need. The problem is that I am not sure I understand the usage exactly and we are getting no response when we try to call setControl…\n\nUsing a simple MotionMagic PID on just one TalonFX, I can get it to “Drive” to a distance, so I think the general MM PID is okay. I am just not sure how to set it up for Differential.\n\nSample config code for PID :\n\nWe set up a similar config for the other side (using the first side’s CAN ID for the DifferentialTalonFXSensor).\n\nThe call to try to make the drivetrain drive straight is:\n\nThis doesn’t work. I guessed that it was because we didn’t have the PID for the differential defined, so we configured Slot1 with the same gains as a test.\n\nWe get no response at all when we try to make the mechanism go a couple rotations, whereas with just the target and the MotionMagic on one side it does follow the motion profile.\n\nI am sure we’re missing something simple/dumb, but I am completely failing at finding it. Any help is appreciated. I don’t have the entire robot code public right now, but I can share bits as needed. We still use TimedRobot, so our code is relatively simplistic.\n\nUPDATE: We added a bunch of diagnostic calls and it appears that our “Add” TalonFX is somehow losing it’s setting for the “Differential Sensor” which is the TalonFX on the other side of the bot. I can set it in Phoenix tuner and see it gets cleared for some reason. Our code does set it, but only on init of the drivetrain, so I think we’re getting an error somewhere and it is clearing it. Still puzzled why we get no output at all – not even a single cycle.",

Any time we set the DifferentialSensor to the remote Talon, we get a Fault that it can’t be seen even though in Phoenix Tuner X it appears to be fine and watching its position through Tuner X we can see it change with manual changes. Any time we try to do something via the DifferentialSensor construct we get the Fault_MissingDifferentialFX signaling. We do not understand why we’re getting this.\n\nWe have checked all wires and tried reversing sides and we get this error no matter what. We have figured out that this is a sticky fault and have cleared that, but it comes back every time we try to use the DifferentialSensor using the remote TalonFX.\n\nAny help from someone who knows anything about this would be most appreciated.",

A SimpleDifferentialMechanism runs a control mode on the “average” axis, which essentially controls forward/backward movement, and a position closed-loop on the “differential” axis, driving the difference between the two motors to a fixed value.\n\nWhen you construct a SimpleDifferentialMechanism, all devices must be on the same CAN bus. Additionally, make sure the motorDirectionsAlign parameter is correctly set. If the two sides should have the same invert, this should be true ; otherwise, it should be false .\n\nTypically, slot 0 is used for the average axis PID (such as Motion Magic or a velocity closed-loop), while slot 1 is used for the differential axis PID . Make sure the slot numbers are correctly set up in your control request.\n\nAfter applying all configs to both motors except the DifferentialSensorsConfigs , call m_diffMechanism.applyConfigs() to apply the differential configs. We automatically set everything up so the correct leader/follower relationship is established.\n\nI would recommend starting off with open-loop control mode such as DifferentialDutyCycle to just make sure that everything is set up correctly and to tune your differential axis PID . Then you can work on using closed-loop for the average axis.\n\nWe also have an optional periodic() method that can be called from your subsystem periodic() to automatically disable output for important fault conditions, such as the other differential device disconnecting from the CAN bus. Some faults, such as a device power-cycling, requires manual user action followed by a call to clearUserRequirement() to restore the system to a safe state, while others can be automatically recovered from. We have several APIs to get the current state of the mechanism and the reason for a disable/required user action.",

Unfortunately, we’re still struggling, so hoping you can maybe help further.\n\nAfter working with a past coder to get a sim working and using our Pigeon for Yaw instead of just encoders and getting it to work there, we’ve tried putting it back on our bot and we’re still getting the MissingDifferentialFX fault when we call SetControl on the SimpleDifferentialMechaism.\n\nI’ve tried reviewing all the things you’ve pointed out and I believe we are constructing the object correctly and we’re trying to use the PID values for our position PID that seemed to work when just using one side of the drivetrain to move to a specified number of rotations. The turn PID is not tuned for this bot but is based on a prior incarnation of a similar method (using phoenix 5 and falcons/talonFX w/ pigeon)\n\nIf I manually clear the faults using Phoenix tuner (or whatever the new incarnation is called) and plot the MissingDifferentialFX fault and the sticky MissingDifferentialFX fault, they are 0. As soon as we call SetControl on the SimpleDifferentialMechanism both plots change to a value of 1. If we just use a WPI DifferentialDrive and arcade drive the drivetrain all of the motor controllers respond normally and in phoenix tuner we don’t have any issues with the CAN bus so I don’t believe we have a signalling issue with one controller not being able to signal another. I’m stumped.\n\nOur code is public at frc5567/2024-Robot: Competition Robot code for 2024 (github.com) Please look at the “SimpleDiff” branch for the current incarnation of our test code (literally using the “Test” mode to call the drivestraight method on the Drivetrain). Forgive any stylistic issues, please. The code is a work in progress and is student written and maintained (I’m just to blame for it working or not).",

However, after doing a quick code review of firmware, I did find an issue that could cause the MissingDifferentialFX fault you are seeing. I do not have an expected ETA of when we will release firmware with the fix (since I’m at university right now), but hopefully it will be picked up in the next release.",

We had been using Voltage in our PID tests, but on the sim DutyCycle was used. Sorry about that.\n\nGood to know about the Feedback configs – that will be valuable going forward.\n\nFinally, I am glad to hear (at least in this regard) that I’m not just crazy and there is something funky in the firmware. That was the conclusion I had kind of arrived at, but we couldn’t figure out how to find the code to verify further. For the time being we are doing a simplified position PID (just do it on both sides of the drivetrain with no feedback between) to accomplish what we need for the first comp. We’ll revisit the Differential mechanism once a fix for the firmware has been released.\n\nAgain, thank you very much for your responses and your time. Overall, we are liking Phoenix 6 a LOT for the way it has simplified many things and made some of the constructs more consistent. Kudos to the team overall.",
