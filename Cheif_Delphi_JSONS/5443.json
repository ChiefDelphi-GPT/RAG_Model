                    "cooked": "Hi CD , In the spring I gradated from high school and from my Robotics team frc2877 .  As part of LigerBots I acquired hundreds of hours of experience in Onshape making all sorts of robot related things as the team as a designer since 2021 and the Design Lead for the 2024 season. I also designed various things for 3d printing for both personal and work related. I am now in my first week of college as a mechanical engineering student at Wentworth Institute of Technology in Boston. I have some personal projects that I could relatively easily model in Onshape but I want to practice using Solidworks because that is what my college uses.\n\nI am wondering if people have any tips or resources for someone coming from Onshape to Solidworks. I have seen there are a lot of resources for people going to Onshape from Solidworks but nothing the other way around. I have heard that “it is just button are in different places” but on my first poke around there seem to be key differences in the basic workflow(sketches) and often used hotkeys. I have not dug in deep at all and if this is just something that I will figure out after a few hours of use just let me know. But any advice and tips would be appreciated to help transition with less frustration.\n\n2024 Shooter image 1327×631 70.1 KB Outreach Robot Intake+transfer image 1053×784 67.7 KB Mini Robot CAD project image 993×790 102 KB Hydrogen powered car + parts library of a summer program I taught at image 778×683 63.5 KB Camera Mount for my 3D-Printer image 1565×630 70 KB\n\nimage 1327×631 70.1 KB\n\nimage 1327×631 70.1 KB\n\nimage 1053×784 67.7 KB\n\nimage 1053×784 67.7 KB\n\nimage 993×790 102 KB\n\nimage 993×790 102 KB\n\nimage 778×683 63.5 KB\n\nimage 778×683 63.5 KB\n\nimage 1565×630 70 KB\n\nimage 1565×630 70 KB\n\nPS If there are any cool features that Solidworks has that Onshape does not let me know.",

You’re at the point where you have to break habits and assumptions and you aren’t used to the things that often differ between programs. Don’t beat yourself up over the difficulty and just keep at it.\n\nSolidWorks does not have a good hotkey setup by default. Head over to Tools > Customize > Keyboard to configure it how you want. You can also completely customize the toolbar layout and appearance from the same window. Spend some time getting both of these how you like them.\n\nDon’t mind the fact that the default feature tree elements are in German. Corporate templates and all that…\n\nScreenshot 2024-09-06 120408 1920×1040 202 KB\n\nScreenshot 2024-09-06 120408 1920×1040 202 KB\n\nScreenshot 2024-09-06 120408 1920×1040 202 KB\n\nYes, I have toolbars on all four sides of the window.\n\nElliotS:\n\nPS If there are any cool features that Solidworks has that Onshape does not let me know.\n\nHere are a few bits and bobs that come to mind:\n\nIt’s not exactly a feature , but really try to get comfortable with all of SolidWorks’ options for mates, including the Advanced and Mechanical tabs. In particular, options like Symmetric, Width, and Slot don’t have exact one-to-one equivalents in Onshape but are frequently extremely useful.\n\nSolidWorks’ Mirror Components is very featureful. It gives you the ability to control instance-by-instance which items get new mirrored configurations and which can be reused by being rotated in the proper orientation. It can be easy to miss because that functionality is hidden behind a next page arrow in the top right corner of the PropertyManager pane when the feature is active.\n\nA general word of advice: there are a lot of features buried in the Insert dropdown above the ribbon that I often forget about. Check there whenever you need to do something special.\n\nI would encourage anyone using Onshape to (at least temporarily) switch your mouse controls to the SolidWorks layout. This is one of the alternatives you can select under My Account > Preferences > Mouse Controls. Not only do I actually like it better on its own merits, it will give you a slightly easier transition later if you (as many aspiring engineers do) end up having to learn SolidWorks in college. (In SolidWorks, right-click-and-drag is used to quick snap to standard views rather than rotate.) You can also check the box for “Set default rotation behavior to constrained rotate,” which is, in my opinion, a huge QoL improvement that is far too buried. In SolidWorks, the same option is enabled with Right Click in whitespace > Rotate About Scene Floor.",

                    "cooked": "Here are a couple BIG takeaways coming from an engineer that uses Solidworks at work and Onshape at robotics:\n\nFile Structure\n\nOnshape is neat because everything is in the cloud, with all of the benefits that brings\n\nSolidworks is a more standard software that uses local files on your computer\n\nThese files include Part, Assembly, and Drawing files\n\nThese files behave differently than Onshape does, which I get into more below\n\nSaving Work\n\nOne strong downside to Solidworks is that it relies on manual saving of work just like any other file-based software\n\nThere is a periodic auto-save functionality and reminders to save your work, but it is definitely not as clean and reliable as the Onshape method of saving every single action taken in the document no matter what\n\nAt some point, you will almost certainly lose some work in Solidworks due to a crash after having not saved for a while\n\nI’m sorry\n\nMates\n\nMates are a contentious topic between Onshape and most other CAD programs\n\nI personally prefer Solidworks Mates from an ease of use perspective, but there are legitimate reasons for the Onshape strategy\n\nIn Onshape, you only apply one mate between two parts, and that mate handles eliminating all degrees of freedom (i.e. Fastened Mate), except the ones you intend to leave free (all the others)\n\nIn Solidworks, each mate eliminates a certain number and type of degrees of freedom, and you will almost always require 2 or 3 mates to fully constrain a part\n\nThe “lock” mate does maintain orientation and position between two parts with one mate, but it is rarely used\n\nGroups (Or Lack Thereof)\n\nThat “lock” mate may sound a lot like the “group and fix” strategy often used in Onshape\n\nThis strategy is not great for Solidworks, mainly because it does not have the functionality of Part Studios to maintain parametric relationships for the locations and orientations between parts\n\nIn Onshape, you can insert a collection of parts from a Part Studio, then group them together and fix or mate one of them in the Assembly\n\nWhen you then change the part studio, the locations of all of those parts relative to each other will also update in the Assembly\n\nThere is no practical way to mimic this in Solidworks, so instead you are always expected to mate each part in a way that restricts all degrees of freedom that you don’t want to remain for mechanical purposes (linear sliding, rotation, etc.) After talking this through with our CAD admin at work, Multi-Body Parts can do this sort of this in Solidworks. However, the process for making Solidworks mimic the complete Onshape functionality has a lot more overhead to get right.\n\nFor this reason, the “lock” mate is seldom used in Solidworks except by people who want their assemblies break in weird ways\n\nMulti-Body Parts\n\nYou may have heard that you have to have a separate file for each different part in Solidworks\n\nFor many users and companies, this IS how it works, and designing this way makes inter-part parametric relationships effectively impossible\n\nHowever, Solidworks has two features that allow it to operate more like Onshape\n\nIn Solidworks Part files, you can design multiple bodies just like you can in Onshape Part Studios\n\nThese are called “Multi-Body Parts”\n\nOne downside is that you can’t insert a subset of the total bodies in a Multi-Body Part like you can when inserting from a Part Studio to an Assembly\n\nYou can get around this by creating multiple configurations of a Multi-Body Part with different bodies deleted, but this is cumbersome and I have never had a reason to do it this way\n\nAlso, some modeling tools in Solidworks are restricted to only modifying a single body, like the fillet and chamfer tools\n\nVirtual Parts\n\nThe other way to create multiple Parts at once are Virtual Parts, which are parts that exist only in an Assembly file instead of having their own Part file\n\nThese are useful when developing your ideas, because creating a Virtual Part is fast and doesn’t clutter up your file structure while you are unsure of the exact Part files your Assembly will need\n\nIn Assemblies, there are certain “Assembly Features” you can apply which are like Part Features but existing solely in the Assembly file\n\nThis is a useful tool to get similar inter-part parametric relationships to what you can get with Onshape Part Studios\n\nHowever, because most companies want to create a released version (also called a “Revision” or “Rev”) of specific part files that will not change, Assembly Features are not always a great choice.\n\nIf some of the features of a part are actually in an assembly and not the part file itself, then that part file can’t be used for revisioning, which makes official product releases much more complicated\n\nIn general, Multi-Body Parts, Virtual Parts, and Assembly Features are all inconvenient when working with a file management tool\n\nCollaboration\n\nThis is one of the ways that Onshape really kills Solidworks\n\nSolidworks has no way for different people to effectively make changes to the same file at the same time.\n\nInstead, if you need to collaborate with others, a PDM (Product Data Management) system is used\n\nPDM usually involves keeping a save of each “version” of a file\n\nTo make any change to the file, you must make a new version by first “checking out” the file\n\nThis tells other users that the file is being edited and prevents them from also checking it out\n\nOnce you are done making changes, you then “check in” the file to save a new version to your organizations network drive\n\nThis leads to a lot of room for problems, because unlike Onshape, the version history only has snapshots of the history only has snapshots of the changes to the part\n\nIf the user checked in a particular version doesn’t give good notes of what they changed, it can be very difficult to understand exactly what happened to the file\n\nIn summary, there are definitely a lot of differences that can trip users up when going from Onshape to Solidworks. I might even characterize that switch as harder than going in the other direction. However, Solidworks is still a capable CAD program. Given that it is by far the most common program used by small- and medium-sized companies, it is probably for the better than you are going to make this transition in a learning environment. Good luck!",

We’ll probably mainly be using assembly hole wizards to place the majority of screw holes in the future.\n\nAlso, virtual parts in assemblies can be saved as external files so that they exist in your file structure, just with the external relations already there. I’ve found this feature to be pretty useful when trying to work in a top-down workflow in SolidWorks.",

Right click on a subassembly and you can lock it’s components together or make them flexible relative to each other.\n\nThat’s another difference between the two programs. In Solidworks, when you bring an assembly into another assembly, it comes in “rigid” by default. This means it is static and has none of it’s degrees of freedom. Making it “flexible” recovers those degrees of freedom. This is different than Onshape, where bringing an assembly into another assembly retains the degrees of freedom by default (I’m not actually sure if you can make an assembly rigid in Onshape, per se)",

It allows you to gather all the files (parts, sub-assemblies, drawings, etc) related to the assembly into a single folder. This is important if you need to share the files with professor, or just can’t find all your files (as Solidworks lets you save files in any folder from what i remember).\n\nA big one from my time using it was to save and save often, because Solidworks will inevitably crash when you don’t and you will lose hours of work.\n\nIn general, learning a new CAD system really helps you learn how well you understand Parametric modeling as a whole. Part of the reason I like OnShape for FRC is that it isn’t an industry standard yet like Solidworks and Creo, so when you do learn it in school you know how to switch between programs, and can more easily transition to another program when the time comes. So far within FRC , college, and professionally, I’ve used Solidworks, Creo/Pro-E, SolidEdge, and Onshape.",
