                    "cooked": "Hey Everyone,\n\nWe are in the process of coding an LED subsystem (Candle) and we’re curious about the optimal way to structure the code. Does it make sense to:\n\nLeverage Dependency Injection and have our Intake/Vision System take in the LED system. Maybe through overloading the constructor (i.e., Intake(LEDSubsystem lights) as an overloaded constructor). This would give us access to the LED subsystem’s methods in the intake and vision subsystem and then we could periodically poll to see when we should apply a specific color changing method. Or maybe thinking about the inverse: the LED Subsystem’s constructor could parameterize BooleanSuppliers that reference the isGamePieceIndexed and is VisionAccepted. So, in the LED Subsystems Periodic we can constantly check those Boolean states and adjust the color as needed.\n\nLeverage Dependency Injection and have our Intake/Vision System take in the LED system.

By having the LED as a singleton we could access it as needed globally. Not sure if this is best practice, but this would let us periodically call the LED methods as needed from the other subsystems’ periodics.\n\nGlobal LED Subsystem or Singleton.

Not sure if this is best practice, but this would let us periodically call the LED methods as needed from the other subsystems’ periodics.\n\nTie it into the Command Scheduler. Do we keep the LED Subsystem and the others separate and have them only interact through Commands/Triggers. So, in Robot Container when a trigger is true, run commands from the LED Subsystem. Which reminds me, does a trigger using a certain subsystem Boolean-state interfere with other commands using/requiring the subsystem? So, if I want to assign the isPieceIndexed to a trigger that runs the LEDSetColorCommand, does that mess with another command running that requires the Intake subsystem?\n\nTie it into the Command Scheduler.

I want to make sure we’re practicing the best practices, coding consistency, and learning from this.\n\nI appreciate all input!",
