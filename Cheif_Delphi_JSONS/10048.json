The school has some makerbot printers we don’t use, so mentors currently use Prusa or other Creality printers for most of our printed parts, typically using PLA+.\n\nWe’d love to get reviews from FRC teams on bambu lab printers. I’ve heard a lot of great things about their performance and print quality, but I have also heard from folks like @AllenGregoryIV (who is a very reliable source) that they’ve had some service issues. So I’d love to hear from others about the following:\n\nWhich printer do you have?\n\nWhat material(s) do you typically print with?\n\nSuggested filaments/brands/product links for high strength materials (have you found anything similar to Onyx?)\n\nRate the print quality on a scale of 1-10 with 10 being perfection\n\nPrint speeds you are able to run\n\nBuild quality or service issues?\n\nThanks in advance!",

But I do hear reports (reddit, bambu forums) of some people getting lemons. And if you get a lemon then I hear their support is good but takes time. A MK3S+, if you get a lemon you can usually fix it yourself with the help of Prusa support. My X1C prints at twice the speed of the MK3S+ Mostly print PLA but PETG hasn’t been an issue. I haven’t printed any of their exotics like ABS, PC, TPU, PA/PET On mine print quality is fantastic and is on par with my Prusa. That being said, personally, I’d get another. But I’ll probably get a MK4 in 6 months or so once all the 1st gen bugs are worked out because I just want one",

You can replace these with hardened steel linear rods and that fixes that problem. Also, there will be false positive and false negative trips with the “AI Camera” feature. Lastly, you need to keep everything lubricated and check all your bearings on a regular (monthly?) basis.\n\nI have had this printer running pretty much non stop for about a month now, and I researched failure modes very extensively to be prepared.",

                    "cooked": "First off, I love mine. I’m a life long bed slinger naysayer, and the Bambu checks all the boxes for me. I’ve already got a few kit/diy printers, and the open it and start printing aspect has been a boon to my personal and our team usage of 3d printing. 401 also has a Markforged Onyx Pro, although the horribly long print times, and arguably over inflated material costs, limit our usage of it.\n\nI preordered a X1 Carbon Combo back in early November, and got it right at the end of Nov. Also got one of each of the extruders, and bed plates along with some spares. Parts are just so cheap it’s hard not to buy 3x at a time. Whole extruder assembly’s are $30! We almost entirely use the Bambu PEI bed plate, and as long as you keep it clean with dawn and hot water, everything sticks well and pops right off with a flex of the plate.\n\nWe’ve been printing PETG almost entirely, along with 1-2 rolls of ABS, a small amount of PLA, and some other more niche filaments. We’ve had zero issue with the 20-30KG of PETG we’ve printed so far, both on .4 and .6mm. We like petg as it has decent strength and pretty low cost. As for brands, honestly I just buy what I see on sale via 3dprintingdeals, which has included HZST3D, KINLUOT, Geeetech, and GiantArm, all the normal cheap filament companies. No issues whatsoever with any of them.\n\nWe’ve also used CC3D Polycarbonate, GiantArm TPU, PRILINE PC-CF, Polymaker PA6-CF, and iSANGHU PETG-CF. All without issue, although I wouldn’t necessarily say they are on par with Onyx as we haven’t done any side by side testing. Although Bambu’s new PAHT-CF looks really good, but we haven’t had a need for it. The .6 hardened nozzle is great for the CF filaments, and I haven’t had any clogs or the like so far. The TPU is as finicky as it would be on any printer, but there’s some bambu subreddit posts with great settings.\n\nI’ll say if you’re just using the generic profiles, automatic flow calibration, and not aiming for perfection, parts are a solid 8.5/10 in quality. You can very easily get that last 1.5 if you get into the weeds and do a small amount of custom tuning for each brand and type of filament, as you would with any other printer. There’s a fork of the Bambu slicer, OrcaSlicer (formerly SoftFever) that has some built in calibration models and tools, as well as unlock all the settings across the board. We honestly haven’t had time or motivation to go much beyond the generic material profiles, and we just really haven’t needed to. since they work great as is.\n\nOne note on automatic flow cal, it’s not supposed to be used on the textured PEI bed, although it does work, it messes a little with the feed forward and makes seams more pronounced. Once we switched to doing the cal on a smooth bed, seams cleaned up immensely.\n\nI can’t comment on speeds with actual numbers, as again we’ve just used defaults, but I’ll say it’s at least 2-3x faster than generic ender3’s, and 5+x faster than the Markforged.\n\nThe only service issue we’ve really had is that the belts started to wear in/stretch with the first 3 months of use, and I had to do the belt tensioning procedure. We noticed some holes coming out ovular, and the belt procedure takes less than five minutes to completely fix it. Otherwise things like nozzle swaps are crazy fast, just two bolts. If you get an AMS print out this guy , super helpful. Build quality is rock solid in my opinion, just make sure you put it on something stable because it moves QUICK.\n\nAdditionally, no matter which model you get, I cannot recommend the AMS enough. The automatic material failover in itself is so helpful to burn up those last few bits of spools. Plus multi-color is really neat. You do have to rewind or print the guards for cardboard spools, but that’s not a huge deal, and the Hydra AMS mod help a big with weird sized spools.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions, I think I covered everything in this little brain dump.",

With the price increase in the MarkForge Onyx One, we can purchase 4 X1Cs for the price of one MarkForge.  Curious if anyone has tried the PAHT-CF filament on the X1C.  Is the quality and strength comparable to prints with Onyx?  Can the X1C serve as a replacement for the MarkForge?",

However, for tougher filaments I have had more luck with the mk3s. While I haven’t used the Bambu labs carbon filament, 3dxtech makes great carbon filaments, and I have been able to print multiple with high success, by just changing the thermistor and having a solid enclosure. I would recommend running dual power supplies for the mk3 if you are running carbon. However, when comparing desktop fdm carbon filaments to onyx, there is a clear and distinct difference in quality and strength. Getting the same layer adhesion and stability that the markforged is able to achieve is extremely difficult. That being said, the price is hard to justify. I have had to work with both customer service lines, and while prusa’s was much more helpful, parts take forever if it is something more proprietary. It’s gotten better with aftermarket parts, but it still is risky compared to the real thing. I would be happy to share more about my experience printing carbon filament if you are interested(only with the mk3, not the p1p).",

The AMS is an incredible bit of kit as well\n\nThey just announced a P1S which is enclosed and should easily handle even the spiciest of filaments like CF-Nylon and other engineering grade stuff without all the bells like LiDAR and a touchscreen that the X1 has.\n\nAt the cost, that’s for sure the printer I would recommend to literally anyone.",

I might float the idea of selling our Markforged Onyx Pro since we hardly ever use the fiberglass feature. In the rare instance we wanted to use fiber or carbon filament embedded in Onyx, we could outsource. We still would have an Onyx One that works great, & with the proceeds from the Onyx Pro we could buy some number of Bambus.",
