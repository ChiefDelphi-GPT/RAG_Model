What should I look at when it comes to getting that fast and snappy movement?\n\nAnd some other things that I want to clear up:\n\nHow much does profiling help to achieve this snappy movement? Should I be using Motion Magic for this? Or a profiledPID controller + feed forward\n\nHow much of a difference does it make with feed forward compared to not using it?\n\nOur subsystems are 2 stage elevator and an pivoting arm.\n\nFYI we use CIMs and VictorSPXs and REV through bore encoders",

It does not run any form of PID - it is a simple variant of a trapezoidal profile where it ramps up to a max speed over a set time (something like 0.1s), and cruises at that max speed until the error * gain curve intersects with the max speed. The speed then reduces following the error * gain curve down.\n\nHere’s a video of the elevator in motion:\n\nGoogle Drive file.\n\nAnd this is a graph of our motion: The purple line is error*gain, the yellow line command to the motor (-100 to 100%), and the blue line is position feedback. Note that this was before feedforward was added so there’s some bouncing at the position.\n\nScreenshot_20250319_123445_Slack 1080×1162 92.4 KB\n\nScreenshot_20250319_123445_Slack 1080×1162 92.4 KB\n\nScreenshot_20250319_123445_Slack 1080×1162 92.4 KB\n\nNote how the yellow ramps up to 100%, cruises at 100%, then “rides down” with the purple error*gain",

Or a profiledPID controller + feed forward\n\nIt accounts for a lot . Using a motion profile makes most tuning issues trivial, and is absolutely worth using, even if you have poor tuning involved. Even with bad tunings, you’ll end up with Good Enough control almost immediately, and can improve from there for speed, precision, and stability. Motion Magic in particular is lauded as being “actually magic” for how well it generates this motion.\n\nThe key insight here is that a PID controller tends to handle poorly when you have large setpoint changes: EG, going from 0 inches to 40 inches. These changes generates a large output spike, which grinds gears and stresses your robot and makes things move very quickly. While you can tune your I and D terms to combat this, unless you’re very good at it, it’s a very iterative, slow, process that’s easy to get wrong and cause really nasty motions. Using a motion profile makes these setpoint changes much smaller, meaning your PID control never generates huge spikes in output to begin with, and the robot behaves pretty well even with poor PID and feedforward tunings. From here you mostly have to get your basic FeedForwards (especially kg), and you’ll have a robot that can be easily misconstrued as well tuned.",

                    "cooked": "Something important to consider when building a mechanism that you hope to make fast and snappy (which functionally translates to high acceleration, high velocity, high positional accuracy) is a mechanical system that is very light, but is still very rigid and tightly actuated mechanically.  By that I mean:\n\nAssuming all else is constant (same motor,same gear reduction mostly):\n\nLight: Lighter systems can be accelerated and decelerated more quickly/with less torque.\n\nRigid: A rigid system will not flex noticeably when subjected to forces due to acceleration (bending beams where rigging/ropes/belts are attached to it). It is build strong enough to withstand the high forces involved in being accelerated or decelerated very quickly.  Assuming you’re using very strong motors, it’s totally possible that you could set your acceleration and velocities high enough that your mechanism could destroy itself while trying to accelerate faster than the structure can handle.  F=MA.\n\nA rigid system has tight (but not too tight) belts/ropes/rigging such that there is not slack that needs to be taken up before the system actually starts moving.  When it comes to a stop the system doesn’t bounce or overshoot its setpoint because of slop/slack in the rigging/belts/ropes.\n\nI’m sure there are other considerations, but these are lessons learned on our team from this year so I’m speaking from recent experience.\n\nTuning is great, and can make a properly built mechanism into a screaming fast machine, but if the system is not robust enough for such speeds and accelerations, no amount of tuning is going to fix that.\n\nGood luck!",
