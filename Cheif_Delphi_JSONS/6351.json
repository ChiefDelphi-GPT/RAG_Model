This kind of system involves building a mathematical model for the gravity and air dynamics of the projectiles and finding the best trajectory.\n\nScreenshot 2024-08-04 014758 1784×909 74.2 KB\n\nScreenshot 2024-08-04 014758 1784×909 74.2 KB\n\nScreenshot 2024-08-04 014758 1784×909 74.2 KB\n\nimage 1029×264 91.6 KB These are, without a doubt, awesome and cool projects.\n\nimage 1029×264 91.6 KB\n\nimage 1029×264 91.6 KB\n\nOn the other hand, most teams use simple aiming mechanisms that have also worked fine.  For example, we find the most optimized shooter state from different distances by trial and error, then do a linear interpolation.  If the robot is moving, we also approximate the flight time using linear interpolation and aim at a “ghost target” about 0.3~0.8 seconds ahead.\n\nAlthough more accurate, there are a few disadvantages to using physics-based. Including:\n\nThere is no way to validate your model .  Think about system identification , it knows all the data relevant to its mechanism model (voltage, position, velocity, acceleration…) and validates the model using goodness-of-fit-metrics . image 542×637 75.7 KB But for an air-dynamics model of the projectile, you never know whether your model is correct, nor do you know that your constants are accurate.  Because you don’t have something like this in your workshop. image 1280×712 78.7 KB\n\nThere is no way to validate your model .

We all have the experience, where a system that works perfectly fine on your practice field happens to not work in the competition field, or something that works last match happens to not work in the next match.   In these “unhappy situations”, I would rather be tuning this: Screenshot 2024-08-04 013743 893×94 3.76 KB and not these: | Screenshot 2024-08-04 013858 878×198 67.2 KB Although the latter is a much more appropriate and sense-making model.

Most of a shooter’s performance is purely mechanical (stiffness, energy transfer, backdrivability), and you aren’t gonna get a whole lotta perofrmace with a physics model you can develop in an FRC build season. In the time it would take to write and validate a physics model, you could’ve already tuned a lerp solution and consistently nail the goal. Unlike physics-based models for controls, air drag for shooting is extremely hard to model and matters for shots and can only be solved using expensive numerical methods like the shooting method, which you really don’t want to be running on your robot.\n\nBeing able to adjust shooter values mid-comp is also extremely important, whether it be from gamepiece variability ( FRC 2024, FTC 2021), air pressure ( FRC 2022), or game piece wear (many, most notably FRC 2020)",

It’s what we’d typically call a “nonparametric” model, which is a bit of a misnomer because in reality it has many more parameters (each entry in the lookup table…) than a “parametric” model.  In nonparametric models, it is generally difficult to interpret the individual parameters - but in no sense are they nonphysical.",

This could involve simply introducing some extra parameters on top of your empirically tuned shooter map to account for the increased air resistance when shooting on the fly.\n\nI would start with the simplest possible solution and iterate your approach as you notice room for improvement.",
