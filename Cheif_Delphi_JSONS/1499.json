For development with these boards, i using EasyEDA (free and dinamic learning), but I heard that Altium has more tools (accepting tips please).\n\nIf any team develops such boards and can mention practical applications in projects, I would be very grateful!",

                    "cooked": "It is! There’s some regulations for small electronics, and in many cases boards qualify as “passive conductors”.\n\nWe’ve developed boards for a few things over the years: Small breakout boards for motor controller dataports to latching 3 wire connectors, LED boards for ring lights (back in retroreflective days), LED boards to connect up to the CAN bus,  and CAN terminators. A very common place to see them is plug boards to make connecting things to the roborio more reliable.\n\nOnce you have some skills here, its easy to get tiny little boards in places that streamline connections and add robustness.\n\nFor actual development, I would recommend Kicad. It’s free, open source, and extremely capable with more advanced features. The workflow is non-obvious (which is common for pcb design tooling), but there’s a lot of community guides, and a excellent component library which make things pretty streamlined once you get the workflow down. It also happens to have some extremely powerful features that reduce oversight and errors as you increase your design complexities.\n\nPro tools like Altium might be more widely used in industry, but the downside is complexity and lack of good, free options. This reduces the ability to update and modify files long term, or in the broader frc community, and makes it tricky to get help in general.\n\nA fun historical PCB for vision is the Gloworm: A complimentary hardware platform to make running Photonvision more limelight-like. Didn’t exactly take off, but I still run one of these on my testbench bot to have stable 5V power to my Orange Pi. https://photonvision.github.io/gloworm-docs/posts/announcing-gloworm/",

One is entirely passive and just breaks out the RoboRio connections to connectors that are easier to use in the pits and more secure during collisions.\n\nThe second is mostly passive in that it serves as a breakout board for CAN , plus the +12V, +5V, and GND “buses” for low-current devices (CANCoders, OrangePi, etc.) That gives a JST-XH semi-locking connector with 5 pins carrying +12V, GND, +5V, CAN -H, and CAN -L, plus has a breakout to some 3-pin connections for voltmeters to monitor the bus. (We only use those on one of the boards, though they’re present on all.)\n\nI say that one is mostly passive, because it does have PTC/polyfuse protections on each connector and for each power rail. That way, a small overcurrent on one connected device will take just that device offline, and a large overcurrent will do the same hopefully before tripping the large circuit breaker.\n\nBut most importantly, it provides for fast troubleshooting and module replacement in the pits without worrying about the wires.\n\nI second the recommendation for KiCAD. It’s been good for a long time, but KiCAD 8 (and 9 was just released) are really pleasant to use. We use JLCPCB and I’m happy with them, though other suppliers are also probably quite good.",
