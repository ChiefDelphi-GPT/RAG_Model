                    "cooked": "Hi, Team 2530 here. This past week, we started programming for our off-season prototype elevator, and it’s the first time we’ve ever used NEO Vortices and SPARK Flexes. Thanks to WPILIB simulation, we got the elevator up and running pretty quickly, but after running it for a while, we noticed some peculiar issues.\n\n95% of the time, the elevator functions as intended (profiled PID + feedforward moves the elevator to presets), but occasionally while the elevator is moving between presets, the elevator abruptly stops for a short period of time (about 0.1sec from our testing). We have determined that this is not likely a mechanical issue (it occurs even when both elevator motors are not connected to the elevator and can spin freely). Using AdvantageScope, we can see that during at the times when the elevator abruptly stops, there is a mismatch between the duty cycle we are giving to the elevator motors (with .set() ), and the duty cycle the motor controller is outputting (obtained with .getAppliedOutput() ). The motor is being set() to a non-zero throttle, but the output duty cycle is zero. Looking at slow-motion video of the motor controller status LED when this issue occurs, we can see that the LED turns blue for a split second when this happens (both motors are in brake mode, so it makes sense that the motors would enter brake mode when they are at 0 duty).\n\nThis is a screenshot of AdvantageScope showing a normal operation of the elevator, followed by a single occurrence of the issue (19.5s to 20s). The red line is the intended motion profile, yellow is the elevator position (measured from the encoder of one of the elevator motors), the light-blue line is the duty cycle we are giving to the motors (with .set() ), purple and peach lines are the motor’s output duty (from .getAppliedOutput() ). As you can see, the elevator abruptly stops twice during this graph (at about 19.75s, and just before 20.0s). issue_graph_image 1502×525 47.8 KB\n\nissue_graph_image 1502×525 47.8 KB\n\nissue_graph_image 1502×525 47.8 KB\n\nIf anyone has any theories on what might be the root cause of this issue, or any pointers on how to debug this better, we would love to know!\n\nAdditional information:\n\nWe are using REVLib 2024.2.4\n\nRoboRIO 2.0, REV PDH\n\nFor debugging purposes, our CAN loop contains only the two elevator SPARK Flex motor controllers, the roboRIO, and the REV PDH (termination set to “on”)\n\nThe code we are running can be found here (“Elevator” branch, subsystems/ElevatorSubsystem.java contains the elevator code)\n\nBoth elevator SPARK Flexes have been updated to the most recent firmware version.",

When enabling the first time in duty cycle mode, the applied output is correct and current draw is small. Velocity control also works as expected with no motion. When switching back to duty cycle mode, the applied output oscillates very rapidly. This causes the mechanism (a swerve drive wheel in this case) to rapidly oscillate, and the current draw is very high.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58ccb9df-95ea-4849-9be7-f1458267f105)\n\nWhen zooming in on the third enable, you can see that the Spark Max runs at the correct duty cycle only for very short periods of time (1ms as it appears in the log with 1ms sampling).\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe29fdc4-2884-480e-b1eb-0163326d3adf)\n\nThis behavior is not perfectly consistent. Below is an example where I cycle between velocity and duty cycle control several times. Often, the oscillation is much less severe when switching back to duty cycle control (you can see occasional jumps and slightly higher current draw). However, I can reliably get the extreme oscillation by swapping back and forth many times (as in this example).\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/109a20a8-5a49-48b3-b1d8-a8c8648f4176)\n\nSome other observations:\n* This occurs when switching from velocity control to either duty cycle or voltage control, but not switching from position control to either of the others. \n* It can be temporarily fixed by restarting robot code, but not by reconfiguring devices with the same code running.\n* When the code is started/restarted, enabling first in duty cycle/voltage control works properly but switching to velocity control as any point causes it to return (as shown in the screenshots).\n* After the extreme oscillation has occurred once, it seems much more likely to repeat when enabled subsequently.\n* If the example code is adjusted to include an arbitrary FF value, the oscillation is between the correct duty cycle output and the arbitrary FF value (the other PID gains are 0).\n\nI've tested this on several Spark Max devices running `2025.0.0-prerelease.6`, though not a Spark Flex.
