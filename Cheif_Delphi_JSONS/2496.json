We plan to switch from daisy chaining to a star can wiring system, where each device has its own can wire route, and a break in the loop does not spell disaster for the entire robot that match.\n\nAre there any good terminals that we should use to split the wire into a terminal for multiple connections (if this makes any sense; like where the central can wire splits off to connect to each device in the can network)? Thanks",

The problem you’re having with a break in the loop causing headaches is mostly mitigated by the standard CAN layout, but I can see how a large trunk can have that issue arise.\n\nThings like the CAN leads for the Spark Max support this topology, so one module having an issue shouldn’t shut things down.\n\nYou’re also going to get comments from the camp of “star topology still works, and even though it doesn’t meet CAN requirements”, which is a camp I can empathize with. For the most part, our CAN networks are pretty minimal, and we may not see the downfalls of not following documentation.\n\nI’ve seen teams on CD using custom PCBs to create a star topology, and if you’re serious about going that path, I would highly recommend that. Maybe one of them can (humor) provide some insight on their findings with Star.\n\nEdit: Important to note that I was trained on the standard CAN for my professional life before it became an FRC thing to me. I have no harsh judgement with either topology, I just want teams to use what works best for them.",

It’s not guaranteed that you will see issues past that length, but be aware that what you are doing is explicitly unsupported. For CAN FD, as the CTRE Canivore uses, there is not a safe length for a stub and you should avoid star topology altogether. Instead of spending the time figuring out star, I’d instead focus on why your CAN bus has been failing, and improve that. Was it a connector issue? - etc",

CAN requires 120Ω terminations on two ends, and having multiple ends might create unwanted behavior. You can access the full CAN spec here: https://www.ti.com/lit/an/slla270/slla270.pdf , I’m mostly drawing from page 7.\n\nSecondly, even with a star topology, there’s always a single point of failure. If the RoboRIO gets disconnected, you’ll lose all connectivity. Now, with a bus topology, there are more single points of failure, but there will always be at least one .\n\nNow that I think about it - I’m curious what everyone thinks about this topology:\n\nI mean, it’s got two terminations, but relies on unspecified behavior by the CAN standard.

My main tips would be:\n\nMake sure your main trunk is protected. It doesn’t help with reliability if your main trunk gets smushed by another robot or your own mechanism snags it.\n\nMake sure your stubs off the main branch are not too long. This includes the additional length off the other side of the device. It’s going to feel wrong, but one of the two ends of the CAN on your motors has to be cut extremely short.\n\nGet good quality connectors\n\nDon’t use wagos as splitters, get an open barrel crimp and crimp 2+ wires together for your split.",

SWYFT CANnect revolutionizes your setup by allowing you to run CAN bus and 12V Power over standard Ethernet cables. This drastically reduces wiring...\n\nPrice: USD 39.99\n\nRelatively expensive but reliable and convenient.  Just be sure to hot glue the ethernet cables into their ports after all connections are made.  We had zero CAN issues all season.\n\nEdit - this is trunk and branch, at least visually.  I presume a star arrangement is essentially the same as a trunk and branch where the trunk is shrunk down to a single connection point (a splitter).\n\nFor the CANnect modules, the Ethernet cabling acts as the trunk and the Wago connections for CAN are where the short branches to your devices tie in.  Worked great for our swerve drive and other connections in the base.  We used a Canivore for our arm, where we stuck with the daisy chain method.",

                    "cooked": "Daisy chain, trunk and branch, and star, are really all electrical the same but with different lengths of trunk and branch. Daisy chain has extremely short branches (basically just traces on the PCBs in each device). Star has extremely long branches. It’s basically impossible to wire a robot with star and stay with the ~12” branch spec for the Rio’s CAN . My team doesn’t us CANivores I’m not going to speak to that standard.\n\nI’d argue that making a reliable CAN network is about the reliability of individual connections more than the total number of failure points. So the trouble with daisy chaining is that the JST PH connectors that are used for a lot of CAN devices are relatively unreliable, and with daisy chaining they can take down the whole network. Daisy chaining also means that every time you need to replace a CAN device you’re messing with the trunk. There are can wires available from a couple suppliers that have an extra loop so unpluging the device won’t break the CAN , but REV’s jam two wires that are already larger than the JST PH is rated for into a single crimp which significantly weakens the grip on the wire and damages the housing so crimps don’t always seat well. Thrift’s CAN cables solder the loop outside the JST to avoid this problem. I’d recommend trunk and branch because it’s with the CAN spec, you can choose whatever connectors you want for the trunk, and you can be really careful with strain relief on the trunk and never have to mess with it again. We use Wago 222-413 and 222-415s VHBed down for our trunk and have found them to be extremely reliable. We make our own JST PH pig tails about 4” long for branches using 24ga mil spec wire, and have had no issues with the connectors since we started making our own using the properly sized wire.",

This is a debated topic on this forum…\n\nNot that Furrules won’t work (they will) but the wires may pull out easier.  The resistance in the connection isn’t really an issue with CAN (or any signal wire in FRC ), but may be with power.\n\nBy a similar token, twisting the wires after you strip them is poor practice. Again the connection will work, but it makes the mechanical holding power of the connector and the contact area smaller.\n\nIMO proper soldering is the most secure option, failing that, minimize the footguns used with your chosen connector (e.g., use zip ties, proper strain relief, hot glue).",
