                    "cooked": "I am finding much grief with a swerveDrivePoseEstimator.  I am hoping there is an obvious flaw that I can’t see.\n\nI have this snippet of code that runs in robotPeriodic:\n\npublic static Pose2d updatePoseWithOdometry() { Rotation2d currentAngle=new Rotation2d(Devices.yawSensor.getYawRadians()); Pose2d prePose=poseEstimator.getEstimatedPosition(); System.out.println(\"Preupdate x: “+prePose.getX()+” yaw “+prePose.getRotation().getDegrees() +” Pigeon angle: \" +currentAngle.getDegrees()); Pose2d currentPose= poseEstimator.update(currentAngle, SwerveModule.getPositions()); System.out.println(\"Pose in odometry x: “+currentPose.getX()+” yaw: \"+currentPose.getRotation().getDegrees()); return currentPose; }\n\nDevices.yawSensor is a wrapper around a Pigeon.  (We have robots with a Pigeon, and with a NavX.  The wrapper allows us to use them interchangeably.)\n\nWe are using PathPlanner.  At the beginniing of autonomous, we call reset on our poseEstimator  (i.e. an instance of SwerveDrivePoseEstimator). That seems to work fine.\n\nThen, on the first update after autonomousInit, we get these lines printed: Preupdate x: 7.2372435897435885 yaw -90.0 Pigeon angle: -90.0 Pose in odometry x: 7.2372435897435885 yaw: -0.008239746093761999\n\nSince the two printn statements are immediately before and immediately after the update statement, any change has to be the result of the update.\n\nPrior to autonomousInit, the estimated position is x=0, y=0 yaw = 0.  The values above (i.e. x=7.2…, yaw = -90, y is not shown) come from the PathPlanner path definition.\n\nThis change to approximately 0 in the estimated rotation (i.e. yaw) of the robot only happens once.  If I disable autonomous, and run it a second time, the correct yaw will be shown after autonomousInit, and it will go in the correct direction.  The consequence is that we go in the wrong direction, once.  The second and subsequent times, it works fine.\n\nIf only the referees would allow us to run our autonomous program on the field once when we turn on the robot, we would be in great shape.\n\nAnd…of course…it didn’t do this at the last competition and “we didn’t change anything that should make a difference”, i.e. we obviously must have changed something, but I’ve examined all the changes and I can’t see anything that should cause problems.  We edited the path, and we have some changes at the end of the program, but the start seems to be the same.\n\nIs there an obvious explanatiion?",

This tries to make the field oriented drive work correctly based on the PathPlanner “promised starting positions” and doesn’t reset the Pigeon heading to 0 to reset field oriented drive, see resetFieldOrientedDir .  Hopefully this will give you some ideas.  Play close attention to the setEstimatedPose function.\n\nDriveSubsystem.java (15.7 KB)",
