Nothing I’ve done has disabled auto exposure, and it seems they might not support ANY UVC-configs. How can these cameras be used in an on-field environment for Apriltag detection without manual exposure control? I have tried the following:\n\nConnecting to them over Photon Vision (being sure to use a USB 3 port), and attempting to turn off auto exposure, and set exposure values. Doing such only gave an exposure range (in the PhotonVision UI webpage) of -1 to -10, suggesting that it couldn’t do anything. When I set it to -1, -10, or any value in between, the output didn’t change, and pointing it at a light still obviously was using auto exposure.\n\nConnecting to them over Photon Vision (being sure to use a USB 3 port), and attempting to turn off auto exposure, and set exposure values.

When I set it to -1, -10, or any value in between, the output didn’t change, and pointing it at a light still obviously was using auto exposure.\n\nConnecting over a Windows computer, again a USB 3 supported cable, and using the built in camera app to set exposure. Doing this only allowed for brightness control, which was entirely brightening/darkening (in post) the image, not disabling auto-exposure. As a confirmation that the application supports exposure control, I plugged in my personal webcam, which allowed for the disabling of auto exposure.\n\nConnecting over a Windows computer, again a USB 3 supported cable, and using the built in camera app to set exposure.

Here, while no output changes occured, I did see that via AVFoundation’s ExposureModes , it said it only supported AVCaptureExposureModeLocked and AVCaptureExposureModeContinuousAutoExposure . I was unable to set these to custom, which would allow me to edit exposure values/disable auto exposure.

Theres no way that Thrifty would forget to support manual exposure, right? Apriltag detection suffers heavily, in our testing with these cameras, when you have auto exposure, as when the scenery changes, it loses tracking of the apriltags for a short time–even with global shutter. Has anyone gotten them to be manual exposure?",

However, when I was testing the camera via Window’s\n\nffmpeg -f dshow -show_video_device_dialog true -i video=\"PC Camera\"\n\nI was also able to edit not only the exposure, but also the saturation… Turning that up gave me this. I still had full 60fps…\n\nMy only remaining question is how I can actually access these properties via a python script, as using Cv2’s implementation doesn’t work, it outputs nothing. Is there a way I could run it on MacOS? I’m trying to do something akin to 6328’s Northstar solution, but I require exposure control through Mac, needing the name of the properties of whatever Windows is using.",
