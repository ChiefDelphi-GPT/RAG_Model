I’m looking for people’s thoughts on the deployment method.\n\nThe intake works on a “spring+gravity-down, winch up” principle for deployment and retraction, with surgical tubing (routing in orange) pulling downwards and a winch (routing in pink) pulling upwards to achieve the blue movement to the position outlined in the green sketch. The winch is driven by a falcon on a 4:1 sport gearbox.\n\nMy theory is that this would provide the resilience benefits of piston-based actuation without requiring a compressor and air tanks.",

But 4:1 seems quite aggressive, even with a small spool, it will probally be difficult to control (non linear and could turn the intake into a pretzel). High powered servos (you may need to play with horn designs) could be a good option too, since they are isolated via the string\n\nOther notes :\n\nwhen deployed it looks like the top links are close to over centering, you will likely want a hard stop to prevent this.\n\nA string outside the bumper is a catching hazard, especially if slack, use caution.",

I modeled it as linear with a weight equal to the intake weight plus the spring weight [1], and travel distance measured from CAD. The resistance force should never get even close to this - the spring acts mostly at the top, and the weight mostly at the bottom. I felt fine modeling it as linear because one decreases while the other increases, peaking at opposite ends; would you stray away from that for control purposes?\n\nWhat do you mean by “turn the intake into a pretzel?”\n\nSkyehawk:\n\nwhen deployed it looks like the top links are close to over centering, you will likely want a hard stop to prevent this.\n\nTheory was the bumper, but I can see the issue. I’ll edit it in.\n\nSkyehawk:\n\nThere are lots of great work arounds to this including velcro atrached to the intake rollers. Run the intake, rips the velcro off.\n\nThis is super clever.\n\nThanks for the feedback, @Skyehawk !\n\nAlex_Y:\n\nWatch out for placing holes in polycarb parts, they create stress risers which can lead to brittle fracture. Making the front plate aluminum can end to being stronger due to avoiding the nasty stress risers on plastic without significantly effecting the compliance from side hits.\n\nYeah, that tracks. We didn’t have issues last year, but if I think back a little we might’ve with the '22 bot in the offseason. An aluminum plate sounds great - would you recommend pocketing/through-lightening it? We have machine time to spare.\n\nAlex_Y:\n\nMany intakes have not just springiness, but also damping which helps dissipate energy from impacts preventing damage resulting from high speeds of an otherwise undamped system.

A bag is another good option if you had a supply of them, you may even get away with a pair of PLG motors.\n\nThe non linearly is something that can be accounted for mechanically (canceling it out) if you really wanted to add the complexity.

I believe you have this set up correctly, but it’s close. The base requirement would be to have the lower 4-bar joint (green line) below the point of first contact (red line), being the outer-most wheel. This looks good now, but any lowering of the lower pivot joint would reduce the possibility of weird bending reversing this state. image 900×855 133 KB\n\nThe spring-retraction only works when the reaction to a force (like ramming a wall) geometrically results in retraction.

It works when your bumpers are perfect, and then lowers when they sag. I would add an additional hard stop. Additionally, if the intake lowers any further than you have it in your screenshot, it will go into an unrecoverable state (in red): image 900×855 105 KB\n\nIt looks like you are using the bumper as a hard stop, this is a mistake we repeatedly make.
