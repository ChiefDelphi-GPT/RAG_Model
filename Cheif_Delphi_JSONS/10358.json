For most parts, we drill all the way through both sides of the tubing and there are oftentimes blow outs or rough edges (burrs) left on the inside of the tubes.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? Any suggestions for reducing these rough edges? We’d like to avoid deburring 100s of holes by hand.\n\nWe are researching: Drill bit materials and points Feeds and speeds\n\nRight now we use standard HSS jobber bits. Very conservative feeds and speeds. Probably 1000 rpm’s and 20 ipm plunge rate.\n\nAside from adjusting speeds and feeds, are there other drill bit types or methods that help with this type of drilling?\n\nIMG_8250 3024×4032 1.91 MB\n\nIMG_8250 3024×4032 1.91 MB\n\nIMG_8250 3024×4032 1.91 MB",

I think a lot of this probably comes down to the fact that in an FRC style shop endmills get abused less than drills…",

Probably 1000 rpm ’s and 20 ipm plunge rate.\n\nOne of the best things you can do is get a copy of the Machinery Handbook - even one a few generations back is a treasure trove of information on machining specific materials.  You’ ll get solid recommendations on speeds (expressed in Surface Feet per Minute typically so you’ ll need to apply the math to your cutter size to get the surface speed at the OD of the tool) as well as feed rates for different materials (and you’ ll find there are differences in “aluminum” such as 6xxx and 7xxx materials).\n\nFeeding slowly can often cause problems because the cutter builds up a lot of heat which is not able to get dissipated.  The reason the chips coming out of the holes are so ever lovin’ hot is because that’s where a lot of the heat is going - too small chips from a lower than optimal feed rate don’t carry the same amount of heat energy and you spend time rubbing the material and mot removing it - softer materials with lower melting point can reach the point where they start to get soft and can make the burrs even worse.  Sometimes it’s best to just get in and get out.\n\nJust about any drilling operation has the possibility (maybe even high probability) to cause burrs to some degree when the cutter breaks through; @Schmools recc of going with a smaller end-cutting end mill to plunge and then clean up the hole to final size will probably result in the cleanest interior holes because the final diameter is reached from a sideways load and not a plunging load which will tend to extrude material into the interior.\n\n@RoboChair suggestion of using shorter drills is pretty much a winner every time as well.  Jobber drills are really quite long - longer than you need in a lot of cases.  They can deflect and end up not moving perpendicularly through the material can end up making oversized and even non-round holes (in extreme cases).  If you’re doing a lot of the same holes, getting shorter, commonly referred to as “screw machine” length, drills is a win due to their added stiffness.  I pretty much use screw machine drills as the main go to when I’m out in my shop and only go with longer drills when needed.\n\nAnd keep your tools sharp so you’re cutting and not wearing the material away - when cutters get dull, they generate a lot of heat and tend to shove their way through the last remaining material at exit rather than cutting but it can be a challenge to get completely burr-free holes on a consistent basis.\n\nFrom your pic I’ ll just say I’ve seen a lot worse so you’re in the general area.",

Split point still will cut all the way to the center, that is why they exist. Whereas chisel tips push the material in the center out to the edges where it can finally be cut. If you are center drilling without breaking through then splits are still better.\n\nNot sure about the validity of split point making more burr, but I know for a fact the required thrust force to cut with them is much lower than a normal bit.",

Our MO is to scribe both sides, punch, measure again, start with a drill-point countersink for a lathe, using a zoom on a camera to make sure that it’s set right in the middle of the punch mark (I have old eyes), then move to a stub 1/4\", then move to a 1 1/8\" annular cutter, flipping the piece end-over-end to do the other side.   Lots of cutting fluid.   Lots of peering to make sure the hole is exactly where you want it.",

Sometimes there are some small burrs inside the tube, but they don’t affect the performance of the rivets.\n\nWe have tried drill mills to plunge into the tube and then mill the hole to size.  It works great for larger holes and pockets. For example, McMaster-Carr .\n\nOnce the hole is large enough for fingers to fit inside, you can try profiling with an undercutting endmill such as, McMaster-Carr to deburr the tube.  Deburring these features is important for the safety of your assembly team.\n\nWe have not used the E-Z Burr, but would love to hear how well it works.",

You can feed a little harder and be fine\n\nFor a high quality HSS drill bit in 6061 I run at 325 SFM.\n\nRegardless though, I don’t think you’re going to get a clean edge on the backside of the hole.\n\nAre you worried about deburring the inside faces of the tubing?
