Our team has an OMIO CNC router and an OMTech 60W laser cutter, as well as a few bandsaws, belt sanders, drill presses, a jigsaw, and a table saw which only mentors can operate. I’d love to hear how you all approach teaching students how to use these tools.\n\nWhat resources, if any, do you give students? Which students do you choose to teach (eg. all new students or only veterans)? How do you keep track of job failures and important information (eg. feeds + speeds for CNC)?\n\nThanks!",

                    "cooked": "What we do is have every team member (mentor and student) go through a formal safety training each year. This is where they learn / get refreshed on the basics of PPE (personal protective equipment) and how each tool operates and give a small example of a use case during the build season.\n\nDuring this time we will ask for a show of hands for who has used this tool before, and if they have any extra tips for safety / operation. We treat our Safety Training Document as a living document and if something is brought up that we didn’t include we will add it for the next training.\n\nSomething we always push (pun intended) is paying attention to the direction you are applying force be it utility knives, bandsaws, drills etc… We see that as a fundamental safety item to be mindful of in case your hand slips while using basic shop tools.\n\nFollowing the safety training we ask if anyone would like to learn how to operate the tools. If we have any takers they will stick around in the shop and get a chance to operate the tool under supervision / guidance while making a measurement, cutting and or drilling a hole.\n\nThat is how we cover the safety of general hand and power tools. By this time, the students have already put their names under the sub-teams they are interested in and we can usually get a good sense of who is interested in learning more about our specialty equipment like our Bridgeport, 3D printers and CNC router.\n\nThose students that are interested will then get paired with a couple mentors that are well versed in those tools and will pass on the knowledge of tooling, speeds and feeds, clamping, using the digital readout etc. I am in the process of recording that information into a formal document but for now it has just been word of mouth being passed down.\n\nWe’ve recently added a CNC milling machine to our tool collection and will be developing a training course that students will go through so they can learn CAM and machine setup. Given the expense involved with this machine and the risk of crashing it this training will be much more formal and those attending must have learned how to operate the manual milling machine first.\n\nOn the topic of job failures we have a pretty good open communication line and observability to the manufacturing sub-team. In training we really push that if something breaks or isn’t working we aren’t going to be mad that you inform us but what will anger us is not knowing about something being broken or needing more material and the deadline is tomorrow.\n\nIf something is continuously breaking we will come back to the design team and shop mentors to review what is happening and how we can improve our process to reduce failures.\n\nFor important information we make 2D shop drawings for everything we manufacture included in those drawing packets are important info or helpful tips.\n\nTLDR\n\nWe take a hands-on approach to training on all the tools, all students and mentors attend the refresher course each year. Every student has the opportunity to learn the tools no matter how many years they’ve been on the team. If they are a veteran student we will often push them to teach the new students and give them the resources needed to do that.\n\nHere is our Safety Training Document\n\nGoogle Drive file.\n\nThis document’s order is such that it matches the layout of tools in the shop so we can make one loop and cover all the tools. Feel free to use / adapt for your team. Feedback is always appreciated.",

                    "cooked": "Last year we started training with a general shop tour explaining the basics of each machine. Our team requires safety tests to be completed before students can run any machines. Last year I preferred to go machine by machine with new team members, running through each machine in a bit more detail so they have the context to understand what these tests are asking. These serve as a good introduction to the machines themselves, too.\n\nOnce all new members have been through this process, we start having rookies work with a veteran or mentor one-on-one to learn how to run each machine. We prioritize teaching the more commonly used machines first. We try to make sure that all of our fabrication rookies feel comfortable running these machines before their first build season. Our CAD team has previously made practice drawings to teach required processes that we use annually. We also have a few drawings to use later on that are more similar to common parts that we see during build season if anyone progresses through their training more quickly. This year we will start to keep a document to keep track of how everyone feels about their abilities for every machine so we know what we need to work on training more and if we need more practice drawings to be made.\n\nIf anyone is interested in learning CNC, we would also try to teach it during this time during pre season. We currently have a very limited number of team members with this knowledge. For training this, we start with the online training course through Haas, whose CNC machines we use. This course is free online, and covers the basics of CNC mills or lathes. After this is done, a mentor or veteran who knows the machine would help teach with another practice part, like a shorter version of a frame rail. It is currently a bit of a struggle trying to find time to teach this since we usually stay busy all the way until kickoff.\n\nAnother part of our training is basically safety protocols, which are covered right away with the safety tests. There is a tests that covers this, but we also talk about proper safety very often and give reminders whenever necessary so everyone learns fast. At the same time, we teach the basics of our shop other than the machines, like how to use a caliper, all about tolerances, and how to read a drawing. Last year and the year before, we taught drawings along with our CAD team so there were clear expectations for both groups about making, reading, and organizing drawings.",

                    "cooked": "Last fall semester, after all the safety training, we used the following Wood Works and Metal Works exercises to train our 50 new students (about 100 total). We had used similar exercises before in previous years. The addition of gauges made on our CNC router made the evaluations less subjective.\n\nAfter passing these two exercises, the students would sign up in groups of 4, for a 3-4 hour session where they assemble, then disassemble an old KOP chassis.\n\nLastly, they would sign up in groups of 4 for a 3-4 hour session where they assemble, then disassemble an old pneumatically operated slap-down intake mechanism our students mounted on a piece of plywood.\n\nThe materials for the Wood Works and Metal Works exercises are inexpensive and easy to get. We got parents to come to our shop to be “shop supervisors” to oversee the training exercises and be the “responsible adult in the room”. We made it clear that no prior knowledge of robotics was needed to serve as a shop supervisor. After a few weeks, some of the parents were actually helping the students by correcting them when they saw they were doing something wrong.\n\nStarting from last season, we required all build team members (Mechanical and Electrical) to acquire some basic level of ability in OnShape. We want them to be able to take measurements for themselves and to be able to see how parts go together so that the Technical Design group members can focus on doing design work.\n\nWe have all the build team members work through these exercises. It has been a revelation to be able to ask a student, during build season, to go make a part out of some type of tube and they come back after a reasonable amount of time with the part made correctly. We did virtually no training after Kickoff.\n\nThe various training exercises greatly increased the level of engagement. Even some of the team members who were on the business side wanted to take the training.\n\nThe basic training exercises also served as a screening mechanism. Many team members join the team and indicate they want to work in the electrical group or they wanted to run the CNC router. On every team, there are always students who stopped attending build meetings after a month or two. Since the amount of resource invested into any particular student for these training exercises is relatively low, not a lot of resources are lost, compared to training someone to run a CNC router only to have them stop showing up. This prevents wasting the time of the person doing the training. It also allows some other student of the opportunity to take the training.\n\nWe also found a few students where they could not pass the first two exercises even after multiple tries. We gently told them that “they are likely to find other areas where it would be easier for them to excel” and directed them into other areas.\n\nFor some roles, we have only been allowing returning team members to train for those roles. Before being accepted for these roles, the officers and mentors have to agree that the student has shown sufficient dedication, good workmanship, demonstrated that they are teachable, and demonstrated that they have a good attitude. These roles are drive team, electrical, manufacturing (CNC router and 3D printer) and advanced mechanism (serve module, climber assembly and maintenance).\n\nWood Works 1 Gauge.pdf (22.7 KB) Wood Works Cutting.pdf (17.0 KB) Wood Works Drilling.pdf (17.4 KB)\n\nMetal Works 4.pdf (91.1 KB)",

It also serves as a record should an accident happen.  It’s a carryover from my time as a teacher and our insurer loves it.  After a lesson is taught on a machine, both the student and the instructor initial the Exposure section to indicate that happened.  Either as part of the process or when the student want to use the machine, a competent mentor questions the student on the safety and operating rules and observes the student using the machine.  They both then initial the Proficiency section.  The version I’ve attached can easily be modified to suit your needs.\n\nWe redo these every year for every student using the shop and keep them in a binder that we carry to competition.  Judges like it.\n\nproficiency passport.docx (194.5 KB)",
