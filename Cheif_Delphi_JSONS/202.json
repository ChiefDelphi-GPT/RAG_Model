We have various cutting tools available, including an OMIO CNC router, an OMTech 60W laser cutter, bandsaws, belt sanders, a drill press, a jigsaw, and a table saw—all of which require mentorship to operate effectively.\n\nI'd appreciate your insights on how you teach students to use these tools. Specifically, what resources do you provide, how do you select students, and how do you track important details like feeds and speeds for CNC operations?\n\nThanks!",

This covers personal protective equipment (PPE), tool operations, and safety procedures, including practical examples during the build season. During training, we conduct show-of-hands to identify past experiences with specific tools and gather safety tips from participants. Our training document is dynamic; if new topics arise, they’re incorporated for future sessions.  \n\nWe emphasize the importance of applying force correctly, whether using utility knives, bandsaws, or drills. This awareness is seen as critical to prevent accidents, especially when handling basic shop tools. After training, interested individuals get hands-on opportunities to operate tools under supervision, experimenting with measurements, cuts, or drilled holes. Students express interest in specialty equipment like Bridgeport machines, 3D printers, and CNC routers by naming their preferred sub-teams. These students are paired with experienced mentors well-versed in advanced tools.  \n\nA CNC milling machine was recently added, prompting the development of a formal training course covering CAM and machine setup. Operating this machine requires prior experience with manual milling machines due to its complexity and potential risks. Open communication with the manufacturing team ensures issues are promptly addressed, reducing equipment failure.  \n\nAll students and mentors participate annually in refresher training, providing ongoing opportunities to master tools regardless of tenure. Veteran students are encouraged to mentor newcomers, sharing resources and knowledge. The Safety Training Document serves as a living resource, updated as needed to reflect evolving practices and challenges.  \n\nBy fostering a hands-on approach, we ensure continuous improvement and adaptation to emerging tools and techniques.",

                    "cooked": "Last year we began training with a general shop tour to explain the fundamentals of each machine. Our team mandates that safety tests be completed before students can operate any machinery. Last year I chose to guide each machine individually with new teammates, offering detailed explanations to ensure they grasped the context needed to understand the significance of these tests, which also served as an excellent introduction to the machines themselves.\n\nFollowing this initial phase, we transitioned to having rookie workers pair up with experienced mentors for hands-on training on specific machines. Prioritizing the teaching of commonly used machines first, we aim to ensure that all fabrication rookies are confident operating these machines before their first build season. Our CAD team had previously created practice drawings to instruct the necessary processes, which we utilize annually. Additionally, we maintain a few drawings tailored to common parts encountered during build season for those progressing faster in their training. This year, we plan to compile a document tracking everyone’s proficiency with each machine to identify areas needing additional training and determine if more practice drawings are required.\n\nFor those interested in learning CNC, we intend to incorporate it into pre-season training. Given the limited number of team members with this expertise, we initiate the training with Haas CNC machines through their online course. This course covers the essentials of CNC milling or lathe operations and is offered free of charge. After completing the online portion, a mentor or experienced individual will assist by guiding them through a practice part, such as a shorter frame rail. Despite efforts to schedule this training, finding suitable time remains challenging due to our busy schedule until kickoff week.\n\nOur training also includes comprehensive safety protocols, which are reinforced through regular safety tests and ongoing reminders to ensure everyone adheres to proper precautions. Concurrently, we teach foundational shop skills, including how to use tools like a caliper, understanding tolerances, and interpreting drawings. Drawing on past experiences, last year and the year before, we collaborated with our CAD team to establish clear expectations regarding drawing creation, reading, and organization.",

                    "cooked": "Last fall semester after completing all the safety training the students participated in the Wood Works and Metal Works exercises designed to enhance their skills. These exercises were conducted in addition to similar activities carried out annually in previous years. The incorporation of precision gauges produced by our CNC router streamlined the evaluation process reducing its reliance on subjective judgment.\n\nFollowing successful completion of these two exercises students formed groups of four to engage in a collaborative activity involving the assembly and disassembly of an old KOP Kit of Parts chassis. Subsequently they signed up for another group project where they assembled and disassembled an old pneumatically operated slap-down intake mechanism installed on a piece of plywood.\n\nThe materials utilized in these exercises were cost-effective and readily available. Parents were encouraged to participate as shop supervisors ensuring they remained neutral regarding the technical aspects of the projects. It was emphasized that no prerequisite knowledge of robotics was necessary for this role. Over time several parents demonstrated their capability to assist students by identifying and correcting errors during their work.\n\nFrom the previous season onward all build team members were required to demonstrate proficiency in OnShape to facilitate effective measurement and assembly processes. This initiative has proven beneficial as students are now capable of independently creating components such as tubes and returning them accurately within a reasonable timeframe.\n\nThese comprehensive training exercises significantly boosted engagement levels among the team members. Even those initially on the business side expressed interest in participating due to enhanced understanding of the technical requirements involved.\n\nThe training also acted as a filter ensuring only those committed to hands-on work continued in the program. Resources were allocated efficiently preventing overtraining individuals who may have struggled with certain tasks early on. This approach allowed other students to develop essential skills without compromising the quality of instruction.\n\nDespite initial difficulties some students required multiple attempts to master the foundational exercises. Upon failing twice they were advised to explore other opportunities where they could contribute more effectively. For roles requiring specialized skills only returning members were permitted to train following thorough vetting by officers and mentors.\n\nThe materials for these exercises included gauge sets and cutting tools priced affordably. Additional resources such as PDF guides on Wood Works and Metal Works operations were distributed to support student learning.",

First, it acts as a permit to use specific equipment, and second, it records incidents if an accident occurs. This concept originated during the author's teaching career, and their insurer appreciates its value. After a machine is taught in a lesson, both the student and instructor sign the Exposure section. Subsequently, either as part of the process or upon the student wanting to use the machine, a competent mentor evaluates their knowledge of safety and operating rules before observing them operate the machine. Both parties then sign the Proficiency section. The attached version can be customized to meet individual needs.  \n\nWe revise this document annually for every student using the shop and compile them into a binder carried to competitions. Judges find this approach beneficial.",
