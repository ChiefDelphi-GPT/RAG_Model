I’m a programmer on a relatively new FRC team, and this offseason, we want to implement Flutter to create a framework that communicates directly with our robot. So, I have a few questions:\n\n1: Was it worth it? 2: What were the challenges? 3: How did you manage the communication between Flutter and the robot?\n\nCurrently, our understanding of Flutter is very basic, as we’re just starting out, so we only know a few things about Dart. I’d like to ask for the opinions of programmers who have already implemented Flutter at FRC . I’ll leave the base code for anyone interested to take a look. Thank you all in advance!\n\nGitHub - muriloMiranda404/flutter-test Contribute to muriloMiranda404/flutter-test development by creating an account on GitHub.\n\nContribute to muriloMiranda404/flutter-test development by creating an account on GitHub.",

The ability to develop “almost native” apps for multiple platforms is very useful when you have a small team.\n\nmurilo404:\n\nWhat were the challenges?\n\nMy team all know Java and Python so developing in Flutter was very easy. We did have a few problems around the project structure, but than can be resolved with better planning.\n\nmurilo404:\n\nHow did you manage the communication between Flutter and the robot?\n\nI believe that use can use nt4 library .

Was definitely worth it for us because its easier for us to change a ui than rebuild a physical button board.\n\n2). I have experience with flutter but our students didn’t, so it was a little more difficult to work on than if it was html based. Also for some reason our auto selector would work in the sim but not on the actual robot and we never got around to debugging it. I would also say that you should definitely get a grasp of the Stream Class due to how network tables are integrated.\n\n3). We were using the nt4 extension and it was pretty easy. It worked well for us. we had a helper class to reference the network table items on our robot code.\n\nto add another option, you can do all of this with the frc web components as well, and they have support for web frameworks. Not to steer away from flutter, as I personally enjoy working with it, but there are def other options if there’s an issue with familiarity. I have not used it at all, so I can’t personally comment on working with it.",

The multiplatform support is incredible, and Dart is an amazing language to learn with. It’s also very easy to make a really aesthetic UI.\n\nState management. It starts off simple, but is really difficult to scale properly. I had to redo it 2 times, and finally got it right (for now). There isn’t a “one size fits all” for it, and trying to understand how to structure the state of your app can be very confusing. Additionally, when it comes to widget sizing and native plugins, there are usually a few minor platform differences, which can be difficult to troubleshoot. MacOS especially has been very troublesome due to its locked down nature.\n\nElastic used network tables to communicate which is standardized, so for this case it was websockets. I’d recommend using Network Tables because of its integration in WPILib.\n\nI’m very glad to see more interest in Flutter throughout FRC , it’s a really nice framework to work with and teaches lots of important concepts in Networking and UI design.",

For your case, you should be able to use the package without any issues.\n\nSince Elastic has to support constantly changing connections between IP addresses, and different subscriptions for different topics updating at different times, it uses a custom implementation with more robust auto-reconnection and shared subscriptions between different widgets. For a custom dashboard where you likely won’t need to support these features, the NT4 Dart package should work just fine.\n\nIf you’re interested though, here’s Elastic’s implementation: elastic-dashboard/lib/services/nt4_client.dart at main · Gold872/elastic-dashboard · GitHub",
