For those who aren’t familiar with Elastic, it’s a Flutter driver dashboard that acts as a drop in replacement for Shuffleboard, with a nicer UI, network optimizations, and more customizability. Elastic was initially released last year, and I was blown away by the community response.\n\n2025 Demo Layout 1920×950 228 KB\n\n2025 Demo Layout 1920×950 228 KB\n\n2025 Demo Layout 1920×950 228 KB\n\nOverall, not much on the outside. The interface and UX is extremely similar, but the differences lie in all the tiny additions and new features.\n\nThere’s lots of new improvements to explore, so let’s begin:\n\nThe most significant change for Elastic in 2025 isn’t even in the actual app, it’s how the app is installed. On the GitHub releases (linked at the bottom of the post), there are now 2 download options for Windows: a portable option (the only option during 2024 season) and now the installer option. Instead of having to manually extract a zip file and create shortcuts, an installer can be ran to install the app and create desktop shortcuts. The portable version will remain available for teams who wish to to continue using it.\n\nThis is only available on Windows as of right now.\n\nThe Alerts widget (which is also being added to WPILib in 2025) is extremely useful for displaying any issues or potential warnings. However, if you want to post a temporary status update or grab the user’s attention when the widget isn’t visible, there isn’t an easy way to do so. Which is why there is now the ability to send notifications from robot code.\n\nAlong with this is the introduction of ElasticLib, which is a 1 file library that can be dropped into a robot project to allow sending notifications. Here’s an example of how to send an error notification with ElasticLib:\n\nWhich will send an on-screen notification that looks like this:\n\nAs of right now, this is only supported in Java, but contributions for a C++ port are open.\n\nElastic has always had the option to customize the color of the app. However, often times the color scheme generated wouldn’t match the vibrancy of the color, especially for bright colors. Now, there are many options as to how to customize the color scheme, which allows for a much wider range of colors across the app.\n\nimage 387×921 7.6 KB (There’s even more!)\n\nimage 387×921 7.6 KB\n\nimage 387×921 7.6 KB\n\nEver had a widget that was customized a specific way that you wanted to be able to copy onto another tab? Well you will no longer have to recreate the widget, you can now copy and paste a widget onto another tab!\n\ncopying_widget 1920×950 230 KB\n\ncopying_widget 1920×950 230 KB\n\ncopying_widget 1920×950 230 KB\n\npasting_widget 1920×950 11.7 KB\n\npasting_widget 1920×950 11.7 KB\n\npasting_widget 1920×950 11.7 KB\n\nCamera streams can use up a LOT of bandwidth. While Elastic has made some measures to conserve bandwidth from the camera streams, if a camera was sending a high resolution stream at a high framerate, there wasn’t much that could be done about it.\n\nNow, there is now the ability to change the quality (compression), resolution, and fps, allowing for low bandwidth camera streams.\n\nimage 576×871 25.6 KB\n\nimage 576×871 25.6 KB\n\nimage 576×871 25.6 KB\n\nIf you want to know more about all the small improvements made, here’s a list of all of them:\n\nSimilar to how the state management for all the draggable containers themselves were redone, the state of each individual widget was also refactored. This allows for much easier testing and fixes issues with widgets not updating after changing settings (most commonly seen with graphs).\n\nRedid NT widget state management · Gold872/elastic-dashboard@61ec1d5 · GitHub\n\nIn a text display often times when a number was really small, it would display in scientific notation, which made it very confusing to read at times. This will no longer happen.\n\nExported JSON files will no longer be a 1 line hard to read mess. Now, they will be indented and should be easier to modify without using a formatter.\n\nIn addition to being able to change colors, you can now display different icons when a boolean value is true or false.\n\nPreviously the camera streams were not very efficient. When dragging a live camera widget, it would open a new http stream which sends the exact same data. Now, duplicate camera streams are shared, and are properly disposed when the widget is not visible.\n\nImproved camera stream efficiency by Gold872 · Pull Request #37 · Gold872/elastic-dashboard · GitHub\n\nIf there’s a camera that sends an extremely high quality stream that’s using too much bandwidth, it’s now possible to lower the quality, resolution, and FPS from the server side.\n\nAdded ability to change camera stream quality by Gold872 · Pull Request #38 · Gold872/elastic-dashboard · GitHub\n\nFor situations where alerts might not be alerting enough, you can now send a notification to the dashboard via robot code. This can be helpful during pre-match setup to alert the drive team of any critical issues that arise.\n\nAllow robot created notifications by EmeraldWither · Pull Request #48 · Gold872/elastic-dashboard · GitHub\n\nEach new release will now include a windows installer, which makes updating significantly easier. Unfortunately due to limitations with InnoSetup, this is only available on windows.\n\nAdd windows installer by Gold872 · Pull Request #54 · Gold872/elastic-dashboard · GitHub\n\nWanted to duplicate a widget onto another tab? Well now that’s easier than ever! Just right click on the widget, click copy, and then paste it where you need to!\n\nCopy & paste feature by DanPeled · Pull Request #62 · Gold872/elastic-dashboard · GitHub\n\nIf for whatever reason you rapidly connect and disconnect from your robot, the auto reconnection will not be broken once the disconnection stops.\n\nImproved connection stability by Gold872 · Pull Request #69 · Gold872/elastic-dashboard · GitHub\n\nIn addition to changing robot size and view options on the Field widget, there’s now the option to change the color of the robot’s bumpers, and the color of trajectories.\n\nadded option to modify robot & trajectory colors by DanPeled · Pull Request #82 · Gold872/elastic-dashboard · GitHub\n\nFor the YAGSL swerve widget, if the angle that’s being displayed is offset by a constant amount, there is now the ability to add an offset so it can be displayed in the desired direction.\n\nSwerve angle offset feature by DanPeled · Pull Request #59 · Gold872/elastic-dashboard · GitHub\n\nThe field image files have been compressed to reduce size and increase performance. The overall size of the app has been reduce by ~25%.\n\nThis also fixed the occasional flicker that’s seen when field objects are updating.\n\nCompress field images with oxipng by Gold856 · Pull Request #103 · Gold872/elastic-dashboard · GitHub\n\nIf you have an idea or feedback, I’d love to hear it! Most of what Elastic has become today is from the support and feedback from over 1,700 users that have downloaded and used the app. Feel free to either comment on this post, or open up an issue on GitHub, I’d love to hear your ideas.\n\nThis year several features (listed on the GitHub release notes) were made by other contributors in FIRST . I’d like to thank the 3 new contributors:\n\n@EmerqldWither\n\n@Dan1\n\n@gold856\n\nJust like last year, Elastic can be downloaded from the releases page on GitHub. For windows users, there is now the option to run an installer instead of extracting a zip file. This method is recommended as it handles app locations and shortcut creation on its own.\n\nNote for Mac Users: Settings from the 2024 version will likely not transfer when installing the 2025 version since the package name has been changed. Before installing, it is recommended to export any layouts or settings you have.\n\nGitHub Repository : GitHub - Gold872/elastic-dashboard: A simple and modern dashboard for FRC\n\nDocumentation : Home · Gold872/elastic-dashboard Wiki · GitHub\n\nDownload : Release Elastic 2025.0.0 Beta 1 · Gold872/elastic-dashboard · GitHub\n\nThank you to everyone that uses Elastic as their driver dashboard. I’m looking forward to seeing how teams make use of it this season!",
