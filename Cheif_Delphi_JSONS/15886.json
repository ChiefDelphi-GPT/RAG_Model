We are preparing our repo for the Rapid React season starting by copying our Infinite Recharge code over. But it doesn’t compile. In particular, NavX and LaserShark gave us errors. AHRS has references to PIDSource but PIDSource was deprecated and was removed from the latest WPILib. LaserShark has references to several WPILib classes that have changed. For example, Sendable and SendableBuilder have moved to different locations, SendableBase was deprecated and removed. I did a “check for vendor library update” and it said everything was up-to-date. We had to make some hacks in order to make it compile. If it is not something we did wrong, I would like to see FIRST coordinates with the 3rd party vendors to get these fixed. BTW, does anybody know what’s the deal with CopperForge’s website that the vendor library page gives you a 404 error? It’s been like that for ages. Somebody had to give me a private link to download their library. They should fix their website link.",

Since you mentioned that page, I re-read it again, slower this time, and did find something I missed. It said PIDSource has been moved to the old command. I checked /vendordeps and found only WPILibNewCommands.json but not OldCommands. So, I installed OldCommands and it seemed to fix the PIDSource issue. However, the Lasershark issue is still there. The problem is Lasershark is referencing Sendable and SendableBuilder in wpilibj. They were moved to util.sendable. Interestingly, I found a LibCu-latest.json in c:\\Users\\Public\\wpilib\\2022\\vendordeps. I compared it with my LibCu.json that I download from a private link. The difference is the URL. In LibCu-latest.json, the URL is https://copperforge.cc/dev/files/vendordeps/LibCu-latest.json but in my LibCu.json, instead of dev/files, it is files/dev. I then entered both URLs in my web browser and found that the URL in LibCu-latest.json gave me a 404 error and the one I downloaded from a private link works. It means the one in c:\\User\\Public\\wpilib\\2022\\vendordeps is WRONG.",

VSCode is being weird. I had hacks to get around all the build issues. When I installed OldCommands thinking it might fix something, I removed all the hacks and VSCode compiled fine. So I thought it did fix it. But after sitting on it for a while and compiled it again, all build errors come back. So VSCode seems to have some sort of cache and if you wait long enough, it will expire! Is there a “clean build” button in VSCode? I had to put all my hacks back and now it compiles fine. In other words, AHRS and Lasershark vendor libraries are still broken. I can get around it with my hacks though.",
