                    "cooked": "It’s been on my mind for a while now, but I haven’t found a reliable method yet.\n\nMany teams use vision-based pose estimation for autonomous pathing and precise Reef Alignment, and my team is working toward the same goal. However, one of the biggest challenges we face is calibrating to each specific competition field .\n\nIn our code, we define 12 poses per alliance , corresponding to each scoring position on the reef. I can calculate the ideal poses mathematically—determining where the robot should align for each stick of the reef. However, we’ve found that these poses need to be tuned for every field due to inevitable variations in reef stick placement, apriltag positioning, and other small inconsistencies. Given the tight tolerances required for reef scoring , we need a robust approach to handle these discrepancies.\n\nTheoretical Pose Calculation\n\nI start by determining the pose of the robot if it were fully lined up to the reef (bumpers touching).\n\nI obtain this pose from Choreo by manually placing the robot against the reef.\n\nFrom there, I apply an offset backward to find the scoring position.However, this approach assumes near-perfect conditions —accurate robot-to-camera offsets, precise apriltag placement, and a field that closely matches the model. Any small variation could throw off alignment.\n\nOn-the-Fly Calibration (Saving “Successful” Poses)\n\nDuring a match, I manually align and score an L4 coral.\n\nI click a button to save the current pose as a reference .\n\nI then attempt to use auto-align with the saved pose for L3 or L2 to verify its reliability.The problem? Quite often, this “confirmation stage” fails —the pose doesn’t work as expected, causing missed corals and confusion.\n\nThese approaches have their flaws, and I’d love to hear feedback on better strategies for tuning auto-align poses on practice day (Thursday). How do other teams approach this problem? What’s the most reliable way to generate poses that actually work in competition?\n\nAnother problem I’ve noticed, both on practice fields and at official events (e.g., Hudson Valley Regional ), is instability in Vision pose estimation when close to the reef apriltags (within <1m ).\n\nThe estimated pose jumps around unpredictably , sometimes shifting the overall position by more than 5cm .\n\nSince the pose estimator’s standard deviation is very low at close range , these sudden changes confuse the auto-align algorithm , causing the robot to move in circles (since its tolerance is 1cm ).\n\nTo mitigate this, I’ve tried rejecting vision updates when the camera is closer than 0.8m to the apriltag , but this often results in misalignment when scoring corals.\n\nHas anyone else encountered this issue? Would additional filtering for Vision help stabilize the estimate? I would love any insight anyone would have!\n\nFYI we use a Limelight 3G and a Limelight 3 for global pose estimation with MT1 and MT2. We use AdvantageKit’s Vision template with further filtering included as well (always trying to avoid “Garbage in, garbage out”).\n\nAs always, feel free to elaborate on technical stuff and yap, I’m trying to learn all I can",

In theory, WpiCal could help also, but we haven’t touched the tool yet.\n\nAlso, PathPlanner struggles with getting to an exact point.  It will get you close, and then finish (no definite number, it’s based on your max accel, we found roughly 6”).  After PathPlanner finishes, we run a fine adjust command (just PID in the X, Y, and rotation), and it gets us spot on the poles.\n\nWe had a 100% success rate at our first event with those tweaks and got the autonomous award with just a 2 piece auto.

We were throwing off our vision 2”+ because it kept finding the processor while our reef moved.\n\nFocusing vision on the tag you are interested in (the pole tag) makes a big difference for aiming, since you don’t care on the field where the absolute location of the reef is anymore, you care where the pole location is relative to the tag.\n\nI actually saw in the OP post and thought it was interesting that they found was the AprilTags were unstable very close (<1m), so they actually turn off the cameras close to the tags.  On our robot, we put on handles that also cover the camera at some times (especially close), so I accidentally might have done this too.  By just trusting wheel odometry the last 18” to the pole with no vision might be more trustworthy than the close tag accuracy.",
