                    "cooked": "Hey everyone, my team is using PathPlanner for autonomous paths and Limelight for pose estimation. We want our autonomous routines to start from wherever the robot is actually positioned at the beginning of the match rather than assuming the first waypoint’s position from PathPlanner. Currently, if there's an accidental misalignment during setup, the auto routine attempts to correct itself to the first PathPlanner waypoint before continuing the path. However, we want it to immediately follow the path from wherever it starts without adjusting to the predefined first waypoint. If the robot’s starting pose does not match the first waypoint in PathPlanner, it currently corrects itself to that waypoint first. We aim to modify this behavior so it ignores the first waypoint’s position and instead starts the path from its current location, driving directly to the end pose. \n\nAdditionally, we have the following questions: Is there a built-in PathPlanner feature to ignore the starting position in the GUI and use the robot’s actual pose instead? Has anyone successfully made auto paths dynamically start from the robot’s actual pose?",

I would recommend not using a pre-made path; instead, I would suggest generating the path dynamically.\n\nWe (4915) have successfully created our own implementation for automatically aligning to reefs.\n```\nThe user provided a text that needs cleanup. They want HTML tags removed and unnecessary elements taken out. The goal is to maintain the original meaning while formatting it properly in English. They also mentioned preserving single paragraphs without line breaks and making minimal changes for coherence.\n\nFirst, I'll remove all HTML tags from the text. The first paragraph has `<p>` tags enclosing the text, which I can eliminate. Also, there's an anchor tag `<a>` within the text; I need to strip that out too. \n\nNext, I notice there's a mention of \"video this looks like what you are trying to do?\" in the first sentence. To make it flow better, I'll rephrase it slightly to ensure clarity without losing the intended meaning. Instead of \"this looks like what you are trying to do,\" I can say \"this seems to be what you're doing.\"\n\nIn the second paragraph, there's a number \"4915.\" Since it's part of the sentence structure, it shouldn't be changed. However, to improve readability, I'll place it after the verb \"have\" where it fits naturally.\n\nAdditionally, the phrase \"pre-made path\" feels a bit informal. Changing it to \"pre-made path\" isn't necessary, but since the user wants to keep it as similar as possible, perhaps just adjusting the comma placement would suffice.\n\nFinally, I'll ensure proper punctuation and grammar throughout the text. This involves adding commas where needed and making sure the sentences read smoothly without any unnecessary words or phrases.\n\nAfter addressing these points, the cleaned-up text should meet the user's requirements: free of HTML, properly formatted, and maintaining the original intent.\n```\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Remove HTML Tags:** Eliminate `<p>` and `<a>` tags to get rid of unnecessary markup.\n2. **Rephrase Sentences for Clarity:** Adjust sentence structures to enhance readability while keeping the original meaning intact.\n3. **Maintain Numerical References:** Keep numbers like \"4915\" in their places as they hold specific information.\n4. **Ensure Proper Punctuation:** Add commas and adjust spacing to create smooth transitions between ideas.\n5. **Combine Paragraphs if Necessary:** Since the user wants a single paragraph, ensure that both parts of the text flow together cohesively.\n\nBy following these steps, the text becomes cleaner, grammatically correct, and easy to understand without altering the original message significantly.\n```",

Currently, our programming team is effectively constructing complex automations using linked waypoints and named commands from the GUI interface. However, we are encountering jumps at the beginning of many middle paths, which we suspect are caused by auto-align commands running parallel to scoring/g movements adjusting the theoretical start point. We have successfully tested chained paths with continuous movement between them, yielding excellent results, leading us to believe there might be a more efficient solution.",
