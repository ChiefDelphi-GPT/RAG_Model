I’m Vivi, and I’m a member of FRC 1073: The Force Team in the New England District.\n\nThroughout this past season, I documented/recorded all four of our on-season competitions (and one off-season) as a personal goal to be able to look back at these moments throughout the following years. These recordings will be composed into five vlogs to highlight our 2025 REEFSCAPE  season and posted online for FIRST -lovers and non- FIRST watchers to enjoy. Not only do these vlogs cover the technical parts of FIRST , but also the joys of being on a FIRST team.\n\nAs of September 9th, 2025, one of five of these vlogs has been edited and published. I hope to release the next four within the next few months, preferably before build season begins…\n\nIf you’re a fellow FIRST -addict like me and want to reminisce on the REEFSCAPE season, feel free to take a watch! Additionally, if you have any tips towards for the YouTube algorithm, that would be gratefully appreciated as well.\n\n1st Vlog (Waterbury, Week 3): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58NwptmQ27M\n\nThank you!",

                    "cooked": "Hi Vivi, this recap video is awesome! I really like how you’ve featured not just the competition, but the personality of your team as a whole. I’m a fan of recaps that include the off-field stuff as well as the on-field. This video was a lot of fun and I hope you’ll make more to document the rest of your team’s season!\n\nSince you asked for suggestions I’ve got a few, though I’m coming at this as a not-actually-media mentor who loves recaps and making recaps. (1) try to start the video with a good hook in the first ~15 seconds, can be something silly that is references later on. For example, the comment about Waterbury not being on the water that comes a little later could maybe be a better to happen closer to the video opening (2) great thumbnails go a long way in boosting views. sometimes my team even makes thumbnails before we make videos. Even with a nice thumbnail, it can be tough to keep an audience for 15min of a recap video, but if you get click throughs to your page, that’s a good thing as well! (3) there’s some places where the background sound between title screens and video seems abrupt. could smooth that with some of the music carrying into the video background potentially.",
