We are adjusting for the target height for loading station april tag in code when we try and get distance for the loading station april tag. The mounting angle in both cases is same.\n\nOur formula for getting a distance is   (height between the camera and target) / tan(angle that the limelight shows + camera mounting angle) ← the angles are in radians. We got this from the limelight documentation.\n\nAny help and ideas on why this might be the case and how can we fix this?\n\nThank you!",
