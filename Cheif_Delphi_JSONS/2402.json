                    "cooked": "Have you ever asked yourself, “How would an MK4 Swerve handle a terrain game? Could it scale obstacles? Or is it doomed to fail at a 2” bump in the ground?”\n\nNo? Well, I am pleased to introduce my latest creation, MK4T Twerve. While the original motivation was literally “it would be funny”, the real purpose is quite serious: improving the performance of traditional swerve in terrain games.\n\nOnshape Link\n\nMk4 Centered Tread 1200×1700 1.1 MB\n\nMk4 Centered Tread 1200×1700 1.1 MB\n\nMk4 Centered Tread 1200×1700 1.1 MB\n\nMk4 Centered Tread 1200×1700 1.1 MB\n\nAs mentioned, the objective of the MK4 Twerve Drive is to be able to handle tough terrain games as efficiently as possible. However, to prevent the design from becoming too complex or inaccessible, I made it a goal to make the design as conservative as possible, hoping to ensure that teams could easily adapt this design into their MK swerve module without needing insanely specialized components or extensive modifications.\n\nEverything above the wheel is the same as the MK4i module, including the shoulder bolts and bearings below the wheel (you just need 2 extra shoulder bolts and 4 more bearings). This means that teams who already have MK4 line modules will have a smoother time integrating Twerve.\n\nSize comparison\n\nWeight: 2.6lbs heavier than the same configuration of regular mk4i (6.0 w/ NEO)\n\nWeight: 2.6lbs heavier than the same configuration of regular mk4i (6.0 w/ NEO)\n\nDesigned to be manufactured using a 3-axis CNC mill with tool changer (7475 has a Tormach 1100m) (and a lathe for the billet wheel)\n\nDesigned to be manufactured using a 3-axis CNC mill with tool changer (7475 has a Tormach 1100m) (and a lathe for the billet wheel)\n\nOnly 8 major custom parts, Two printed pulleys, two-piece billet pulley, two forks, skid plate, belt (+ handful of minor custom printed spacers)\n\nOnly 8 major custom parts, Two printed pulleys, two-piece billet pulley, two forks, skid plate, belt (+ handful of minor custom printed spacers)\n\nKeeps things simple by using the same power transmission system.

I see a few minor issues, but the designs are excellent!\n\nSo, you mentioned additional forces on the bearing, and I wanted to explore that here.\n\nThe standard SDS modules are about 3.635\" from the main bearing to the floor.\n\nBased on your models: 5.006\" for the fixed centered, 5.855\" for the fixed offset, 6.395\"  for the suspension centered, and 7.822\" for the suspension offset.\n\nThat’s anywhere between 38% and 115% increased bearing loading. Granted, the suspension ones very likely decrease the instantaneous forces as the gas shock disperses the force to the bearing over a longer period of time, but any side-loads will still see that increased force.\n\nObviously it’s hard to predict the forces that are seen in FRC , but I would be surprised if these bearings could survive an entire season with 2x the load a standard module has.",
