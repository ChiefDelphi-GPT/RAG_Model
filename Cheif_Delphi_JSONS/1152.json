                    "cooked": "When competing at Belleville, we had an issue where our pose estimates were off by around 6 inches in the left/right (relative to the robot) direction. There may have been some forwards/backwards error as well, but we couldn’t really tell during the competition. We use a Limelight 3G with MegaTag2 for vision and YAGSL for drive + wheel and gyro odometry.\n\nAt home (one of the six segments of the reef), on an open field in Michigan (1502’s full wooden field), and at the practice field at Belleville , we didn’t have this issue. We had what appeared to be precisely accurate odemetry and working autos + pathplanner. This is with different and the same limelight mounts, remeasured each time the mount was changed. The mount was the same after the first match or so.\n\nThe estimation was off in a consistent enough way that we offset the end pose in PathPlanner and found success, but we wasted quite a few autos getting the offset dialed in. When disabled before the start of the match, we could see that the pose was off by a noticeable margin (since we place aligned to the barge tags).\n\nOne thing that I was considering is that our camera might be tilted forward a few degrees in the yaw direction, but I don’t know that for sure, and it may very well be something else.\n\nWe would really like to figure this out and I worry that if we can’t, we will have to waste more matches at our next competition adjusting to “their field”",
