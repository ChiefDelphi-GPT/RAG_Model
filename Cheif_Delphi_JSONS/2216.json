                    "cooked": "Over the course of our season, 2102 has been going through many odometry issues. We eventually made major improvements to both our camera system and implemented 6328’s wheel characterization which both seemed to help but our odometry still was not great at San Diego, our last event. Over the past couple weeks we have been running an investigation into our gyro (a Pigeon 2), as this seemed to be the last point at which inaccuracy could be introduced back into the system. To check this to start, we just spun the robot around in a circle and measured the error accumulated in the gyro system compared to the cameras. This came out to be fairly consistently between 1.5 and 2 degrees regardless of spin speed. We had a theory that this was because the gyro was off-center and we were not compensating for it in code, so we moved it to a temporary location roughly in the center of the robot and did mount calibration, then ran the tests again. This resulted in a similar amount of error. Convinced there might be something in the code, we then wrote a “codebase” that created a single Pigeon 2 object and sent its yaw value to the SmartDashboard in the Periodic, with nothing else at all involved. We than ran the same test but using a marked “home” angle that we would manually rotate the robot away from and back to. This did not change the observed error. To investigate further we took the Pigeon off the robot and swapped in a new one, running tests both on and off the robot. The new gyro presented these exact same issues on the robot, and the old one still presented some inaccuracies while testing. To test it, we had a “testbed” control system set up, with the gyro wired exactly how it was on the real robot, but not attached to anything. We then ran multiple tests where we would start with the Pigeon resting against a wooden board at a fixed angle that was firmly attached to the table, then move and rotate it around and return it to its starting location against the board and measure the error gained. IMG_4013 3024×4032 1.45 MB (testing setup picture) This resulted in a similar amount of error gained per rotation, about 2 degrees, but we also noticed that the rotational value tended to drift much more than we expected and would occasionally slowly increase or decrease by about .1 degree while not moving with no real cause found. At this point we stopped testing, and I am mostly at a loss to what is causing our issues. Is it possible we just have 2 faulty pigeons? I can post further information on how we wired our Pigeon to help determine if the wiring setup is wrong, but barring those 2 possibilities I really have no clue how we are observing this much error.\n\nIMG_4013 3024×4032 1.45 MB\n\nIMG_4013 3024×4032 1.45 MB",
