                    "cooked": "Right now our build space has surprisingly unreliable internet (but is otherwise amazing), so that’s a big reason I don’t want browser based CAD, but…\n\nGoogle docs like simultaneous editing: I’ve never found it helpful to have multiple people editing the same section of a google doc at the same time. I don’t see how it would be that different with CAD, it’s not like Solidworks prevents you from having multiple people work on different parts at once. Sure I can see a few areas where it would be nice to let multiple people update assemblies without check files in and out, but not exactly a game changer.\n\nMKCAD Parts Library: Great, but it is very easy to maintain your own parts library. When you want to use a component that isn’t already in your library, chances are you already have the product page open to download the CAD. So it’s a bit more convenient to let someone else maintain the library, but it’s not hard to maintain your own, and it gives you control over the files to add parts that are common on your team but not from a normal vendor, or modify the CAD of COTS component to make it easier to use.\n\nBrowser based: This is a double edged sword, what if I don’t have an internet connection at a competition or want to work while traveling without jump from Wi-Fi to Wi-Fi? With SolidWorks all this means is I cant check parts in or out, if there was nothing saved locally, I’d have to just live without CAD until I find good Wi-Fi.\n\nFRC specific training materials: Yep most FRC specific CAD training materials are in OnShape, but there are huge amounts of SolidWorks training materials free on the internet. I see lots of reasons for FRC specific design training and CAD training specific to your software. I don’t see that much reason why they need to be combined. When I want to teach CAD, I want to teach good drawing practices, and the specific features that are relevant to our team’s fabrication processes (IE 2.5D plates, milled tube and billet, and 3D printing). When I want to teach mechanism design I want to focus on how to understand and design structures and motion, not how best to CAD each component.\n\nI have no problem with Onshape, but the only major advantage I see is not needing a decent windows computer. Getting every student a Windows PC isn’t hard for our team, so that’s less of a problem than risking CAD outages whenever the Wi-Fi is acting up. It’s also probably easier for a team with very limited CAD/design mentors to just send their students to the spectrum and citrus training materials, then just tell them to google their way to good CAD practices, but this advantage goes away if you’re going to have a mentor teaching basic CAD best practices and overseeing the robot design. So use whatever fits your needs, but these advantages are really pretty minor for teams who don’t have problem getting computers or dedicating a mentor to CAD.",

The only difference is if two people edit the same file at the same time one will get overwritten, which is why good file management systems force you to check out a file to make edits. Like I said, I have no problem with Onshape, it isn’t ideal for our team, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t great for most teams.",

Turns out the COTs parts I’m most likely to need most of the time is basic hardware (screws, nuts and the like) which doesn’t really change that much if at all, or perhaps things like gears, which also are pretty consistent. If I did find that I was missing something it was just a matter of download the model and put it in an appropriate folder and that was pretty much the end of that. It’s nice that MKCAD has it all handled already, but it never felt like that big of a deal to me.",

I could see their progress in real time, and we iterated on the dimensions around 5 times in a few hours completely remotely, with me providing direction on what to try changing and how to approach it, sometimes with me directly editing the sketch as an example. This is the first time our team has had a master sketch. As far as I can tell, this entire process would not have happened without collaborative editing (and the ease to install Onshape), or would have greatly slowed down our build.\n\nTo answer the OP’s question, if you are happy with your current CAD system, stick with it. However, if you feel like it’s a constant battle to teach enough people CAD so that they make useful contributions to the robot design, Onshape may help with that. The teams Solidworks makes sense for are teams where there’s considerable structure around CAD teaching (e.g. students learn it in class or there’s multiple experienced mentors who teach CAD).",

No one is forcing anyone to use Onshape. For most of my teams, access to internet is easier than access to moderately powerful computers. Browser-based has allowed us to easily have every student who wants to try CAD be able to in minutes. This does have a downside, but I hardly find myself somewhere without internet when I need to CAD. The worst time for me was being on a plane traveling for work and not wanting to pay $20 for in-flight wifi.\n\nPatrick3357:\n\nI don’t see how it would be that different with CAD, it’s not like Solidworks prevents you from having multiple people work on different parts at once. Sure I can see a few areas where it would be nice to let multiple people update assemblies without check files in and out, but not exactly a game changer.\n\nIt’s certainly not necessary to what we do in FRC , but having parts and assemblies update in real-time has been a huge boom to teams I work with seeing the development of the CAD and most importantly WHY specific changes were made. Even if not editing, students can log in and follow along with other students or mentors to see exactly what they are doing live, what buttons they are pressing, etc.\n\nPatrick3357:\n\nMKCAD Parts Library: Great, but it is very easy to maintain your own parts library.\n\nA team who has no design mentors familiar with CAD would hardly find this easy. What about rookie students? The barrier to entry is drastically lowered by a centralized library. The crowd-sourced library also makes the small efforts of everyone supporting the library help all other team using it. MKCAD, while not perfect, has nearly every FRC specific component with weights and part numbers. That’s thousands of components that any team can use in mere minutes.\n\nThe usefulness of the FRC specific and other non- FRC specific feature scripts cannot be overstated. These are features that create complex geometries or repetitive patterns in seconds when even experienced users could take minutes to do the same thing. Lighten, tube converter, motor mounting hole pattern, gusset generator, and many more allow teams to focus on the much more interesting problems and avoid inspiration-killing tedious repetitive actions.\n\nOnshape is not the ideal solution for many teams, and that is each team’s choice, but it is the right choice for the vast majority of teams who otherwise lack the resources and knowledge. I believe Onshape has helped level the playing field in designing competitive robots.",

Try to get all of the same size tubes from the same tube converter featurescript, as well as trying to use less derived features. Belt and pulley is also big resource heavy as the tooth count increases. For tips on how to better optimize your Featurescripts, I would check out this video , where you can see that he only uses a single tube converter featurescript, and instead uses features like transform, mirror, and circular pattern. (Channels also really good for FRC Design in general).\n\nFor assemblies, you need to keep your primitive count low.\n\nHeres an example of a pretty well optimized robot for the DDS Cadathon on the 2023 Offseason, 1421 Liftoff . Even though this robot was relatively complex, the primitive count is just under 2.2 million . For reference, one full detail MK4i Module is 1.63 million primitives, and the simplified models we used are simply 95,425 primitives.\n\nimage 1920×977 87.6 KB image 1926×1092 170 KB\n\nimage 1920×977 87.6 KB\n\nimage 1920×977 87.6 KB\n\nimage 1926×1092 170 KB\n\nimage 1926×1092 170 KB\n\nA few things we did to lower our primitive count in our assemblies were using simplified swerve modules, electronics, and motors from @AndrewCard https://parts.frccad.com .\n\nFor more information on primitives and general Onshape load times, heres a reading .

This way you can work on only the section of interest and do not need to load the rest. It also has the advantage of getting more version control granularity\n\nThis is the real performance trick. Once you hit the performance ceiling for a single document, your best bet is to split out into multiple documents, and use derived and in-context geometry for the subassemblies. These also have the advantage of being based on a version, which is less expensive to load for Onshape than a live model, which needs to be regularly synced.\n\nWe hit extreme performance issues about three weeks into the season, and made an emergency pivot to multi-doc. From there it was not a huge problem.\n\nLink2815:\n\nThis year was the first year we used an exchange and it is without a doubt the best the team has ever incoporated CAD into the design process.\n\nWhat is an “exchange” that Onshape set up for you?
