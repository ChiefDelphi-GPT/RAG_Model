                    "cooked": "Hello, Our school just had an audit done by our fire marshal, and the good news is they only had one recommendation for our robotics closet (we have a closet rather than a shop). The bad news is though the one recommendation they have is theoretically an easy fix, I do not know where to start.\n\nTheir recommendation is to have our batteries in a fireproof container. I think the school can find the money (though cheaper is better), but I do not know where to begin looking for one. Some things that may be nice…\n\nIt would be nice if it were on wheels so we could wheel it out or move it if necessary\n\nIt would be nice if it were easy to put other items on top of it (thinking that this could be the bottom of a cart)\n\nWe have been using a Milwaukee Packout cabinet as our event battery box, and that works well for the most part (we need to be careful with the cables) when we close it).\n\nWe also do not know how big it should be. We currently have five batteries that we take to events and four that are still good enough to practice with. We have a host of others that I need to recycle.\n\nI assume that however big the box is, moving forward, we should not keep any batteries outside of it (save for temporarily on the night before and after an event).\n\nI am also assuming we cannot keep the chargers in it.\n\nAnyway, I am wondering if anyone has any recommendations on where to begin looking. ~Mr. R^2",

However, batteries definitely aren’t kept in there.\n\nIt might be worth a gentle poke back at the fire marshal if they have more details on what risks they need mitigated. Lithium batteries definitely pose a big risk, but I can’t say I’ve heard of serious concerns around Lead Acid battery fires while in storage. Multiple sources talk about sealed lead acid battery storage, but I haven’t found anything that specifically calls out a fire risk from a stored battery:\n\nKeeping batteries stored for a long time actually causes them to age. During long idle periods, the battery cells are subjected to self-discharge and decomposition. A sealed lead-acid battery (SLA) is equipped with a design that prohibits...\n\nEst. reading time: 2 minutes\n\nWe get a lot of questions about how to properly store batteries for the \"off season.\" Here, we break down the do's and don'ts you need to follow!\n\nEst. reading time: 3 minutes\n\nBattery storage is important for sealed lead-acid batteries that are stored during the off season. Learn how to properly store your battery for maximum life\n\nEst. reading time: 3 minutes\n\nThe main risks I see are due to improper discharge (IE, short circuit). But, a flammables cabinet wouldn’t actually mitigate this risk. The metal would probably make it worse.\n\nIs there a chance they thought you were using Lithium-based batteries? There are a number of fireproof bags for those on the market . That one might be able to fit an FRC battery with cabling?\n\nAll that being said… If storing your batteries in a flammables cabinet or lipo sack keeps people happy and they’ll buy you one, might as well go for it. Worst case scenario, they reverse course in a few years, and you’ll have a shiny and lightly-used flammables cabinet to put your actual flammables in.",

The biggest issue I know of for lead acid batteries is you want charge them in a well ventilated area. I.e. do not charge them in a flame proof cabinet or even a small closet. Even so you have to keep the Fire Marshal happy. You can get flame proof rated cabinets in various sizes. Google, Uline, Grainger, etc are  places to start your search. The maintenance staff at your school might even have a spare.",

They should not be stored in any kind of airtight container to prevent the risk of Hydrogen buildup (which WOULD present a danger of fire/explosion). Additionally, SLAs tend to prefer cooler environments for long-term storage and an insulated cabinet is the exact opposite of that (it’s a good way to ensure you’ll have to throw all your old batteries away at the start of every season).\n\nIn essence, it’s possible the fire marshal may have unwittingly suggested you make your batteries less safe than they are now. I’d definitely inquire what risks they’re concerned about and whether they mistook the batteries for Lithium. Perhaps present them with Safety Data Sheets ( SDS ) for the batteries as evidence?",
