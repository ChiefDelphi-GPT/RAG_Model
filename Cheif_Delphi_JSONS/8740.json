When i first heard about it I was completely stunned as I didn’t know you could generate trajectory like that and I was wondering if I wanted to get started with trajectories where would I start because i’m not able to find a ton of resources on this topic.",

                    "cooked": "My team didn’t have much experience using trajectories like this due to COVID, but we figured it would be very useful this year especially with certain positions visited so frequently. We already used pre-programmed trajectories using PathWeaver for our autos, so we already had the code to follow trajectories. WPILib actually has great built-in classes to generate trajectories on robots that we discovered this year. This link is a good starting point to see how to generate and follow trajectories. Depending on your drivetrain, you may want to use Path Planner instead if you have swerve. (my team doesn’t have swerve so I don’t really know how trajectories with swerve work, but it’s basically the same)\n\nThen to generate trajectories to go from your current location to another, you also need to have some sort of position localization. Since we had April Tags this year, teams used cameras mounted at specific points on the robot. You can use the Limelight or PhotonVision to do this. My team used Photon Vision with a Raspberry Pi 4 and a USB camera. You just need to calibrate it once and then you’re good to go! Then you need to add a Pose Estimator to combine these vision measurements with odometry to create a prediction for the current position of the robot.\n\nWPILib uses Pose2d to store positions and headings on the field, so the trajectory generator and pose estimator use these data types.\n\nOnce you have where you are, you need to know where you want to go. For this, my time stored the location of every scoring node on the field and used the buttons on our joystick to select which position we wanted. There might be a better way to store these positions, but this was the easiest for us at the time.\n\nThen you can pass these positions (including any other waypoints you want it to stop at on the way) into the trajectory generator to create a path to follow. The last thing to do is to run the trajectory following command, then you’re all done!\n\nI know this is a lot, but this is everything that my team did to get this system working.

Just would like to add the following tool as something I personally found very helpful to log and debug my code: AdvantageScope , by team 6328. I think it is a great tool to log data from every subsystem on your robot, and highly recommend watching the presentation video by Jonah in the link above. Getting trajectory generation and vision working can be quite challenging but having this debugging tool will definitely help you keep track of what data is being collected and see if there are any discrepancies.",

We tested our code the day before competition and thankfully it all worked fine because we simulated it before. But logging and data analysis is really useful to understand how it should and did work.",

That position is fused with odometry using wpilibs SwerveDrivePoseEstimator .\n\nGetting the (field relative) robot velocity can be achieved by deriving your odometry position, or using some of the built chassis speed helpers.\n\nGenerate and follow trajectories\n\nPlug the robots current position and current velocity into WPILIBS trajectory generator . Follow the path however you would in auto (if your not already generating and following trajectories in auto, thats a much better place to start, and some great resources linked above)\n\nThere was a lot of time spent on the initial setup and then improving our localization methods, the trajectory generation worked relatively flawlessly the whole season.\n\nP.S. We ran an incredibly simplified version of our auto drive at both offseason events with a ton of success, it was about 10% the effort and performed equally if not better at times. It used the same pinhole method described above but drove in a straight line to the closest target using PID. The whole button board + on the fly trajectory generation was a crazy 1% optimization rabbit hole that we went down. We tend to go down a lot of these (12 motor swerve another example) never know which ones will pay off. A big challenge of FRC is figuring out where to apply your teams time and resources, and this was definitely one of the lowest ROI optimizations we made.",

I just want to be clear on how it work so basically we can use something like PathFinder that auto generates trajectories for us given a end point,startpoint and velocity. For the start Point you have to figure out your position which I’ve read before as being able to be done with traingulation so it really depends on where we place our co processors (Right now the optimal setup I have planned is one LL3 aand two raspberry pis) and place it in a way that we have two targets at all time and then triangulate the positon. With that we just plug in the startPoint and then if we know the endpoint we just plug that into the trajectory generator.",

This meant that we needed to have a bit of a different routine for following paths in teleop, but it worked very similarly to how it would in auto. We used a holonomic drive controller to get speeds for the bot to follow using the same PID gains as we would in autonomous, except we combined the output of those speeds with that of the driver’s desired speed, which allowed the alignment to control how the robot moved on the Y axis of the field (towards the scoring table) while letting the driver control the robot’s position on the X axis of the field (towards the driver station).\n\nChassisSpeeds alignmentSpeeds = SwerveTrajectory.HDC.calculate(\n\nswerve.getPose(),\n\nnew Pose2d(\n\nswerve.getPose().getX(),\n\nadjustedY,\n\ntargetPose.getRotation()),\n\n0,\n\ntargetPose.getRotation()\n\n);\n\nChassisSpeeds controllerSpeeds = ChassisSpeeds.fromFieldRelativeSpeeds(\n\ndriverX,\n\n0,\n\n0,\n\nswerve.getPose().getRotation()\n\n);\n\nChassisSpeeds comboSpeeds = new ChassisSpeeds(\n\ncontrollerSpeeds.vxMetersPerSecond + alignmentSpeeds.vxMetersPerSecond,\n\ncontrollerSpeeds.vyMetersPerSecond + alignmentSpeeds.vyMetersPerSecond,\n\ncontrollerSpeeds.omegaRadiansPerSecond + alignmentSpeeds.omegaRadiansPerSecond\n\n);\n\nHere’s what it looks like in action, notice that the bot doesn’t move on the field’s X-axis until it is lined up, because the driver didn’t want the bumpers to hit the grid.",

For a holonomic drive, the “search space” is waaaaaaaaaay bigger and a more-flexible/less-analytic approach (e.g. line-segment paths and pure pursuit) is probably a good idea.",

I’ve been thinking about how this could be done because I found 2D aprilTag tracking to be more robust on LL than 3D.
