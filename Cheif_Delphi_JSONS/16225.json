I want to know *your Computer specs. Laptop or desktop? *What are you proud of for your driver’s station aside from your computer? *What are your must haves?\n\nOur must haves are a reliable, portable, touch screenable setup.\n\nThanks for your opinions!\n\nEdit: also what about computers with graphics cards. If we use a couple camera feeds, would a dedicated graphics card be better than an integrated one?",

Windows used to be very bad about that, and it hasn’t gotten much better tbh. Absolute nightmare fuel right there.\n\nYour real priorities should be:\n\nonboard Ethernet, ideally not a fiddly little folding mechanism, but you should be using a short extension to preserve the onboard port anyway\n\nno spinning rust, only solid-state storage as the DS wall tends to take some decent hits, and the laptop is usually running while being moved around.\n\nlots of USB A ports for controllers. Running through a hub can be risky if you need to unplug and replug a malfunctioning controller during a match. The other controllers will be lost as well with a hub (been there done that, also lost comms b/c the hub was handling ethernet).\n\nsd card port may be useful for RoboRio stuffs, but the DS laptop reeeeeeally should only have the DS software.\n\nIn terms of real “specs”, it doesn’t particularly matter unless you’re doing video processing on the DS laptop, but even then. 1114 was still using the 2010 KOP Classmate netbook as of 2019 iirc.\n\nAlso, if your school has some dumb IT restriction about all laptops having a giant password or whatever, never let them find the machine. A password protected DS laptop might as well be a brick to the FTAs, especially if your user account isn’t an admin.",

Get one for the driver, one for the operator, and get minimum one spare each. A controller makes it easy to add commands (just add logic for a button being pressed vs. having to add that logic AND worry about layout on the screen, amongst other things). If one gets damaged/starts working unreliably, MARK IT WITH TAPE. At competitions, make sure its NOWHERE NEAR THE ROBOT when its time to play. The last thing you want is to lose a match because of a bad joystick. A good idea would be to have one laptop as the driver station and another one to deploy code.",

Most important things IMO for the driver station are it’s robust (see business grade laptops) has a good deal of usb type-A ports, an HDMI output can be helpful at times (but not necessary) and a full size ethernet port.",

Laptop or desktop? *What are you proud of for your driver’s station aside from your computer? *What are your must haves?\n\nOur must haves are a reliable, portable, touch screenable setup.\n\nPandamaniacs are running an aging ThinkPad T-series, want to say a T410 but we have a few flavors of ThinkPad floating around the shop.  We transport it and two Xbox controllers in an Apache 3800 case from Harbor Freight; it’s more than plenty sturdy for the job, easy to toss in a car or on the cart, and it was surplus from my former business so the price was right.\n\nI’ve dumped some too-ancient-to-bother-selling laptops in the shop to do things like run our router, but anything that was bought for the team is a used T-series because they are easily serviced and built strong without going full smash-a-hole-in-the-wall with the Panasonic Toughbook.  Full-size built-in Ethernet is crucial for us in particular.\n\nI’ll hit you with a concurring opinion regarding the touchscreen, as touchscreen access is a thing we have to worry about at work.  I still wouldn’t use one in competition personally–CircuitPython boards are dirt dirt cheap for rigging up physical buttons–but if you do decide to pursue that then explore a keyguard.  Here’s one designed for a communication app on an iPad (and an image search for many more examples) :\n\nBy adding physical ridges, you’re going to increase the operator’s accuracy in selection.  Vary the texture on the dividers, and it’ll be easier for an operator to distinguish certain functions without looking.  Any team with a respectable-sized 3D printer or ability to cut flat plastics would be able to pump one out.\n\nTo be clear, I still wouldn’t do a touchscreen for a competition robot–but a keyguard would be how I’d do the wrong thing the right way.",
