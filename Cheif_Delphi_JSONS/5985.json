One of the benefits of ROS seems to be not having one thing crash the entire code.\n\nOne thing that has been concerning me a bit is in the current/traditional set up, if you lose a co-processor, you are likely only losing vision or some small – maybe important – part of your robot, but at worse, you still can drive and play defense.    With the ROS setup, it seems like if you lose the co-processor, the whole robot is down because the orchestrator for the messages connecting all of the nodes is down.\n\nIt also seems like from the diagram you shared at champs, that if the CANiVore hooked to the co-processor failed, it would have the same effect as losing the co-processor itself because that is the one actually controlling the motor controller’s output (the one from the RoboRio is only doing enable/disable functions).\n\nAre these assumptions/understandings correct?     If so, are there things you do to create redundancies/fallback solutions, so if you were to lose a co-processor (or the CANiVore from the co-processor) your robot would have some set of minimal capability?\n\nThanks for your insight.",

                    "cooked": "These are issues that we debated on for most of this past season, as we had many struggles with reliability, specifically with our Nvidia Jetson co-processor. We believe this to be the fault of the connector bridging the module itself to the IO carrier board, as it is not rated anywhere close to the shock a robot can experience throughout a match. We have seemingly solved this issue by switching to an Orange Pi 5, which requires no such connector, and can handle the shock much better (We ran this new setup along with a fully rewired robot at CT Champs and had 0 failures of the control system, minus 2 broken motors causing CAN problems ).\n\nRegarding the CANiVore, we don’t particularly see it as a bigger point of failure, as a RIO only control system would still need a CANiVore to take advantage of the 10Mbit/s CANFD. So losing the RIO CANiVore would also lose control of all motors on its network.\n\nWe do still have plans to implement some kind of failover drivetrain control like we had in 2023, which as you said, would let us at least have the ability to play defense.\n\nI think with the new Pi setup we have reached a place that we are very happy with, but we are still continuing to explore more robust options. And dreaming of a more powerful standard control system from 2026 onwards!",

Our 2 main reasons for this are:\n\nWe are able to directly control CTRE devices over the CAN bus by connecting the co-processor to the network with a canivore.\n\nWe have generally been pretty unimpressed with the motion control solutions offered by the Spark Max.\n\nThat being said, we have talked about attempting to create a way of controlling them over the wire like we did with our ROS1 code base (Sending command packets to the RIO to be applied to the motors). The driving reason for this being the ability to use Neo 550s which may package better than Falcons/Krakens in some mechanisms.",
