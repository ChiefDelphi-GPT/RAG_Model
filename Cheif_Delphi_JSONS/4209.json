That answer allowing 2 fuses to power the radio means that the wiring instead of being protected for 10A is now protected for 20A. This is made worse by allowing PoE outputs, which theoretically could allow 20A to pass through the ethernet cable on those outputs, without ever tripping even a fast blow fuse. That’s already dangerous.\n\nHowever, on the PDP 1.0, this is even more dangerous. R617 allows a PCM to share the fused outputs from the radio. However, this sharing is after the fuse. This means that a radio double powered could feed 30A of current into the allowed PCM wiring. Since one of these could be a breaker, and breakers are slow blow, that could easily allow 40A without tripping any breakers. 40A over 18 AWG wire is a scary situation.\n\nPlease be mindful of this if you choose to wire your radio like this. It creates possible fire hazards.",

I think users need a little more information yet, beyond what is explained in the reply below* Added clarifying circuit questions in further responses below.\n\nThad_House:\n\nHowever, on the PDP 1.0, this is even more dangerous. R617 allows a PCM to share the fused outputs from the radio. However, this sharing is after the fuse. This means that a radio double powered could feed 30A of current into the allowed PCM wiring. Since one of these could be a breaker, and breakers are slow blow, that could easily allow 40A without tripping any breakers. 40A over 18 AWG wire is a scary situation.\n\nThis is an oversite and needs to be addressed by fixing R617 or the like (I think even worse than you mention as I can see using 2 - 20A breakers in parallel).\n\nYou are correct that both a 20A fuse (or ATM breaker now with R619 D) in the radio/ PCM feed weidmuller feed terminals and a 20A breaker/fuse for the radios weidmuller terminals fed via 18awg wire and any of the 16 wago power terminals can both feed a PCM /PH in parallel though the robot radio if redundantly powered because of the presumed common power and ground planes in the new robot radio. @Al_Skierkiewicz @ChuckDickerson\n\n@kiettyyyy are the power and ground planes simply paralleled with the RIO PORT and the 12V weidmuller terminals inside the radio? Is there any kind of polyfusing, diode \"OR\"ing or some other smart combining of the power paths to make them redundant inside the new radios? This will have an immediate affect on any rule changes pending.\n\nThe risk being a short in the PCM /PH 18awg feed wire from the PDP 1.0 could draw 40+A 25A+? which is half the fusing current of an 18awg wire - it will be quite toasty, melt insulation, and short to other things if breakers dont pop or something else in the circuits dont give. which could be a time/temperature problem.\n\nRisks here are dependent on exact AUX1 and AUX2 board feed circuits.\n\nThad_House:\n\nThat answer allowing 2 fuses to power the radio means that the wiring instead of being protected for 10A is now protected for 20A. This is made worse by allowing PoE outputs, which theoretically could allow 20A to pass through the ethernet cable on those outputs, without ever tripping even a fast blow fuse. That’s already dangerous.\n\nIf the outputs of AUX1 and AUX2 are internally polyfused a short in coprocessors or other downstream passive POE devices may not be able to draw 40A from a parallel fed 2x20A breaker robot radio - the internal polyfuses will protect downstream ethernet cabling.\n\nBut if the power and ground planes are just passed through with no polyfusing - then shorts on AUX1 and AUX2 also pose a wire fusing threat to put up to 40A on as low as 24awg twisted pair AUX1/2 output to downstream passive POE device wiring. Or the internal PCB planes/traces of the radio are at risk of fusing depending on board artwork.\n\nThe above risks are also present but less extreme for the PDH / PDP 2.0 with 20A capable via 2 10A parallel circuits and fusing to the non-switchable ports of the PDH or the normal power ports of the PDP2.0.\n\nThis NEEDS a rules update to fix immediately.",

It was determined that as our radios allowed for back feeding of ~75 mA current, causing a 20-25C temperature rise over a period of 20 minutes when in a 22C environment. Over a longer period, we’ve observed a maximum temperature of approximately 65C.\n\nThe change to R703 was not one we wanted to make, but in the interest of safety, we felt we had no other choice based on the figures below as we were close to the limits for ISO 13732-1. There are other devices in the FRC ecosystem that greatly exceed these limits, don’t have warnings and are being discussed on this website.\n\nimage 1118×614 55.7 KB\n\nimage 1118×614 55.7 KB\n\nimage 1118×614 55.7 KB\n\nAs we were designing the radio, we made a conscious decision to not put diodes on the RIO port in the interest of reducing voltage drop. When you’re talking about browning out a critical piece of the control system, like the radio, every millivolt counts.\n\nWe have been continuously testing radios on our own test rigs since September 2023 operating 24 hours a day. This is in addition to the testing FIRST has been doing on their own. In addition to the testing done by Vivid-Hosting and FIRST , the radios have seen extensive use at offseason events. Prior to the 2025 FRC Season, the radio was tested at over 15 offseason events, including (2x) Chezy Champs, and IRI . The radios were also used at the 2024 Championship where 600 teams competed with them.\n\nWe’ve never seen an instance of the radio causing a roboRIO to fail.\n\nWhile there is heat that is produced by our method of applying power to the ethernet port on the roboRIO, in the cases that we observed, it was more prevalent on test bench setups, not real-world robot use cases. The graph below illustrates the power dissipation from the roboRIO ethernet port when connected with a 4 pair ethernet cable to the radio’s RIO port.\n\nimage 966×592 21.8 KB\n\nimage 966×592 21.8 KB\n\nimage 966×592 21.8 KB\n\nOn normal robot use/duty cycle (5 minute match → walk to pit → practice/pit testing → battery change), this will not be an issue.\n\nWe are already working on additional resources to help show teams how to safely connect their RoboRIO through the RIO port.\n\nPhoto credit: Ian Jessett\n\nJwal:\n\n@kiettyyyy are the power and ground planes simply paralleled with the RIO PORT and the 12V weidmuller terminals inside the radio?\n\nNo. There are current limiting resistors and polyfuses in place in this particular case.\n\nJwal:\n\nThis NEEDS a rules update to fix immediately.\n\nIt doesn’t.",

When you’re talking about browning out a critical piece of the control system, like the radio, every millivolt counts.\n\nIf I’m interpreting this right, you’re saying that you couldn’t add reverse current protection due to voltage drop? Is there a reason why you couldn’t use a FET-based reverse current protection circuit? That’s what we use on the MitoCANdria and LaserCAN for this exact reason - protection with a low voltage drop.\n\nIf that too provides too much of a voltage drop, I’d argue that copping that voltage drop and adding a boost converter after the protection circuitry to bring it back up to a stable voltage you can work with is a better approach. For a critical control system component that doesn’t impact motor control, I would expect it to be able to handle periods of brownout.\n\nEven through a polyfuse, I’d expect that the two power inputs would be exclusively switched as opposed to connected “directly” (even if through a fuse and current limit resistors) together. For those playing along at home, there are IC’s that do this for you and they negate the risk of backfeeding, especially if you have two sources at vastly different voltages (such as through a VRM and a PoE pigtail, which I understand isn’t in the official wirings guides but can be a mistake that teams can make) and therefore a larger current flow.",

You mention 75mA in the RIO port use case but what about the attached schematic? Depending on your selection and circuit topology 5+A of backfeed presuming 1A for radio power, and 2x2A for the AUX1/2 ports needs to flow through the current limiting resistor to feed the radio and AUX1/2 if powering from either port individually.\n\nI should measure 1Ω or more to limit 5A@5V (SEVERE brownout/blackout condition…Ω only goes up the higher the system voltage), but I’m not getting close to that when I measure between the POE and 12V ports with a handheld fluke 21III…more like .1Ω?\n\nEdit: Correction to schematics below: PDH /PDP2.0 would do not have an unfused connection between radio and PCM /PH…but they would both in parallel power regulator/aux1/2 devices. But I’m presuming those have polyfuse outputs to protect radio circuits?\n\nimage 918×987 35.5 KB\n\nimage 918×987 35.5 KB\n\nimage 918×987 35.5 KB\n\nAdditionally what is the current or power limit (and protection) for downstream AUX1/2 devices? I dont think this question has ever been answered ( originally posted on 2024 champs radio thread ).",

Then, limelight decided to do something similar (some teams did seem to have trouble using the power terminals).  It’s really kind of a mess at this point, but it’s good people are discussing things, this will very likely lead to: a) getting the rules sorted out as best they can be, under the circumstances; b) putting more knowledge into circulation.\n\nReliable power for critical components is important – and can be tricky.  Personally, I’d rather have really solid connections (we don’t dual power the roboRIO).  I’d also like to see inbuilt super caps in the really critical components with long recovery times, but that doesn’t seem to be in the cards.  I really hope the new “brain” has super solid power connections and, ideally, a super cap.",

All actual POE standards have a controller chip negotiating power with the devices, while passive POE is just shooting some voltage down the Ethernet and hoping for the best, which is apparently how you end up with things like 65C Rios (or even worse for the other ports if the devices aren’t designed to accept it).
