I want to know much of an impact it really had on teams and see how much of a difference it really made.\n\nPersonally, I think Choreo was amazing and I will be encouraging my team to continue using it in future seasons. I think it helped make our paths consistent even without any vision which is a big step up from last year with just PathPlanner.\n\nPlease share your team’s insights regarding Choreo and what your team thought of it or, if you didn’t use it, why your team decided to forgo using it and whether your team will be considering switching to it for next season.",

We also never upgraded to the Sleipnir versions, due to limited time to rebuild the few paths that had trouble generating.\n\nBy the playoffs of the last event, we did have a few auto runs that worked as intended, but at that point we were often hitting opponent robots on the centerline, and that threw off odometry.",

We look forward to future improvements to the solver coming this offseason.\n\nWe found that our autos still required on-field tuning; the carpet available to us this year was different to the competition carpet. Based on our testing prior year carpet held our paths closer to what’s drawn in Choreo than the 2024 carpet. This could be a number of effects; teams not using colsons may have seen different results.\n\nWe also found that far less tuning was required to achieve paths that met our requirements - before our first match Saturday morning we drew up our Amp-side auton that we fielded in Daly Semifinal 1-1. It didn’t hit the midline quite the way we wanted to, but I am confident that had we a second chance out it would have hit notes dead-on.\n\nI and others have found that Choreo’s constant-torque assumption doesn’t hold very well when competing at a high level. We observed that our robot cannot quite meet the acceleration Choreo can come up with due to the drop in battery voltage, but can often make up for falling behind while braking.",

Maybe chopping up the path between stop points before sending to the solver?\n\nThe solve time increases linearly with the number of samples, so splitting up the trajectory won’t speed up the solve unless you generate them in parallel. I just opened an issue for the latter because it sounds feasible: When splitting trajectories at stop points, solve the pieces in parallel for faster solves · Issue #458 · SleipnirGroup/Choreo · GitHub .\n\nWe did manage to speed up feasible solves by a lot recently by increasing the error tolerance ( TrajoptLib , Choreo ).

We found that we were able to get accurate tracking of the paths fairly early in the season, and subsequently new paths often came out correct on the first or second iteration. This was a big departure from my experience with path generation tools in previous years, where tuning took considerably more time and the paths themselves needed to be repeatedly adjusted to get the preferred robot motion.\n\nI attribute a large part of our autonomous success this season (top 3 in auto EPA , being able to write new paths that work the first try in between playoff matches) to Choreo, plan to continue heavy use of it, and look forward to new features and improvements",

We did make some minor changes to the Choreo application as well as ChoreoLib, of which I didn’t find time to PR in-season, however now most of these modifications have already been implemented, have better solutions planned, or are specific to my team’s needs.\n\nGenerally, we found that paths tended to “just work”, with only minor tweaking needed for intaking notes. We originally struggled to get the robot to reliably follow paths, however that was a fault of using poor feedback gains for our swerve modules’ velocity. Still, we found that we had to dial back our robot’s constraints in Choreo to be reliable, but we didn’t feel that this ultimately hindered our performance. The GUI still feels a little clunky and wasn’t entirely intuitive, but hopefully this is resolved as the project matures. Overall, we felt that Choreo greatly reduced the time needed to make new autonomous modes without sacrificing control.\n\nMany thanks to the numerous contributors that made Choreo possible, we are excited to see what improvements are made in the upcoming offseason!",

When the solver approaches a step size of zero and the problem is still infeasible, it switches to a feasibility restoration mode as a last ditch attempt. Those steps are more expensive, and feasibility restoration usually doesn’t get us to a feasible solution; it just makes the solver take longer to give up.\n\nWe’re working on improving the initial guess so the control interval counts are closer to what the optimal trajectory would have. Cubic Spline for initial guess by bruingineer · Pull Request #148 · SleipnirGroup/TrajoptLib · GitHub\n\nDave1998:\n\nDoesn’t that mean it has to “go through more options”?\n\nInterior-point methods don’t do a combinatorial search. To give you a sense of what’s going on, consider trying to find the lowest point on a hilly landscape starting from some initial point. The interior-point method we use approximates the landscape as a bowl (first and second derivative), then takes a step to the bottom of that bowl. Then a new approximation is made and the process is repeated until it converges to a point (I’m hand-waving a lot of safeguards, but that’s the gist). Each decision variable takes a step in parallel, so there’s no combinatorial explosion.\n\nThere’s a video series linked on Sleipnir: Resources about the interior-point method that may help too.",

This was our first year using these path generation tools (historically we did homebrew stuff), so we had a ton of learning experiences. We didn’t use apriltag position recovery in auto, so that was not part of our process.\n\nWe started with the WPILIB Trajectory tooling (no UI), and while it worked, no UI made it hard to manage pathing beyond 3 notes. We switched to PathPlanner, and then after getting that working, switched to Choreo around week 3 of the comp season.\n\nOur paths include long arcs and rotations, and found PathPlanner’s generated routes when turning was involved really inconsistent. Because PP cut the path at the projected time, any turning meant we’d effectively cut the path short. This made things really inconsistent when relying on the path for actual shots and intakes. The amount of position/angle fudging to make shots was ridiculous, and “linked waypoints” were completely useless because we had to adjust them based on how much overshoot we required to compensate, and this carried on to any subsequent paths. For a 5 note auto, our waypoints were basically nonsensical. We tried the path auto-correction, but this basically randomized the results instead of the consistent inconsistency that we could at least deal with.\n\nOnce we switched to choreo, we almost immediately became very consistent with zero additional tuning, and waypoints were much more predictable and representative of the bot’s final position. Any number fudging is small and reasonably explained by other tuning issues and field conditions. We had by far the most successful autos in our team’s history, and choreo was key.",
