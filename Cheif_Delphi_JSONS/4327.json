                    "cooked": "When we were trying to use PathPlanner’s LocalADStar class on the RoboRIO 1, we kept losing communication with the robot, due to the heavy amount of resources required to run LocalADStar . This algorithm requires the RoboRio to create a thread that infinitely loops to find better paths for the robot. Due to this issue, we wanted to try making a program to run this thread on a Raspberry Pi instead of the RoboRio. However, it turns out that this program has already existed for a year.\n\nBy communicating with PathPlanner’s developer , Michael Jansen, we were able to figure out that in 2024, there used to be an official way to offload PathPlanner onto a coprocessor (info about why it was removed at the bottom of this post). This consisted of two parts. The first part was called pplib_coprocessor , a program written in Dart that runs on a coprocessor. The second part was RemoteADStar.java , which ran on the RoboRIO to communicate with the coprocessor through NetworkTables.\n\nI have forked pplib_coprocessor in order to configure GitHub Workflows to automatically build versions of PathPlanner for different OSes and architectures (including linuxarm64 for our OrangePi), and then put the artifacts in a new Release. (The code to upload the files is a little janky at the moment, but it works fairly well for now.)\n\nHere is how you can get PathPlanner offloaded onto your Raspberry Pi in just a few minutes:\n\nGo to our latest release of pplib_coprocessor , and download pplib_coproc_linuxarm64.exe . (All the file extensions are .exe, but each file is still an executable for its respective OS. For example, pplib_coproc_linuxarm64.exe can only be run on ARM64 computers like Raspberry Pis and Orange Pis.)\n\nTransfer the executable you downloaded onto the Raspberry Pi. For example, if your Raspberry Pi has a static IP configured while connected to the radio, you can scp [location of executable] pi@10.TE.AM.N:~/ , where N is the 4th number in the Pi’s IP address. The scp command will use an SSH connection to copy the file to the Raspberry Pi. (If SSH prompts for a password for the user pi , it is most likely raspberry .)\n\nAdd the RemoteADStar.java file to your robot’s code, then in the place where you use PathPlannerLib, use RemoteADStar as the pathfinder by running Pathfinding.setPathfinder(new RemoteADStar());\n\nTest the executable on your Raspberry Pi. SSH into it, and run ./[executable-name] --team 10.TE.AM.2 (Assuming the NetworkTables server is running on the RoboRIO at 10.TE.AM.2 ). If it says that it connected to the NetworkTables server, them everything should run well.\n\nTo make your coprocessor run pplib_coprocessor when it turns on, create a new file named pplib_coprocessor.service : [Unit]\nDescription=PathPlannerLib coprocessor\nAfter=network-online.target\n\n[Service]\nExecStart=/home/pi/pplib_coprocessor.exe --team 10.TE.AM.2\nType=simple\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n\nCopy this file to the correct directory with sudo cp pplib_coprocessor.service /etc/systemd/service , make SystemD recognize it with sudo systemd daemon-reload , and then enable and start the service with sudo systemctl enable pplib_coprocessor and sudo systemctl start pplib_coprocessor . You can make sure there are not any errors by using sudo systemctl status pplib_coprocessor .\n\nThe PathPlanner offloading functionality was removed in 2024, because the only time benefits occur with offloading is when a RoboRIO 1 is used, since the RoboRIO 2 is fast enough to run pathfinding without any significant loss in performance. However, due to high prices and very limited availability of the RoboRIO 2, we have been stuck with RoboRIO 1s for this season, and are trying to make the most of them. We believe many other teams are also stuck with RoboRIO 1s as well, and could benefit from this. If enough teams see offloading to PathPlanner as something that is beneficial, I could try opening a pull request on the PathPlanner GitHub page that officially adds offloading again, and perhaps puts it in the docs as well so people can access information about it more easily.",
