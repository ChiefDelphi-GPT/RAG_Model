The upload itself is as fast as expected.\n\nAt one time I had a discuttion with someone that it because my laptop has connected network drives that are currently not connected and deleting these would resolve the issue, but then I would have to reconnect these when I return to the office.\n\nDoes this makes sense and is there a way to configure VSCode or the WPILib addon to only look at the USB and any other expected locations it should find the Robot?",

The progress indicator just shows 'Idle' all this time.\n\n**Gradle 6.9 didn't have the problem. It was only introduced in 7.0.**\n\nWhen running `./gradlew build --debug`, it looks like the additional time is spent acquiring and releasing locks on network shares that are disconnected (because these are only reachable over VPN, which is disconnected most of the time).\n\n```\n2021-08-05T12:50:13.147+0200 [LIFECYCLE] [org.gradle.internal.buildevents.BuildResultLogger] BUILD SUCCESSFUL in

The progress indicator just shows 'Idle' all this time.\n\n**Gradle 6.9 didn't have the problem. It was only introduced in 7.0.**\n\nWhen running `./gradlew build --debug`, it looks like the additional time is spent acquiring and releasing locks on network shares that are disconnected (because these are only reachable over VPN, which is disconnected most of the time).\n\n```\n2021-08-05T12:50:13.147+0200 [LIFECYCLE] [org.gradle.internal.buildevents.BuildResultLogger] BUILD SUCCESSFUL in

build in every project takes an additional amount of time, often much more than the time actually needed to build the project in the first place.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce \nYou can probably reproduce this issue by:\n1. [mapping a network drive](https://www.dummies.com/computers/pcs/mapping-a-network-drive-on-your-windows-10-pc/) on Windows 10\n2. disconnecting it (for example by disconnecting the VPN it connects through)\n3. running `./gradlew build` on any simple Gradle project, for example a Gradle project generated through https://start.spring.io/.\n4. watching the build succeed, but the process not terminating for some time.\n\n### Your Environment\n\n```\n$ ./gradlew --version\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nGradle 7.1.1\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBuild time:   2021-07-02 12:16:43 UTC\nRevision:     774525a055494e0ece39f522ac7ad17498ce032c\n\nKotlin:       1.4.31\nGroovy:       3.0.7\nAnt:          Apache Ant(TM) version 1.10.9 compiled on September 27 2020\nJVM:          11.0.7 (AdoptOpenJDK 11.0.7+10)\nOS:           Windows 10 10.0 amd64\n```\n\n#### System info\n```\nHost Name:                 DESKTOP-EXAMPLE\nOS Name:                   Microsoft Windows 10 Pro\nOS Version:                10.0.19043 N/A Build 19043\nOS Manufacturer:           Microsoft Corporation\nOS Configuration:          Standalone Workstation\nOS Build Type:             Multiprocessor Free\nRegistered Owner:          *****\nRegistered Organization:\nProduct ID:                *****\nOriginal Install Date:     30-5-2020, 10:42:44\nSystem Boot Time:          5-8-2021, 08:40:59\nSystem Manufacturer:       Gigabyte Technology Co., Ltd.\nSystem Model:              Z170X-UD5 TH\nSystem Type:               x64-based PC\nProcessor(s):              1 Processor(s) Installed.\n                           [01]: Intel64 Family 6 Model 94 Stepping 3 GenuineIntel ~4001 Mhz\nBIOS Version:              American Megatrends Inc.
