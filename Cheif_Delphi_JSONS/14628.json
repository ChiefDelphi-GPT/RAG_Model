                    "cooked": "(Skip the first 3 paragraphs of preamble if you know what Diff swerve is or don’t care for my overthinking)\n\nA farly sensible observation from the 2022 season so far is that coaxial swerve drive has become an effectively surmounted challenge. It is now, for better or worse, very available to a team that desires it whether they want to buy one of many very functional COTS solutions or manufacture their own custom modules. Unlike before 2021, swerve drive is quite common and thus it is more difficult to create a divide in drivetrain performance as coaxial swerve represents a drivetrain technology close to the limits of what is reasonable attainable within the current ruleset and technologies of FRC. In order to outperform an opponent from a robot design standpoint one can either drive faster, have more pushing power, be more agile or have superior control systems. Agility is effectively solved with the true omnidirectional movement of swerve. Fancy control systems is not something our team thinks attainable to the level required to give a good performance divide, so speed and power is our new name of the game.\n\nUtilising more than eight motor slots is not very practical for a competitive robot design. Alongside this limitation, the NEO or Falcon represents the most power output in one slot permissable by the rules (aside from complex pneumatic engines that are heavy and cumbersome). Traditional coaxial swerve uses four slots for drive, four for steering. Thus only half the available power is put to carpet.  So, if all eight motor slots could be fully utilised there could be a performance gain to be had that current COTS and custom swerve solutions couldn’t practically meet. Of course, then a solution is needed to regulate when some of this motor power is diverted from wheel turning to module turning. Ideally this would be done with a mechanical solution to remove extra electronic complexity or the need for more than already present actuators. This problem has been solved a few times in the past, and is known as Differential Swerve.\n\nBy utilising a differential, the control of the module wheel rotation and module rotation are controlled by relative similar and relative different motor rpms respectively. Rather than controlling the independant speed of two motors, we control the relative speed of two motors. In an example mechanism using arbitrary values, motor A turns at 0.5 speed and motor B turns at -0.5 speed, the wheel recieves 0.5 speed (and power). Here when the speeds are summed there is a zero result, so not module rotation. If motor A turns at 0.5 speed and B turns at -0.4 speed, the wheel recieves 0.4 speed. When these values are summed, a value of 0.1 is present meaning the module will rotate with 0.1 speed.  If motor A turns at 0.2 speed and motor B at 0.2 speed, the module will rotate at 0.4 speed. In practice module rotation speed is a different angular velocity to the wheel, these values purely exist to demonstrate a point and are not to be taken with any mathematical precision.\n\nSimilar to our other swerve thread, this one aims to document our development of custom differential swerve modules known as SS8.1. This aims to be a documentation process for us, feedback and help to and from the community, and a blueprint for any other teams that aim to persue a similar goal. A thread like this from @nuclearnerd is what got our team started with swerve, so I take it fairly seriously as without these threads we wouldn’t be here.\n\nSS8.1 Render A 2880×1800 319 KB\n\nSS8.1 Render A 2880×1800 319 KB\n\nSS8.1 Render A 2880×1800 319 KB\n\nPrimary Objectives:\n\nDesign, construct and implement custom differential swerve modules that are reliable enough to take to support a competative robot\n\nCompete at an official event with custom differential swerve modules, preferably in 2023\n\nDirectly compare the performance of Coaxial and Differential swerve modules of similar build and technologies in order to gain a comparison of performance difference due to design concept. By designing the modules to fit directly onto our 2022 robot they can be quickly tested in real world loading conditions, as well as against the existing coaxial modules.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\nUtilise as few ‘difficult’ components as possible. This is defined as a part that requires high tolerance CNC manufacturing and not available off the shelf ie. that would be inaccesable to most teams. Differential mechanisms that can survive in FRC conditions almost certaintly require at least one complex metal part, either bevel gears or ring gears. Not defined as a difficult part is one printed with FDM printers out of common filament such as ABS, nor is an aluminium plate machined on a 2.5 axis CNC router as these could be reasonably expected available to a team attemting this type of project.\n\nReduce cost wherever possible. This may be achieved by substituting materials, or by abiding by SO1.\n\nUtilise as many similar design features to our current custom coaxial swerve modules. This reduces the unknowns as features such as a type of printed fork or machined plate that could bring out surprises in manufacturing and implementing.\n\nApply generative design where possible. This is permits some weight saving as well as requiring proper engineering analysis of loads to do correctly, encouraging some maths to be performed. Also it looks super cool.\n\nBreaking the formality, we see this as a genuine path to getting an edge on the competition in the age of COTS swerve. Our robot this year was light at 40kg, and was definately one of if not the fastest and most nimble on the field. Where it lacked though was enough power to push out of defense, in part due to low traction wheels but also going up against six-falcon tank drives. Swerve drives are also pretty inefficient, I wouldn’t be surprised if 10% of motor power is lost in the drivetrain particularly one like ours that uses some 3D printed components.\n\nDifferential swerve drive is not new, 971 had an early concept in 2017 with the wheel in between the differential gears and i’m guessing that others had done it earlier. A few Diff Swerve concepts exist on CD too, but only two I can see really going beyond the basic prototyping stage. What I have not seen evidence of is one making it to the field, nor a proper comparison to answer whether or not its worthwhile.\n\nBelow are some CAD photos of the current running concept. It utilises a pair of NEO motors, one CTRE absolute encoder, some bevel gears and spur gears from WCP (i think?) and some bearings from Thrifty Bot. Wheel is 100mm diameter (4\" for those backwards) and designed to fit 25.4mm wide tread (1in).\n\nScreen Shot 2022-03-24 at 12.39.28 am 1956×1622 813 KB\n\nScreen Shot 2022-03-24 at 12.39.28 am 1956×1622 813 KB\n\nScreen Shot 2022-03-24 at 12.41.15 am 1566×1708 410 KB\n\nScreen Shot 2022-03-24 at 12.41.15 am 1566×1708 410 KB\n\nScreen Shot 2022-03-24 at 12.42.05 am 1694×1864 791 KB\n\nScreen Shot 2022-03-24 at 12.42.05 am 1694×1864 791 KB\n\nSS8.1 Render B 2880×1800 1.49 MB Screen Shot 2022-03-23 at 11.38.19 pm 2480×1554 626 KB\n\nSS8.1 Render B 2880×1800 1.49 MB\n\nSS8.1 Render B 2880×1800 1.49 MB\n\nScreen Shot 2022-03-23 at 11.38.19 pm 2480×1554 626 KB\n\nScreen Shot 2022-03-23 at 11.38.19 pm 2480×1554 626 KB\n\nThe module below the plate is very similar to our last swerve (SS7.2). A great decision that could make or break this module is the type of differential to got with. We didn’t want a wheel-in-diff swerve as this can’t practically get over any obsticle (see 971’s variant). We saw two types of diffs as viable; bevel gear or spur gear. Bevel gear diff has the advantage or orienting the output with the wheel, so only a chain/belt/spur gear drive down is required. It is also generally more compact. Spur gear diffs need more space, parts and a later bevel gear stage to drive the wheel but have significant advantage of not needing custom machined bevel gears, a major plus for us. Instead, as modelled, it only requires two spur ring gears with a pulley profile. If machined in two parts, these can be done on a good 2.5 axis router out of aluminium with patience. We will probably get them machined out of steel with a CNC milling machine, but we honestly believe it is a viable route. The cutaway above shows the mechanism, with the four spur gears bridging the height difference of the two ring gears. Initially both rings were coupled by a single long spur gear, but I quickly realised that this wouldn’t work. Only one spur gear transmits power to the wheel, the other one on the axle is to balance the torque applied to the rotating parts of the module.\n\nAnother complex part is the two idler spur gears nestled inside the black bracket. These are riding on dead shafts and will be cut from Andymark 20dp spur gear stock as a basic lathe can bore the bearing seats. Much easier than using hex gears, also alot cheaper! The used bevel and hex spur gears are the same as our last swerve, so just building off that.\n\nKnown problems to be adressed or tested for:\n\nGeneratively designed parts will be 3D printed and rigorously tested for durability. Encoder mount may need to be beefed up, though the simulation says it can take a load of 300N where the encoder is. Off-axis load is the killer though.\n\nPrinted forks + other complex drivetrain parts worked perfectly in the 2022 season without a single replacement, but with the increase in power they may begin to fail.\n\nThe module rotation is geared very fast, as in for ~1000rpm max speed. With only one motor turning this is lowered to 500rpm though, so remains to be seen how it actually performs. Absolute encoder tracks module angle.\n\nDrive is geared 5.1:1 (14t → 70T, 70T → 24t, 15t → 45t). This is a bit faster than the 6:1 on SS7.2 as we think we’ve got the power for it and the drive motors will be unlikely to be always running 100% for drive as some power needs to be given to rotation.\n\nThese modules are looking to be quite heavy. 800g is given to the ring gears alone, per module. The top plate will be made of HDPE to help alleviate this, as well as decent pocketing, but we’ll just have to see. I haven’t done a full BOM and weight breakdown yet because i’m kind of scared to find out how much it actually weighs.\n\nThe open top differential will turn fingers into mincemeat. As the rings are toothed, the ring below spins the other way, the differnetial gears are all sticking out, the differential gear stack rotates within the ring gears at up to 1000rpm. Yeah, will need to cover that up.\n\nActually getting the rings made will be a huge pain. Here in australia there are zero small CNC manufacturers, and material stock is incredibly difficult or expensive to obtain in anything other than mild steel or hardware store aluminium. If you live in the US you may not quite understand how obscenely hard/expensive it is to get anything robot worthy other than those two basic metals in Aus (plus some plastics).\n\nQuestions for general response:\n\nAny obvious problems? Please let me know\n\nCould using 6061 aluminium for the ring gears be feasable? The 24t Spur gears running on it are also aluminium, so it shouldn’t wear too much but we can’t anodise them. Load simulation tells me the metal is strong enough, it just depends on wear.\n\nNext on the agenda is a MDF and 3D printed mockup of the module, as with SS7.2. This will allow us to confirm the differential’s functionality. Any questions, feedback, or other comments are very much appreciated!\n\nCAD Link: https://grabcad.com/library/ss8-1-differential-swerve-module-1\n\nI’ll leave on a comparison shot between SS8.1 and SS7.2 Screen Shot 2022-03-24 at 1.05.42 am 2134×1290 245 KB Screen Shot 2022-03-24 at 1.06.38 am 1892×964 238 KB\n\nScreen Shot 2022-03-24 at 1.05.42 am 2134×1290 245 KB\n\nScreen Shot 2022-03-24 at 1.05.42 am 2134×1290 245 KB\n\nScreen Shot 2022-03-24 at 1.06.38 am 1892×964 238 KB\n\nScreen Shot 2022-03-24 at 1.06.38 am 1892×964 238 KB",

Use the published equations.  Mis-matched materials may end up helping.  Look at hard anodizing your teeth.   That’s not nearly as deep as case hardening, but it’s -something- to increase durability!\n\nI remember running numbers on Dr. Joe’s diff swerve…  you should look at what motor speeds you need across the full 4 quadrant map of forward/reverse vs clockwise/CCW.\n\nI wish I was closer!",

In australia such high end printers are pretty rare, but im sure it’s possible to get done.\n\nConversely we found that with colson wheels on our swerve we were motor power limited from one NEO per module (6:1, 4x1.5\" colson). Using tread has other motives such as cost and proving that we can, but remains to be seen if we will now be traction limited. Hopefully our future comparison will highlight that.\n\ns-neff:\n\ndoes not actually transmit drive power through that nylon profile\n\nGood to know, our tooth profile is standard 20DP so its a bit stronger than thrifty swerves. Personally I lean toward steel gears as we had the weight this year (15kg under) and it’ll ensure no critical failures, but re-printing some parts will be much favoured over re-machining eight large steel ring gears in two parts each.",

It think nylon won’t fail immediately, as long as it’s lubricated. You’ll definitely have enough time to start programming it, which is the really hard part.\n\nTaking a second look at the design, 2D Wire EDM is the technology that stands out to me as most suitable - trying to mill steel with a tiny bit to gear tolerances will suck. The flex of your tool will take you out of tolerance before you even get to the machine frame.\n\nThe other “right tool” is an actual gear hobbing machine. I worked with Associated Gear in Los Angeles who had one, but they’re a pro job shop. Might be worth searching “gear hobbing” near you.",

Not to take robot weight, but to ensure the design works and start code as you say.\n\nWill take a look for a gear cutter nearby, though again the pulley profile means that CNC machining in two parts requires the least setups.\n\nMazeOfEncryption:\n\nI bet you could get the form factor of each module even smaller too\n\nTempting, ill take a look.",

If you can make a differential swerve work reliably, you were already capable of this advantage you were dismissing as too difficult - and if great control systems are out of reach for your team, so is differential swerve.\n\nI hate to single out a tiny part of a huge post that shows a lot of detailed mechanical design work - but it seems like this is one detail that hasn’t really been fully analyzed. You can prove out your basic feasibility of something like this on even a smaller, less mechanically complex scale if you want - but I think you’ll be spending a lot of time chasing a level of precision in your control loops that is rarely seen in FRC .",
