I know how they both work and what they provide us, but my question is how can they help us get  more precise autonomous movements? For example: Is there a way in Labview to tell a motor to run until it reaches a certain angle and then stop? Is there a way to use the encoders to tell a motor to turn so many times and then stop? How can I use those sensors to plan out a path during auto? Last year, we used flat sequences for auto and it worked well, but this year we are trying to do better and possibly pick up another cone. I am a researcher, so links to articles, tutorials, videos, etc are much appreciated. I have searched but haven’t found anything helpful.",

(Generally we have found that setting “on target” works best if the error is within the deadband for X consecutive calls where X is the input parameter “on target count”.\n\nCreate a generic position control VI.

This routine can directly be called in teleop inside a case structure triggered by pressing and holding a button.
