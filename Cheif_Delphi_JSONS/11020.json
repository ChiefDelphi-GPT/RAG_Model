We apply a two different multipliers for throttle and turning, and have a slew rate for throttle to control acceleration. We’ve running this for a while and found that our turning felt very unintuivative. Also, we’ve been tipping whenever we get hit by other robots. I was wondering a few things\n\nHow I can implement cheesy or curvature drive without tipping while turning at high speeds.\n\nOr modify our turn scaling for arcade to turn to feel more consistent while prohibiting fast turns at high speeds.\n\nI will take any suggestions. This is our current code. I think the multiplier may have something to do with unconsistent turning, but I’m not sure.\n\nEdit: There are no mechanical changes we can make to the arm/end effector to significantly relocate weight. Testing controller inputs vs real life results and applying variable limits / curves is our only tool.",

I was part of the inspection team at the Space City and FiT District Championship events. We were given the edict “only metal fasteners” by the Chief LRIs so any ballast attached with zip ties or Velcro is an instant fail. We worked with one team to attach their ballast using steel zip ties and they failed in the next match. Another had their ballast bolted onto a piece of steel with 3/8\" or 1/2\" bolts but after a number of matches, the bolts turned the holes in the steel mounting plate into large ovals and the ballast popped out.\n\nBest of luck at Houston Championship!",

In turn, this causes a torque that rotates the whole robot, eventually to the point where the system is unstable and the robot falls.\n\nYour only two options are moving the center of mass, or reducing forces.\n\nSoftware can help, as long as it does one of those two things. However, there is no silver bullet for getting around the laws of physics.\n\nYou always need to limit translational acceleration to reduce the tip-inducing forces. Rotation while still can be ok, but rotation while translating will also be tip inducing.\n\nYou can try to get more clever about how to limit acceleration, but there will always be diminishing returns at a point.",

You can’t fix everything in code, mechanical needs to perhaps accept a lot of responsibility here.\n\ngerthworm:\n\nYou always need to limit translational acceleration to reduce the tip-inducing forces.
