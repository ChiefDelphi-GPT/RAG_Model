With build season fast approaching, I’m looking for a way to promote continual commits of code assuming GitHub is still blocked. While “just using a wifi hotspot” might still be the optimal solution, I’m interested in hearing a variety of other solutions as well.",

Another route they may consider - often firewalls can be configured to allowlist specific computers (e.g. via MAC address). Perhaps they’ll agree to allowlist a set of team computers.\n\nDirect alternatives (may or may not have luck if the school finds GitHub to be unacceptable): GitLab or BitBucket\n\nLess direct, but perhaps more workable with the school: You could host your own Git server, via Azure, AWS, GCP, etc. Either on a free tier or using an educational tier (we’ve gotten free Azure credits for some team apps we hosted in the past).\n\nLuckily we don’t have quite that bad of a problem, but do have some similar struggles. Our district blocks SSH, and GitHub is really pushing towards that right now.",

If you are able to get one installed, do not let your school district know about it because they will try and block it\n\nMy district has offered several times to unlock github for certain students and mentors, but haven’t actually done it yet.\n\nI ended up installing PIA VPN which works well for me. Unfortunately now, I will have to find a different solution on newer computers since I cannot install VPNs anymore.\n\nThe route we will have to take for this is to have a computer that is off the school’s network (Login/windows). That way you will have admin access and can install a VPN.\n\nIn short: VPN",

Another route they may consider - often firewalls can be configured to allowlist specific computers (e.g. via MAC address). Perhaps they’ll agree to allowlist a set of team computers.\n\nAnother possibility, depending on their blocking solution would be to unblock specific URL patterns for your team’s repo, etc.\n\nmdurrani834:\n\nIt is because GitHub clearly has all the hacker mySQL injection attack blockchain Log4j exploit virus free windows activation key attack vectors.

At our team’s school they blog the SSH protocol (TCP port 22) so we cannot use github repos cloned with ssh:// links, thankfully clones using https:// links continue to work.\n\nDo your classrooms have ethernet ports? For whatever reasons our school district doesn’t filter connections that originate from the hardwired LAN, only WiFi connections. So the easiest way for us to get around any blocked domains or ports is to just plug into an ethernet port.\n\nWe’ve had various maven repository domains for 3rd party vendors blocked. This will cause some new builds to fail in VS Code. We always report them to the staff to unblock.\n\nIf asking nicely doesn’t work, you can set up proxy to tunnel github.com requests out past the firewall. Everyone who uses github on campus would need to set up a proxy. And you’ll need some outside proxy service, or set one up yourself. Github Proxy Tutorial",

If you have a website with CPanel, I believe CPanel now has a git repository feature. It’s not very good, but it works.\n\nThe real problem with not using GitHub is that pretty much every team uses Github. If you want to reference someone’s code, it’s most likely on GitHub.
