As a community-driven solution, any form of support helps us.</p>  \n<hr>  \n<h3><a name=\"p-3602536-our-mission-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-3602536-our-mission-2\"></a>Our Mission</h3>  \n<p>During the <span class=\"abbreviation\">FIRST<template class=\"tooltiptext\" data-text=\"For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology\"></template></span> Championship, some teams expressed their concern over the availability of Meta Quests in regions where it is not officially sold. QuestNav was created with the purpose to expand the availability of cheap, high-quality localization to <em>all teams.</em> Not just those in countries where Quests are sold. <strong>As such, we are announcing today that we have decided to <em>explore</em> expanding support to the Pico 4</strong>, which is officially sold in China, and is available in many other nations as well.</p>  \n<h3><a name=\"p-3602536-documentation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-3602536-documentation-3\"></a>Documentation</h3>  \n<p>Today, we are also announcing the release of comprehensive documentation for version <code>v0.9</code> of QuestNav. This should help clear up a lot of frequently asked questions. The site is available at <a href=\"https://questnav.gg\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://questnav.gg</a> now! A lot will be changing between now and 2026, as such, documentation on this rolling release cycle may be delayed. We encourage teams to try QuestNav but be prepared for changes as we implement them.</p>  \n<h3><a name=\"p-3602536-support-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-3602536-support-4\"></a>Support</h3>  \n<p>In order to better assist teams, we are recommending people join our discord instead of using <span class=\"abbreviation\">CD<template class=\"tooltiptext\" data-text=\"Chief Delphi\"></template></span> for support due to its real-time nature. Join <a href=\"https://discord.gg/hD3FtR7YAZ\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here.</a></p>  \n<hr>  \n<h3><a name=\"p-3602536-what-is-changing-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-3602536-what-is-changing-5\"></a>What is Changing?</h3>  \n<h4><a name=\"p-3602536-apriltag-support-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-3602536-aprilateral-support-6\"></a>AprilTag Support</h4>  \n<p>After the 2025 season, many teams expressed interest in using the AprilTags on the field for initialization of QuestNav’s pose and validation of the <span class=\"abbreviation\">VSLAM<template class=\"tooltiptext\" data-text=\"Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping\"></template></span> pose during the match. With the recent release of Meta’s Passthrough Camera API, we can utilize this along with the Spatial Anchoring API to provide a consistent and performant fiducial detector. <strong>This completely eliminates the need for any external devices that many teams previously used like LimeLights or PhotonVision.</strong> We expect this to remove the issues of human error in resetting the start pose, as well as accounting for edge cases that may—albeit <strong>very</strong> rarely—arise during the match.</p>  \n<h4><a name=\"p-3602536-networktables-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-3602536-networktables-7\"></a>NetworkTables</h4>  \n<p>Along with this, we plan to improve the connection robustness of the headset by implementing a more up-to-date NetworkTables library, and supporting alternative connection methods.</p>  \n<h4><a name=\"p-3602536-debugging-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-3602536-debugging-8\"></a>Debugging</h4>  \n<p>In the coming months we will be releasing a web-based log viewer for teams to easily debug any issues that may occur during use. This will also make it significantly easier to provide community support and hopefully allow us to assist more teams.</p>  \n<h4><a name=\"p-3602536-more-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-3602536-more-9\"></a>More</h4>  \n<p>We expect some other miscellaneous changes to be made as well, but we wanted to outline the major ones. Be sure to keep an eye on the <a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/QuestNav/projects/3\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">project roadmap</a> and be sure to open an issue on GitHub if you have a feature suggestion!</p>  \n<hr>  \n<h3><a name=\"p-3602536-wrap-up-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-3602536-wrap-up-10\"></a>Wrap-up</h3>  \n<p>We will be providing updates in this thread as new features are implemented and released to keep everyone informed. We hope to see a lot of Quests next year!</p>  \n<p>Best,<br> Sean<br> 5152 Lead Programmer &amp; QuestNav PM<br> <span class=\"abbreviation\">FRC<template class=\"tooltiptext\" data-text=\"FIRST Robotics Competition\"></template></span> Team 5152 - Alotobots</p>  \n<p><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/juchong\">@juchong</a></p>",

Now, we advise using the built-in API on the Quest itself for this operation, which differs from our previous approach of applying an offset on the robot code side. This change is highly recommended as we move toward achieving AprilTag compatibility, allowing the Quest to maintain its independent state.\n\nFor detailed instructions, please refer to our updated documentation: [https://questnav.gg/docs/getting-started/robot-code#setting-robot-pose](https://questnav.gg/docs/getting-started/robot-code#setting-robot-pose).\n\nThis adjustment ensures better independence and compatibility, enhancing overall functionality.

This took a little work to figure out, but it can be done by calling a different constructor in TunerConstants. \n\nCTRE does use a different timestamp, and this is kind of a problem, but starting in Tuner X 2025.3.1.0 the generated CommandSwerveDrivetrain has an AddVisionMeasurement override that already handles this.

I wrote all of the documentation and our team switched away from using CTRE swerve template this year, so I was still working with last year’s knowledge. I should be able to get it fixed pretty soon. As for the odometry fusing, I will have to look into that. Feel free to make a GitHub issue if the way you solved it is working and I’ll write up the documentation. Join here.",
