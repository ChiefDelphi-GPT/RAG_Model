We are programming with YAGSL 2025.\n\nWe got a swerve drive working in the fall, using YAGSL 2024.  We are using the same modules and encoders (two NEOs got swapped out), copy-pasted our 2024 code into the 2025 template, and we aren’t able to get meaningful movements.\n\nIf no input is given, the wheels turn (not necessarily in the same direction); if we push forward on the joystick, the wheels drive but the turning oscillates in a range of probably 30 degrees.  The oscillation is kind of like a lawn sprinkler, where it turns one way then snaps back to the original position, and repeats that motion.  Probably something like two or three oscillations per second. @UnofficialForth has some videos of this movement, and probably a better explanation of what we’re experiencing.\n\nWe’ve gone through the YAGSL Eight Steps; we’ve tried inverting the motors through the SparkMAXes; we’ve tried every combination of True and False in the .json files for our swerve modules; we’ve triple and quadruple checked our wiring, CAN routing, CAN identification, and mechanical assembly.  It’s super frustrating because it worked fine on the 2024 YAGSL ; what has changed in the new version?\n\nI am not a programmer; we don’t currently have a programming mentor on our team; we’ll do the best we can to relay advice gained here to our students and try to figure this out.\n\nCode",

They have been significantly tuned back.\n\n@BlueEpiphone I was told you might be able to help.\n\nThe issue that is appearing is that, when driven in a direction, the wheels oscillate back and further. This initially seems like a PID tuning issue, until you realize that in fact, it’s not oscillating around the setpoint, but rather between setpoints.\n\nWhen the swerve module is asked to turn to an angle, it can also choice to turn to its complement and reverse wheel direction. Turning less is ideal. However, it  has the potential to create a wicked bug along the way. If a PID controller output turns the motor away from the setpoint rather than towards it, it will start to “run away” in the wrong direction. However, specifically in swerves, as it runs the wrong direction, the swerve module will consequently realize the complement is closer and change its setpoint to that. This causes the PID to change directions again and oscillate. (If you prefer video explanations, I’ll attach them below)\n\nPart 1: https://photos.app.goo.gl/tU8e6MbbvtTrqPoq6\n\nPart 2: https://photos.app.goo.gl/iFFCmFynMrNBsBS48\n\nPart 3: https://photos.app.goo.gl/RF1UGK5cU5bNEWLg7\n\nI solved this exact issue on the Purdue RI3D teams robot this year, but they weren’t using Yagsl, so I was able to just manually add a negative to the PID output. Since Yagsl is read only, we can’t use that same trick. We are looking for suggestions of how to solve this issue.\n\nInverting the motor doesn’t work btw",

I can tell you this, add the following code to your SwerveSubsystem.java just before setting up your swerve drive, line 37. This is why you’re not seeing the detailed output. You can set it to a lower setting later (INFO or POSE). If you do that and then go through the detailed setup steps that determine drive motor, absolute encoder and angle inversion, it may help.\n\nStart with everything to false, so un-inverted. Then, make sure all your modules are facing the same direction by ensuring they all have their wheel bolt-heads facing to robot left (need some kind of convention). Ensure that when rolled in the robot-forward direction, you get positive encoder output for each motor, else invert that drive motor. Then, check the absolute encoder reads positive increase in the CCW rotation direction for each module, else invert the absolute encoder on that module. Then ensure that the angle motor has positive output in the CCW direction for each module, else invert the angle motor.\n\nI don’t know if you’ve seen my Purdue Forums presentation, but this is the method I use for a robot with ThriftySwerve v1 with ThriftyEncoders. Yet Another Generic Swerve Presentation - Google Slides\n\nIf you feel like you’ve successfully done all that and it looks right, if @UnofficialForth ’s explanation is correct, I suppose you could try negating your angle-kP to introduce a negation into the PID ? That’s a last-resort, lol.\n\nAlso tagging @nstrike to see if anything jump out at him. Nothing jumps out at me as being too off.",

We were able to piece together most of the info to make sure that everything was reading positive, but we will have them do it again today at school.\n\nI’m 85% sure we tried negating the angle-kP, and it didn’t work because Rev motors don’t like negative P terms. Since the only other place to negate is within Yagsl, which is read-only (for a good reason) we hit a dead end.\n\nThey already got YAGSL working once in the off-season with this exact same set up, except for a few replacements of Neo motors and using the 2024 verison; They have been successful before.\n\n@Taylor Have them try all of @BlueEpiphone proposed solutions again, just in case I missed something.",
