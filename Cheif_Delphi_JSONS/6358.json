However, I couldn’t find a specific thread on here related to reliability on the software end. So, how do teams create robust software, what testing methods (physical robot testing, unit tests, sims or even static analysis) do teams use? Furthermore, how do teams handle errors when they come up to attempt to reduce their scope  and fix them later. I’ve seen the common recommendations of how to reduce electrical and mechanical risk, but not many on making your software bulletproof.",

Scenarios that would be hard / risky to create on the robot. If your code fully works in sim (bonus if it’s a direct motor sim, like CTRE ’s sim), then there are pretty much no logic errors to be had on the real robot. There may be some, of course, but most of it (and maybe all of it) will be found in sim, the only thing left on the robot being calibrations.\n\nReadability and clean code - if you follow a specific set of code rules, extract to as many functions as possible, and create easy to understand code (and I’m not talking about comments. The code itself should express intent), you’re going to create code where the problems are pretty obvious. And when they do show up, you’ll solve them easily.\n\nIn the end, your code will probably never work perfectly first try. To create bulletproof code, just test and use your robot as much as possible (in sim, or IRL).",

                    "cooked": "You asked for “robust practices” akin to mechanical/electrical tips and tricks (like hot-gluing everything). So here’s my take on something like that for software.\n\nThis is where language choice and language features can have an impact.\n\nYou get some “Static Analysis” for “free” when you use compiled languages such as Java and C++, inherent in the type system. Leveraging this type system can make software more robust.\n\nThe basic idea is you write code such that if there were a logic error, the compiler will catch it.\n\nA really shining example of this is the C++ units library (and I’m sure the Java units library to a similar extent).\n\nA large class of errors you could have is thinking a floating point variable is one unit when its actually another (e.g. ft or meters). You could try to combat this with diligent variable names.\n\nNow, maybe when the code was written, getDistanceToSpeaker() returned a value in feet, but maybe someone refactors the vision code to use a different pose estimator and now it calculates things in meters. They might even realize this change and tried to fix it everywhere, but maybe this code exists on a parallel git branch to the refactor, so they get merged.\n\nThis code will now be erroneous and it might not even be obvious except for a mid-range of distances (really close and really far might end up aiming to a similar angle), so it may be hard to track down.\n\nYou can change this to use a unit-aware type which looks like this in C++\n\nIf getDistanceToSpeaker() returns a different unit, the compiler will automatically and correct convert it for you. If getDistanceToSpeaker() returns a raw float, the code won’t compile, and the user will be directed to fix it by explicitly declaring in code what unit-type to use, hopefully by modifying getDistanceToSpeaker\n\nA lot of beginner programmers see compiler errors as a hindrance, something preventing them from being productive, but what I try to instill is that the code IS wrong, and the compiler just told you why without you having to go through the trouble of deploying it to a live robot.\n\nSimilarly, I recommend enabling compiler warnings and having them be considered errors (-Wall -Werror). Not sure what the Java equivalent is. I’ve had a lot of crashes and sometimes infinite loops that were pointed out by ignored warnings.",

More specific examples for some items:\n\nLPryor:\n\ndon’t trust inputs to functions. Always range check your inputs\n\nBelow was posted recently and I immediately pointed my camera on a steady tripod at an AprilTag on the wall. Within a few minutes I got 4 bad margins for a good tag and a tag number 700 something. So much for thinking you can ignore 1 in a million.\n\nI know this sounds dumb but thoughts on wrapping robot code in a try catch\n\nLast year our robot disabled during a crucial match because of a 1 in a million error. Some how our limelight saw ApriTag 157 , and it caused an index out of bounds error that crashed our robot.\n\nLPryor:\n\nHandle error conditions appropriately, don’t just code for the happy path\n\nRepeating my advice from that thread - check for error conditions from libraries. All the motor controller functions return a status code directly or if they return another value then check the global status function return. Restart failed attempts\n\nLPryor:\n\nAvoid potentially unending loops in your code.\n\nbut limit that restart loop to a reasonable number like 5.\n\nAdd a timer to loops that you have to have but can’t put on a limiting counter.\n\nLPryor:\n\navoid “cute” expressions, where people try to condense code into an unreadable single line.\n\nThe java var was added to the language to encourage (lazy?) programmers to split too long statements. You don’t have to code this type but do split long statements. var might help to indicate this variable is a “temporary” one.\n\nLPryor:\n\nUsing meaningful naming conventions, comments, and indentation. Make your code readable\n\nRepeating the often made advice - think, code in the problem space and not the solution space. Use if (gamePieceInPosition) and not if (dio1) . Doing so has another benefit of being able to eliminate many code comments that likely weren’t made anyways.\n\nAnother point is refactor code immediately upon thinking of a better way or better variable name or better comment or better algorithm.\n\nAlso, remove “dead” commented out code from in-line soon after testing its better replacement code. If you don’t dare to delete code after it’s been replaced, then move it to the bottom of the file. Better yet may be to take advantage of the github/VSCode history to be able to resurrect old code if need be.\n\nIt’s all about making code easy to read by eliminating all the distractions even if those distractions broke your concentration for only milliseconds.",

Doing so has another benefit of being able to eliminate many code comments that likely weren’t made anyways.\n\nThis is the most important skill for a programmer.  Comments should only be used when it isn’t practical to write the code to read like what it does.  It is almost always possible.\n\nRemember, too, that a large project has multiple “levels” of problem-space and solution-space - the solution-space of one layer may be the problem-space of another.  Be intentional about which level your language is relative to - it depends on who you expect to be stuck using your signifiers .  The “problem space” of a logging utility may be the “solution space” of the telemetry code that uses it, for example.  The naming conventions in public and private methods should usually be somewhat different, for this reason.",
