Those teams that are using high-end visual recognition and have highly efficient mechanisms will likely be able to get cycle times way down relatively early in the season, somewhere in the 15-20 second range even against mid-field defense and in the 10-15 second range without it. It’s likely that we’ll see a fair number of these teams,maybe 10% at most district and regional events, higher at DCMPs and Worlds, given the availability of new hardware and knowledge to make this happen. From there, we’ll likely see a fairly large middle rank of teams in the broad 40-20 second range (starting slower and improving as the season goes on) that don’t have the capabilities to automate as much of the pickup and placement processes. And, of course, there will be the rookie and other low-resource teams that will have slower cycle times (or none) due to inexperience with complex systems and programming. What that translates to is a wide range of possible scores in terms of game pieces per match. For many district and regional qualifiers, we might well see matches with 20 or more pieces scored, but will also see them with a mere handful. At the higher levels of play (playoffs, DCMPs, Worlds) we’re all too likely to see a full 27 pieces scored in a lot of matches. I do think this will be a year with the maximum score being reached plenty of times.",
