Our goal is to always be pushing forward the software capabilities of the FRC community while making them more accessible to all teams.\n\nFor the 2023 FRC season we introduced Phoenix Pro: a new comprehensive API, firmware, and software tool collection for our latest CAN FD products. Our goal of introducing Phoenix Pro with a paid licensing model was to enable development of larger features and improvements that wouldn’t have been possible otherwise.\n\nWe also knew that in some ways Phoenix Pro would be a bit of an experiment. Paid software is new to FRC, so despite extensive preparation there would likely be growing pains or changes that needed to be made for future seasons. In addition the Phoenix Pro API is very different from the Phoenix 5 API due to the nature of the API improvements.\n\nStarting with our early beta releases we’ve sought to collect as much feedback as possible in a variety of ways, including:\n\nPhoenix Pro Beta Testers\n\nInitial Community Response\n\nTechnical Support Requests throughout the season\n\nDiscussions with teams during build and at events\n\nOngoing discussion by the community on Chief Delphi and Discord\n\nFRC Championship Event feedback\n\nActive Post-Season feedback requests\n\nBased on this feedback we have a major change to announce for Phoenix Pro:\n\nThe initial release of the Phoenix 6 API is currently available - see our full announcement page at the link below or see our latest software documentation for instructions. Please note that Phoenix Pro firmware features will still require a paid Phoenix Pro license for use with Phoenix 6.\n\nWe’re excited for even more folks to get access to our best library yet and look forward to what teams can accomplish for the 2024 season!\n\nFor more information about what led to this change, how to access and use Phoenix 6, and details on which features will be exclusive to Phoenix Pro, see our full information page here:",

If so, what happens if the user attmets to use a feature such as FOC that is unavailable without pro Firmware? Does the code crash or control request fail with a StatusCode? Or does it simply fallback to using a similar but supported version of the request (i.e. trapezoidal control instead of FOC). Furthermore, is there a way in code to determine what the licensing state of a given device is from code so as to determine what features are supported? While I understand the individual user is likely to be aware of what  license they are running, I am asking these questions from the perspective of someone who has to maintain a library that is heavily dependent on bolth pheonix 5 and pro, and therfore the same general classes will have to work for both pro and stadard licenses, eventhough I still want to take advantage of pro features in supported devices. However, regardless of these questions, I am very excited for Phoenix 6 and the features it will offer!",

There’s no intent for product support to be discontinued on the SRX/SPX.\n\nkylelanman:\n\nI’d really like to see the api changes extend to the TalonSRX and VictorSpX.\n\nAutumn-Ou:\n\nIs there a reason for not moving talon SRX and Victor SPX controllers over to the new API\n\nWe agree that this would be useful - unfortunately there are other factors that make this extremely difficult.\n\nI originally discussed some of this on Discord after our attempts to bring better units to Phoenix v5 a few years ago, and I can summarize it a bit - essentially, to make changes to the units of Phoenix (in a way that doesn’t cause more confusion than it solves) requires substantial changes at every level of the software and firmware.\n\nThis is the reason the Quality-of-Life features like units/timestamps/signals were only introduced in the new API, and why they can’t easily be backported to Phoenix v5.\n\nThe corollary is that to bring products forward into the v6 API requires their firmware to be completely re-written from the ground up.  While this was an obvious choice to make for our most recent products, the usage rates of brushed controllers and other older products make it a difficult decision to invest the substantial effort required.  The additional limitation of these older products not having the hardware required for CAN FD further impacts that.\n\nThat’s not to say we would never bring those products forward, but it’s not currently on our roadmap.\n\nRomanTechPlus:\n\nthe same classes in the phoenix 6 API will be used gor both Phoenix Pro and non pro licenced devices?\n\nCorrect\n\nRomanTechPlus:\n\nIf so, what happens if the user attmets to use a feature such as FOC that is unavailable without pro Firmware?\n\nThe firmware will automatically fall back to the closest non-Pro alternative.  In the case of FOC this means falling back to traditional trapezoidal commutation; in the case of something like Fused CANcoder, this means falling back to a traditional Remote CANcoder usage.\n\nAdditionally an appropriate StatusCode will be returned (where possible) and an error message will be reported to the DS console.\n\nFor features that don’t have a non-Pro alternative (such as TorqueCurrentFOC control) the device will not enable and will set an explicit Fault & Sticky Fault, and will also blink the ‘unlicensed’ blink code (Red/Green).\n\nNote that the only features that don’t have a non-Pro alternative are the Torque output control modes; any future features that may not have a direct fallback will have a behavior appropriate to the feature.\n\nRomanTechPlus:\n\nFurthermore, is there a way in code to determine what the licensing state of a given device is from code so as to determine what features are supported?\n\nNot in the current release, but it’s on our high-priority list for addition in the off-season.\n\nRight now to check license status you would need to look at the device entry in Phoenix Tuner X.",

Ultimately this can result in ugly scenarios like this (this function takes in a PIDVS constants class and a slot number): image 462×530 38.4 KB\n\nimage 462×530 38.4 KB\n\nimage 462×530 38.4 KB\n\nThat redundant code suggests to me there’s probably a better way to do this; i.e. a single SlotConfig class that does all the current ones do, but stores the slot number in the class , allowing you to construct something like new SlotConfig(slotNum) and apply the configuration from there. It would simplify code that relies on being able to cleanly pass in parameters.\n\nThe migration docs refer to feedforward as kF while the API refers to it as kV. Small nitpick but did confuse me a bit.\n\nIn a similar vein to the old system of voltage compensation, to simplify being able to switch between voltage compensation and no voltage compensation, it would make sense (to me at least) to have single classes for each closed-loop type and have a parameter for voltage compensation, rather than explicit classes.",
