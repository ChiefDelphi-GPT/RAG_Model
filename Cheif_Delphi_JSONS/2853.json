                    "cooked": "Hey everyone, this is going to be a long thread about optimizing autonomous motions for scoring as much coral as possible when loading from the station. We have a few questions, but hopefully this can serve as a thread for teams looking to make the most of autos for DCMP and Champs.\n\nOur team has made several improvements to our autonomous from our week 1 event to week 4. Mainly increasing our elevator speeds. We had a 2 coral auto in week 1, now we have a 2.5 in week 4.\n\n(We are 3546 btw) Week 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_mG1IgphFM&t=1s Week 4: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9J4XkBDC5E&t=1s\n\nWe want to hit 3 coral for DCMP , but we had a few challenges to overcome.\n\nWhen we increased the speed of the drivetrain, the elevator would sway slightly and the drivetrain would not align close enough to the target pose.\n\nEven with our slow speeds, if autonomous ended and the elevator was up, the robot would come very close to tipping over.\n\nI’m curious to hear what others are doing for auto to keep their robot from tipping, and driving to paths accurately. I see a lot of teams driving quickly to the Reef, then raising their elevator and moving slowly. Is this something we should try to adopt? Our elevator is not the fastest, so I don’t know if this is the path we want to adopt (I may be wrong with comparing the speeds to other teams, so let me know if our elevator does look plenty quick to do this).",

That will make it less tippy.\n\nBut yes, your general idea is correct, raising the elevator after lining up so that you are only going in a straight line will keep it from skewing your alignment. I.e. quickly do any maneuvering with the elevator down and then do a simultaneous elevator lift while driving straight toward the scoring position.\n\nI also highly recommend adding vision for the final alignment to correct any errors that occur while lining up.",
