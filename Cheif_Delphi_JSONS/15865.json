We are using a 1\" wide x 28\" long x 1/8\" thick carbon fiber sheet and we want this arm to spin around in one direction and block it from rotating in the opposite direction. We want this to be very low profile and light. Therefore, we do not want to use a ratchet or the Versaplanetary Ratchet Kit. I was looking at one-way bearings, but the torque of the arm will be very high (since we are trying to lift about 20-40lbs of force, for that reason, I am worried about them slipping without the use of a thread locker or something similar. Does anyone have any suggestions for the best type of one-way bearing mechanism that can be mounted directly into the carbon fiber? We would prefer something off the shelf if possible. Thanks!",

It was a solid way to do and with a proper press fit held up like a champ all season and through almost two additional years of demo use. We mounted ours in a solid hunk of 1/2” thick aluminum, with a very precise bore.\n\nOne of the big things to consider in my opinion with a one way bearing is how you plan to reset the mechanism. We didn’t fully think this through then, and ended up pneumatically actuating the gearbox to disconnect the bevels holding the winch back. In retrospect, I suspect we could have found a cleaner way of doing this. You almost certainly do want to move the arm back at some point, unless you plan to use it only once all season.\n\nHonestly I would probably suggest going a different route, but you likely will need an additional piece to hold the press fit bearing, and then attach that to your carbon fiber bit.\n\nGood luck this season!",

Unless you’re going to use its properties in an interesting way (e.g. making a monocoque shell that transmits loads in efficient ways), and know what you’re doing, don’t fall for the CF meme. You’re just asking for splinters, annoyances, and empty bank account. We built light racecars out of aluminum (and still do); aluminum is wonderful.\n\nAnd then you’re talking about… press fitting a bearing into the CF? With an adhesive that may-or-may-not be compatible with the epoxy resin holding the CF together…\n\nFRCStudent:\n\nthe torque of the arm will be very high (since we are trying to lift about 20-40lbs of force, for that reason, I am worried about them slipping without the use of a thread locker or something similar.\n\nMcMaster-Carr ← needle-roller one-way bearings themselves will not support 20-40 pounds of force on a 28\" lever arm.\n\nI suppose there are these style: McMaster-Carr But then you’ll need to machine some press-fit housings and shafts.\n\nWhat sort of machining resources do you have access to? Don’t sacrifice to the weight- and profile- saving gods if you don’t even have the equipment to do so.",

Anything that satisfies even three of the first four requirements won’t satisfy the last, though in FRC terms, $80 isn’t that expensive.\n\nEighty bucks is about the price of a planetary gearbox with motor. The properly-machined chunk of hardened steel to use as a “puck” machined with a (presumably hex but maybe keyed) hole for a shaft might cost you nearly that much if you can’t make it in-house. So, depending on your capability, this bearing and “puck” will run you about the cost of one or two gearboxes.\n\nIf it’s worth it, spend the money.

Never did end up building the thing, but the option is really nice–your ratcheting mechanism is smaller than your dog gear, and weighs even less.",
