It was partly disassembled for some aggressive drive practice and the elusive kraken motors. Snapback was loosely based around 254’s omni-feeding pizza box idea.

Albeit the new offseason robot progress is slow there are many things that we do.\n\nWe got our outreach robot all* fixed up and its ready to shoot notes at our misbehaving members again! (For legal reasons thats a joke)(Also the notes are very soft and do not hurt) *One of the pizza ring Falcon 500’s has very low torque (could be burnt up?) and has made the omni feeding very hard\n\nUnfortunately, there will be no Robots@CNE this year, as a team we are grief-stricken.\n\nBut we are excited for Robots@ ! Thank you to the team there for all that they do to make this event happen.\n\nWe have finalized the BOM for the competition robot. Other than that no other updates, keeping our fingers crossed for when Kraken x44’s and x60’s to come back in stock soon so we can snag some for our robot.\n\nBy technicality, our team was 1 week behind schedule now that Robots@? has been pushed back we are 2 weeks ahead of schedule. Work slower and you’ll be rewarded with more time. But in all/half seriousness if we keep this pace up we will either be around 10 weeks behind schedule or 20+ weeks ahead of schedule.\n\nOur competition season robot may undergo some changes and we discovered that it can do this:\n\nSurely we can fit a deep climb there? We’ll have to see.\n\nWe have organized our shop. It used to look like a pigsty. (Imagine the same image but with 2 more tables and stuff everywhere)  Thank you to our parents for doing this. image 1226×919 139 KB image 1226×919 135 KB\n\nimage 1226×919 139 KB\n\nimage 1226×919 139 KB\n\nimage 1226×919 135 KB\n\nimage 1226×919 135 KB\n\nThank you for reading this, we know this doesn’t get seen much but we appreciate the community for being so welcoming.\n\nUs during the CNE cancellation announcement not reading carefully:\n\nWritten by: @Overclockedfyre -\n\nWritten by: @Overclockedfyre -",

So here are a few following things:\n\nOur prototyping has started on the hand/arm subsystem. This is the current progress of our hand/arm:\n\nWe had a few issues with coral getting stuck when entering horizontally, however, we have fixed it with our recent revision. Here’s a video:\n\nWe have assembled all stages and found out our string isn’t long enough. Stay tuned for following updates, here’s a video in the meantime:\n\nWe blew up our climber… however we adjusted our string attachment method and it works now. Video of it working:\n\nWe have started our design on our bumpers and it is still a work in progress, we are deciding between 1, 2, and 4 piece bumpers and also different attachment methods. We mounted the swerve modules onto the base as well as the general frame. We are waiting for our baseplate to be cut to further our progress.\n\nOverall, we have made significant progress on our offseason robot so far, and we hope to see you all at Robots at Mary Ward!\n\nWritten by: @Spoon2 -\n\nWritten by: @Spoon2 -",

Thanks to Sable and Tri-M for cutting these parts.

Waiting on Metal plates for it.\n\nSuper Pinch works with the krakenx44, it’s quite secure, the belt is in the tube to avoid damage and it looks nicer.\n\nWritten by: @Overclockedfyre -\n\nWritten by: @Overclockedfyre -",

Also, CNC router.\n\nWe identified a failure point in our bot, which happens if the coral falls in the coral basket sideways. With the climber installed, it is probably going to be near impossible to shake the coral out. While this is very unlikely, as it would require both missing a coral and said coral falling perfectly into the basket, if it happens we would just be turned into an algae bot.\n\nIMG_20250826_214923150_HDR 801×601 91.2 KB\n\nIMG_20250826_214923150_HDR 801×601 91.2 KB\n\nIMG_20250826_214923150_HDR 801×601 91.2 KB\n\nIMG_20250826_214821373_HDR 451×601 72.5 KB IMG_20250826_214844885_HDR 451×601 73.4 KB IMG_20250826_214905750_HDR 451×601 74.1 KB router 556×741 48 KB\n\nIMG_20250826_214821373_HDR 451×601 72.5 KB\n\nIMG_20250826_214821373_HDR 451×601 72.5 KB\n\nIMG_20250826_214844885_HDR 451×601 73.4 KB\n\nIMG_20250826_214844885_HDR 451×601 73.4 KB\n\nIMG_20250826_214905750_HDR 451×601 74.1 KB\n\nIMG_20250826_214905750_HDR 451×601 74.1 KB\n\nrouter 556×741 48 KB\n\nrouter 556×741 48 KB\n\nAll(except climber) subsystems work together fast! Our bot is able to intake coral and transfer into the hand. The hand is able to pivot and is raised by the elevator. Still waiting on metal plates for intake\n\nOur carbon fiber tie rods reduce side to side motion significantly, but can still wiggle a front and back. We might consider adding another rod to keep the elevator still\n\nFailure point that is very unlikely to happen (foreshadowing?)\n\nAll that is left is to redesign climber and let the coding team work their magic!\n\nWritten by: @skyd7520 - New user can’t post\n\nWritten by: @skyd7520 -\n\nNew user can’t post",

I’m assuming that you have the cutout in your coral basket to allow your claw to come in and grab the coral easier. If you add an elevation to one side and then add little triangle ramp pieces, you should be able to knock coral out of that space.\n\nBasically adding elevation to one side of the coral prevents it from getting fully jammed in that space, so that you can knock it put of the robot.\n\nIMG_2260 1920×1440 313 KB\n\nIMG_2260 1920×1440 313 KB\n\nIMG_2260 1920×1440 313 KB",
