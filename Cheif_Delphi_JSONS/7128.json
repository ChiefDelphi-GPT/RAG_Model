                    "cooked": "Hello! I’ve been working on a CAD design for a custom mecanum parallel plate drivetrain for FTC . I’m pretty inexperienced and have never done a custom drivetrain before. If anyone here could give me feedback on it, that would be greatly appreciated: Onshape\n\nSome parts are still missing, like pulleys for the drive wheels and belts. Everything is dead axle. The two square custom pieces: are for mounting optii odometry pods, but i’m not sure if we are going to use them. The main things i’m wondering are: Is connecting the two sides with REV extrusion a good idea? We are planning to use REV for the rest of the robot, but I don’t know if channel would be better.\n\nIs it going to be strong enough? It will be 1/8 inch aluminum\n\nDid I do pocketing correctly? Never done it before and don’t really know if I did it right.\n\nIs there anyway to make it thinner (the actual drive pods)? Does it need to be thinner?\n\nThank you for your help!\n\n(Edit: Moved to technical category. I’ve never posted here before, so if I did something wrong with this post, please tell me. Thanks!)",

We are planning to use REV for the rest of the robot, but I don’t know if channel would be better.\n\nEither should work! With extrusion like you currently have, it might help to add some more near the top of the drivetrain at the front and back (near the outside standoffs) to maintain rigidity along with providing mounting options, but this largely depends on the nature of your mechanisms. In some cases, this mounting could also be moved in between the parallel plates.\n\nC- or U-channel will give you both rigidity and mounting flexibility at once, albeit requiring slightly more thinking with where you place brackets on the inside plates.\n\n3943276968732:\n\nIs it going to be strong enough? It will be 1/8 inch aluminum\n\nThat’s plenty strong at FTC scale. As long as your standoffs are nice and strong (such as REV ones), you’ll have no problems with structure.\n\n3943276968732:\n\nDid I do pocketing correctly? Never done it before and don’t really know if I did it right.\n\nThe inside panels look great! For the outside ones, the main piece of advice I’d have is to follow the same kind of pocketing: stick to triangles or “triangle-ish” quadrilaterals, and keep struts consistent through the plate. Something like this could work:\n\nScreenshot 2024-03-25 at 01.26.49 1920×503 97.3 KB\n\nScreenshot 2024-03-25 at 01.26.49 1920×503 97.3 KB\n\nScreenshot 2024-03-25 at 01.26.49 1920×503 97.3 KB\n\n3943276968732:\n\nIs there anyway to make it thinner (the actual drive pods)? Does it need to be thinner?\n\nNot really for both. Dead axle usually tends to be pretty chunky by nature, but 16x16 is a good size that’ll keep you agile while still having ample mounting space.\n\nI also have a couple of smaller suggestions:\n\nYou’re extremely close (theoretically within an mm) to being high enough off the ground to clear a pixel. Note that It’ll likely be more than this accounting for tile sink at comp, so if you can, it’ll help your drivers to raise the bottom ~3-5mm off the ground, which you can do by simply making both sets of plates ~6-10mm smaller, height-wise.\n\nYou’re extremely close (theoretically within an mm) to being high enough off the ground to clear a pixel.

This is mounted, as the name suggests, perpendicular to the other pods, and tracks lateral movement (strafing) more accurately than drive encoders. Where this is mounted doesn’t really matter, as long as you know its offset from the center of rotation of the robot, which will likely be close to if not at its physical center.\n\nIf you do end up using odopods, make sure you have space for one perpendicular pod!

You can use the Lighten featurescript to do the heavy lifting for you! All you need to do is make the faces you want to pocket in a sketch, then choose the strut thickness and fillet radius, and it’ll pocket the piece for you. Featurescripts in general are an extremely versatile addition to Onshape and the reason I personally prefer it over Fusion, so I wanted to highlight this as an immediately relevant example. To name a few more examples, here are some gear , belt , and shaft generation featurescripts that are commonly used in FRC but have numerous FTC applications too (such as for turrets, swerve modules, and offset power transmission or PTOs).\n\nIt looks to me like you’re using manual pocketing, making the struts and stuff yourself.
