                    "cooked": "We are having an issue when connecting to the new radio from the driver station when having limelights being connected to the radio as well. Currently, our radio is wired using the REV radio power module connected to the RIO port on the radio. DIP switches 1 and 2 are set to off, and DIP switch 3 is set to on. We are running the newest firmware on the radio as well.\n\nWhen connecting to the driver station with only the RIO connected to the radio, we do not experience any connection issues, however when we plug in a limelight to any aux or the DS port, when see large spikes in latency in the DS logs and constant disconnects from the driver station to the robot. We have tried both directly connecting limelights to the AUX ports and using a brainbox to connect to the limelights as well. Both ways resulted in the same issue. We have also tried going back to the old radios to see if it is an isolated issue with the new radio, or if it is present with both, and the old radio worked like normal, not having the disconnect issues.\n\nI do want to note that at some point during the process, the radio was wired using both 12v from the PDH and 18v from the Rev radio power module. We haven’t ruled out if this is the culprit of the issue, but are open to any other suggestions on why this could be happening or how to fix it. We will be attending IRI later this week so any help for solutions is welcomed.",

I wasn’t involved in trouble shooting, but I believe the TL;DR is that the old radio had a very low hard cap on the bandwidth, whereas the new one doesn’t, and somewhere else in the process (driver station laptop, perhaps?), the extra data caused hiccups. I think we just disabled the feed to the laptop, since it wasn’t needed. I can pry more information from our programming team if needed, but I’d look there, since your issues sound VERY similar to what we were experiencing when trying to use the new radio at home (this issue did not happen in competition mode).",

The fact that one cannot reliably test one’s robot at home without (A) having two of these radios; and (B) hard-wiring the driver’s station to the wall-powered 2nd one, seems like a humongous miss.\n\nThe proposed answer not only requires teams to buy additional radios, but also requires us to basically build a new driver’s station that contains not just a laptop and a controller, but also contains its own radio, AND requires power to that driver’s station. In our shop, and I can’t imagine we’re the only ones, we generally have to test outdoors and far from power. Do I also understand that if we were to do this, we’d be violating FCC rules by broadcasting a 6GHz network outdoors?\n\nBetween this and having to handle the heat (holy crap it gets hot while it’s not working), it’s certainly not the compatible-with-the-old-one-but-better thing we were expecting. I hope there are new revisions that make this easier for teams.",

It was always and is today still an issue with the 2.4GHz band on the old radios, you just didn’t know it because video feeds and frames were simply dropped and devices non-functional for streaming. Add the upside that the new radio on its 6GHz band will blow previous BW limits and data throughput out of the water enabling all of this advancement to have a shot at working at higher resolutions and frame rates when configured correctly…pushes the new solution again ahead of today’s radios.\n\ncomparing apples to apples - the old radio and it’s forced BW limit made the expansion of cameras, multiple video feeds, etc…a problem brushed under the rug.
