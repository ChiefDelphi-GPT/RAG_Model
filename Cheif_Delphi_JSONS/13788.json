Both Technical (Code) and Mechanical (Wiring and Build), as we prep for off-season events.\n\nSome info about our robot.\n\nWe use tank drive Top heavy - When stopping the robot will tip back and forth. - Our lead mentor doesn’t want to make any major reworks for this issue. We use cims motors with sparks motor controllers-He is willing to swap out motor controllers as we have better ones\n\nThank you all, for any advice! -Team 8116",

You could also add some weight in your bumper since the bumper weight isn’t included in the 125lb weight limit.

Are you trying to increase overall performance? Solve one or more specific issues? Perhaps just do cool things and learn along the way?\n\nSounds like at least one specific problem:\n\nHubbaBubbaBubbleTape:\n\nWhen stopping the robot will tip back and forth.\n\nSpoiler alert, slew rate is the software-fix answer. But the “why” is interesting.\n\nIt’s a comon issue for high “center of mass” robots. The possible solutions fall out of doing a free-body diagram on the robot itself. It’s not extremely simple but still approachable. Here’s a simplified model:\n\nimage 848×517 8.45 KB\n\nimage 848×517 8.45 KB\n\nimage 848×517 8.45 KB\n\nForces involved:\n\nF_{a} , the force which is accelerating the robot’s mass forward or backward - what you generally want on the field.\n\nF_g , the downward force of gravity keeping the robot (hopefully) on the ground\n\nF_n , the upward force of the floor acting on the wheels to keep the robot from going through the ground.\n\nF_n is actually the sum of three forces - one from each wheel set as it supports the weight of the robot. This means that the net F_n force can change in magnitude and direction however it needs to for countering the other forces… but only up to a point. Wheels aren’t glued to the ground, so those three little component arrows can only be positive (point in the direction drawn). This means the maximum angle F_n can ever point is along the axis from one axis through the center of mass.\n\nWhen only one wheel is exerting any force, it starts to act as the pivot point for the center of mass, to rotate about that point. If you rotate too far, the robot tips.\n\nAssuming we’re operating right at the point before any motion occurs,  you have to balance the following free-body diagram for no motion:\n\nPresumably - the force of gravity is constant, and you want maximum robot mass. This means F_g is constant.\n\nFor a given \\theta_n , F_n 's magnitude will also have to be fixed to counter out F_g in the vertical axis. This in turn sets what F_a can be at this operating point.\n\nWhich leads to the two main engineering ways to prevent tip:\n\nLimit F_a so it will never exceed the magnitude of the horizontal component of F_n\n\nIncrease \\theta_n by moving the center of mass closer to the ground.\n\nSince 2 is already deemed out of scope, you’re left with 1 .\n\nTo a very simple model, drivetrain velocity is proportional to the voltage applied. A slew rate limiter limits the rate of change of voltage. Therefor, limiting the rate of change of voltage, you also limit the rate of change of velocity.\n\nSince acceleration is the rate of change of velocity, slew rate limiters (generally) limit acceleration.\n\nTherefor, a slew rate limiter on drivetrain commanded voltage achieves 1\n\n…\n\nNow, is it actually that simple? Nope. But can you ignore all the other stuff? Probably! Just pick a slightly more conservative rate limit.\n\nengineering",
