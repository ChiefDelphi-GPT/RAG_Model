Our team is a part of the Queen City Robotics Alliance (QCRA), a non-profit organization we helped found, that supports Charlotte area FIRST teams.\n\nCurrently we are in our off-season after a successful 2025 season where we won the FIRST Impact Award at UNC Asheville and the North Carolina District Championship, along with the Team Sustainability Awards in our division at the FIRST World Championship.\n\nSo far we’ve tried to eliminate our use of an OrangePi for vision processing by running Photon Vision on Systemcore, but based on another team’s testing where one camera with a 2D AprilTag pipeline made the CPU usage jump from 25-30% to 65-70%. We decided that our 2 cameras that use 3D pipelines would be smoother on our OrangePi and keep the CPU usage on the main robot controller low.\n\nJust sharing my experience getting PhotonVision running on SystemCore. Installation is very simple, just copy the PhotonVision JAR onto the device and create a systemd service to run it as root. Wi...\n\nMore on our SystemCore adventures, we’re planning on testing the necessity of a CANivore. Our team has all the motors and sensors that are a part of our drivetrain on a separate CANbus added by the CANivore to improve speed and control when driving, as well as to protect the drivetrain in case any devices on the main CANbus break. We’d like to test whether or not using a CANivore or 2 CANchains on SystemCore works better. A major problem we faced this season with the roboRIO was CPU usage issues due to vision processing. The SystemCore is much more powerful compared to the roboRIO and we are testing if those issues will be solved with the new robot controller.\n\nA lot of our work with SystemCore as of now is preparing for it to be used on our competition robot for offseason events. As a team, we are focusing on training rookies and undergoing a strategic redesign of our REEFSCAPE robot, Beluga, that incorporates SystemCore and is more competitive for said events.\n\nKeep in mind we won’t have regular updates due to SystemCore not being on the robot yet!\n\nIn addition to the electrical changes brought about by SystemCore, we plan to re-wire a lot of the robot for cleaner wire management and as practice for new members of the team. We’ve designed a new end effector for our offseason competitions after many strategic redesign workshops. This end effector is meant to give us both coral and algae capabilities using super-pinch, something we weren’t able to fully utilize during the actual season. We are trying it with a 20:1 gear ratio on the intake rollers for torque to pinch algae.\n\nIntaking ALGAE 1065×855 145 KB Intaking CORAL 749×654 93.3 KB\n\nIntaking ALGAE 1065×855 145 KB\n\nIntaking ALGAE 1065×855 145 KB\n\nIntaking CORAL 749×654 93.3 KB\n\nIntaking CORAL 749×654 93.3 KB\n\nOn the programming side of our team, we are rewriting our auto-align code, which is crucial for fast cycles in this game, and creating a simulation sandbox for future robot projects. Simulation is a tool we heavily utilized this season, for anything from camera placements to logic for our game piece manipulator system. We were able to simulate camera feeds using PhotonVision and AdvantageScope’s 3D Field, which greatly sped up our programming process. With a custom 3D model of our robot, we were able to quickly test logic code despite its four degrees of freedom.\n\nOur first offseason event is SCRAP, in Camden, South Carolina on August 23rd. Stay tuned for more updates and please ask questions below!",
