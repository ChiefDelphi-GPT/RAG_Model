I’ve made a previous post about this before, but I’ve been wondering what are your thoughts on these two types of alignment, and in your opinion, which one for your team is more reliable or effective? One approach relies on an accurate global pose estimate (vision + odometry or other means) to align to a preset, field-relative goal pose with left and right offsets. The other approach involves aligning to a single tag (or multiple, with one distinguished) that the camera is tracking and then creating offsets from that tag-relative pose. I’m considering these methods and am unsure which is more effective. Our current setup consists of three Limelights: two Limelight 3s mounted on the front and left side of the robot for pose estimation, and one Limelight 2, centered middle-low, serving as a single-tag tracker at preferably low distances.",

There are a lot of little lessons that go into that template.\n\nIf you’re just doing this for the first time and want to keep it simple, then using just the limelights is a lot easier to understand. You will still want to be careful about how it handles apriltags when you’re really close and really far away (both lead to different errors) But there is a post called zero to reef alignment (or something similar) on here that should get you 90% of the way there.",

If you can’t get global pose good enough for fine branch alignment, you may still want to use it to get you close on the reef or for other purposes.\n\nThis is our approach. Use the global pose to get to where we can see the reef tag and then position relative to just that tag. This insulates us from any potential deviations in the reef’s position or orientation w.r.t. the field. In our experience this was much less of an issue on the competition field than on the various fields we have practiced on.  But if another robot bumps and moves the reef during practice our autons don’t care.  This is pretty helpful.  It also means we are super flexible with our auton start positions (a good thing).",
