                    "cooked": "Hi all,\n\nWe’re using a CANdle to drive a 16x16 addressable LED array. The CANdle library has a basic setColor() that takes a starting LED and number of LEDs to set to a given RGB(w) value. Right now we just use the array for basic status to the driver, so all LEDs are the same color based on whatever status we want to display.\n\nI’d like to do much more with the display. Ideally, I’d really like to pass a 256-entry array of on/off values (all of which can be the same color). There’s a slightly more advanced setColor() that takes a start and length and will set those LEDs to the given color. However, worse case, I would still have to call that 256 times if every other LED were on for example.\n\nI’d like to avoid having to call setColor() in a loop. Is there anything better than doing that that I missed?\n\nThanks",

Then you can use the buffer set options of AddressableLED which sounds like exactly what you want.",

You want to send your patterns out the CANdle port but somehow patterns are still generated by your programming.\n\nI haven’t tied the two together so I don’t know the details but we’ve used both methods of driving the patterns to the LEDs.\n\nYou may be wanting a simple way to magically turn LEDs on/off. No - they are independent LEDs but you (or someone does) write methods to handle the repetitive looping. For example there is unlikely a method readily available to light every other LED so write one yourself. It’s fairly straight forward and you’ve already done something like it. Make all the lights black - usually with one statement. Loop through the buffer 0 to 255 incrementing by 2 and setting the color. Make the method more general purpose by accepting an increment amount.\n\nIf you are doing animation that isn’t performed in the LED driver then the colors do have to be refreshed every cycle. Not sure but I’d bet the CANdle is not doing the animation but the CTRE roboRIO library is.",
