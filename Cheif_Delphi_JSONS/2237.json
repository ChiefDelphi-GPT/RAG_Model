After formatting the batteries appropriately, we standardize our BD250 testing at 20 A to a terminating voltage of 10.8. We test all batteries before competition and rank them for use based on the measured capacity.\n\nWe rely on the battery beak for testing at comp. Quick and easy.\n\nWe have not found a good use for the cold crank testing. We’ve looked for correlations between the cold crank amp test results with BD250 capacity results and not found any correlations.   Any suggestions?  Comments welcome.\n\nEven with the above approach, we infrequently  experience brown-out conditions during competition.  At this point we are trying to determine whether the brown out is due to the battery capabilities, or whether the bot’s demands exceed the battery’s capabilities.  Therefore I am posting the following questions for consideration.\n\nFirst, any flaws or recommendations with the above approach?\n\nFirst, any flaws or recommendations with the above approach?\n\nWondering whether anyone has developed a way to measure the load on the battery during comp.  For example, logging the current draw from the battery during comp, find the area under the current vs time curve for that particular competition and using this as a method to measure total load on that battery during that match.\n\nWondering whether anyone has developed a way to measure the load on the battery during comp.  For example, logging the current draw from the battery during comp, find the area under the current vs time curve for that particular competition and using this as a method to measure total load on that battery during that match.\n\nWe have no way to test the batteries in a competition-like condition.  Has anyone ever developed a program that cycles the bot through a standardized set of motions and operations to a predetermined cutoff voltage, and used the time to that cutoff voltage to rank the battery capability?  This may be overkill, but the concept is one that is interesting to toy around with.\n\nWe have no way to test the batteries in a competition-like condition.

Seems like a reasonable approximation of a low-medium robot electrical load. I’d like 100A to make the later analysis and math simple but didn’t see a battery capacity tester off-the-shelf that could do that without modification or making my own - which although would be fun I don’t have time for lol.\n\nIf a battery is suspect mid-season that would be a reason to capacity re-test, but this is our first year more thoroughly testing so that situation hasn’t arisen yet.\n\nDebating periodic battery-beak measurements during comp, as well as figuring out how to reliably log the match power data to then combine with all other data sources and have a “realtime” health report of the batteries and watch them change over time.",

Also in this document, on page 3 of the .pdf, are charts of temperature performance.\n\nimage 792×755 104 KB\n\nimage 792×755 104 KB\n\nimage 792×755 104 KB\n\nAnderson also has a very nice technical note on how to read / interpret these charts .\n\nThe different temperature ratings in the datasheet are with respect to different standards. I found an old copy of the UL 1977 standard , which describes testing with constant current for 4 hours to ensure that the connector does not exceed the temperature rating of any of the insulators in the connector, and that it can break 150% of the rated current at least 50 times. (Unfortunately I don’t have $400 to read the latest version of the UL standard, but these things usually only get minor revisions over the years.)\n\nI couldn’t easily find the relevant CSA standard ( their website seems to be down at the moment), but Anderson’s technical note describes it as only allowing a 30°C temperature rise above the ambient temperature of 25°C, rather than however much the insulators are rated to take.\n\nAll of this is to say that, under most FRC circumstances, it is fine to put a lot more than 50 amps through an Anderson SB50 connector – 50 amps is just the most conservative rating, which is okay under pretty much all circumstances.",
