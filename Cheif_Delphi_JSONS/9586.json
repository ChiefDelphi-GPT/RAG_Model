                    "cooked": "Team 3472 Buluk is proud to present our first Swerve Drive design, Tlaczani which means Agility in Nahuatl.\n\nWe’ve been working on our own swerve drive for almost two years now. Tlaczani is our third iteration and the first one we are confident in to use on competition.\n\nNow, even though we’ve been working on it for a while it is still on a somewhat early stage of prototyping so every tip, comment or suggestion to help us immprove our design are more than welcome.\n\nOur objective with this swerve drive was for it to be as cheap and easy to manufacture as possible, our school provided us with a lot of tools and machines which really helped us to reduce the costs of manufacturing. For the materials we chose aluminium due to its light weight, but mainly because we had a supplier that would sell us the aluminium by the kilo, which meant that all the blocks that we needed for the four modules would cost us around 30 dolars. The second material which was the expensive one is markforged’s Onyx, this one at the beggining we weren’t so sure to use it, but various mechanical engeneering teachers from our school recommended it to us and said it was strong enough, although we haven’t tested it thoroughly we feel that it si strong enough to withstand the stress of competition, if anyone has tested or has experience with how Onyx withstands at competitions, please let use know. Regarding the cost, buying one 800cc spool costed us a bit more than 300 dolars, we are aware that it was very expensive but the postive side was that we were getting the material for all four modules at the same price that a single SDS or REV module would cost us.
