I think the wait command won’t work, as it runs at the command scheduler rate.  The WpiLib timer doesn’t have an interrupt when finished.\n\nAny suggestions on how to do 1 shot control like this?  Use a notifier?  Spin a thread with Java’s timer.sleep()?",

                    "cooked": "So, for 98% percent of FRC problems, I agree, 20ms control is ok for most of the problems.  Although when you use hardware PID support, that runs at 1ms, so I don’t think my request is unreasonable.\n\nProblem statement: We have an analog pneumatic cylinder powering our shooter.  You put air in one side, it goes up, then you trap the air in it and it holds it spot.  (a couple check valves will vent air on system release to comply with R813A)\n\nRight now, we use a bang-bang controller, basically turn on the solenoid until you reach the angle requested (actually a couple degrees before because of inertia).  This is causing problems, as we can’t get much better than about 3-4* of control.  You can even watch it wave at us trying to aim… https://youtu.be/oQ7fzUgCELM?si=cqAuj5gHElzpDZpk&t=44 On blue at center of stage.\n\nSo we thought about changing to a feed-forward control, where we would basically calculate how long we would have to fire it (based on ramp rate, sensor delay, activation time, etc) before we stop the solenoid.  You can’t PID the solenoid, as there is no analog control, and you can’t PWM it either.  This is the only solution I can think of that might work.  Maybe 20ms timing is ok, but you can see it bounce a lot to try and find the target with feedback control.\n\n(I think it adjust from 30-55* in about 1 second, and our flow restrictors are basically as far as they go in.  You don’t want to lower pressure really, as this mechanism is a balance of force already, and you remove the flow restrictors and the mechanism just drops).",

At these frequencies, OS scheduling jitter alone can be an issue, let alone GC pauses.  It might be in C++, but fundamentally OS jitter (and CAN bus variable latency) becomes a limiter here.  I think 971 (using a bunch of custom C++ code and very careful management of threading priorities, etc) got there for their “kicker” a couple years ago, but I don’t think they used CAN .\n\nSteven_Carmain:\n\nRight now, we use a bang-bang controller, basically turn on the solenoid until you reach the angle requested (actually a couple degrees before because of inertia).\n\nWould Solenoid.setPulseDuration() fit the bill with some inner/outer loop work?  That allows pretty precise control of each solenoid pulse.  The precise pulse duration would be controlled by the PCM /PH, with an outer control loop telling it how long to pulse (the PH allows control within 1 ms).  It would require a lot of tuning because most solenoid valves have a minimum pulse duration needed to even open the valve, but I assume you already know that.",
