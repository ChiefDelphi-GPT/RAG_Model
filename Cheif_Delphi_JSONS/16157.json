I am happy to answer any questions!\n\nOur swerve drive automatically handles failures and calibrations. If an azimuth module fails, we switch the motor to coast mode, disable the drive motor for the affected module, and remove the module from the robot pose calculations. To prevent the swerve modules from opposing each other, we slow down any module that is going against the others. We also can easily correct misaligned swerve modules by zeroing and recalibrating them from the dashboard. Additionally, we assist the driver by locking the robot’s orientation at high speeds, which prevents the robot from drifting and helps when they go under the control panel. We also automatically control whether the swerve drive is in robot-oriented or field-oriented mode based on driver inputs and emergency overrides. Finally, we use customizable driver profiles so each driver can have personalized settings.\n\nEach module shifts independently. We use two photointerrupters on each module to determine the real shifter state the robot is in and compare this state to our requested shifter state. Using this information, we can determine whether the robot is in high or low gear so that we can use the correct conversion factors. We can also compare the requested and actual shifter states to know when we are transitioning between gears, stutter the shifter if it gets stuck while transitioning, and detect any shifter failures. To estimate our pose, we fuse the sensor readings from the Falcon encoders, IMU, and Limelight. The pose is also used to latch the azimuth angles during deceleration to prevent the robot tipping from at high speeds.\n\nFor general module failures: We detect an azimuth fault if the error from the goal is over a threshold for a certain amount of time (if the sensor is unplugged or a gearbox failure). When this occurs, we disable the power to the module, force to coast so the module won’t be opposing the other working modules, and remove this module’s odometry from our pose calculations. This allows us to continue driving with only 3 modules for the remainder of the match. We are also using the thermocouples on the Falcons to detect if one of the motors is overheating. We detect these errors individually for each module and have indicators on our driver station so we know which module caused the error.\n\nFor shifter failures: We compare the real shifter state (determined with the 2 photointerrupters on each module) with the requested shifter state (what the robot wants to be in). If these states don’t match for a certain time threshold, we stutter the shifter to try to get the piston to engage, and if that doesn’t fix the problem, we detect a shifter failure. If we have a shifter failure on a module, we force the modules to low gear.\n\n2021 season’s repo: https://github.com/secret-city-wildbots/2021-Summer-Rogue\n\nBefore a match, our autonomous program loads a text file of commands to execute the autonomous play. We parse these user-input commands into parallel drive and subsystem instruction sequences. These commands have multiple modes including a configurable delay that enables us to synchronize with our alliance partners. To drive complex paths, we created a custom path planner that lets the user specify multiple waypoints, velocities, and orientations that the robot must reach. Our path planner automatically smooths sharp turns and limits the robot’s acceleration during these paths. Our LabVIEW path follower is a pure-pursuit algorithm (see more info below). It includes both a feed-forward controller that calculates our goal location along the path and a feed-back controller that compensates for the inherent errors in following the path.\n\nOnce we finish writing a play or path, we can immediately test autonomous even while our robot is stationary on the cart. This autonomous test mode allows us to simulate or bypass crucial sensor readings, such as the IMU and LimeLight. Because the robot was stationary on the cart, we had difficulty visualizing its estimated position on the field. We created a map that displays the path the robot took, either using the physical sensors during a match or simulated sensor readings in test mode. To help us easily debug any problems, we record this path, audible warnings, and the robot’s status during each match. Our guiding design principle has been to allow us to develop new auto plays and paths “in the que line” and have them complete successfully during the match without any testing on the field.\n\nOn the field, our robot estimates its position (pose) by constantly fusing data from multiple sensors, including the IMU, swerve drive encoders, and swerve azimuth encoders. We update this position estimate with our LimeLight and LIDAR (laser range finder) readings, when applicable. We continue to run our autonomous modes after the autonomous period of a match ends and until the driver moves the joystick. This feature allows us to leverage the crucial seconds between the end of autonomous and when our drivers can pick up their game controllers.\n\nEssentially we have a feed-forward path follower with a feed-back pure pursuit controller running on top of it:\n\nFirst, we generate a smooth path using a custom path planner. This computes smooth velocity profiles and does some basic acceleration limiting but we haven’t explored curvature related things yet.\n\nBased on the robot’s pose, we identify the closest smooth point on the path within our search window (which we prevent from ever extending backwards, effectively preventing the robot from traveling backwards along the path).\n\nBased on this closest point we grab the following information: a. Distance along the path from the start. b. Distance along the path from the end. c. The feed-forward velocity magnitude. d. The feed-forward velocity angle (for us this is essentially the pointing direction for our swerve modules). e. The robot heading goal (for us this is an independent degree of freedom).\n\nWe then identify our look-ahead point, this is where the robot should be at any given time and is used to calculate the error used by the feed-back controller. The look-ahead point is defined as either the smooth point that is the look-ahead time away from our current position, or the “chase” point, whichever is closer to us and assuming neither are behind us. Where the chase point is where the robot should currently be located along the path based completely on the feed-forward values generated by the path planner. This (a) compensates for us drifting off of the path due to imperfections in the feed-forward controller and (b) keeps us moving along the path when we stop to touch points like in the bounce path.\n\nOnce we have this look-ahead point we grab the following information: a. Distance error from the current pose to the look-ahead point. b. Pointing angle from the current pose to the look-ahead point (for us this is essentially the pointing direction for our swerve modules).\n\nNext, we have to do some conversions. The feed-forward velocity is in inches/s from the path planner and must be converted to our standardized non-dimensional drive command [0,1] based on the maximum ground velocity we can achieve. The distance error is in inches, and is “converted” into a non-dimensional drive command [0,1] by the PID controller. The independent heading error is “converted” from degrees to a non-dimensional rotation command [-1,1] by another PID controller.\n\nThe feed-forward and feed-back drive commands are broken into their vector components using the feed-forward velocity angle and the feed-back pointing angle, respectively. They are then summed and the result is field-centric X and Y drive commands.\n\nThese drive and rotation commands get passed to all of our TeleOp swerve commands. Downstream we are running in voltage compensation mode on the Falcons during auto and applying another linearizing feed-forward controller to convert the non-dimensional motor commands [-1,1] to non-dimensional motor power commands [-1,1] which scale linearly with motor RPM.\n\nOur path planner: https://github.com/secret-city-wildbots/Autonomous-Path-Planner\n\nOur robot has a shooter, intake, and climber. Our shooter uses an auto-targeting feature that enables drivers to automatically align the robot with the target and the robot will shoot when the driver holds the joystick button and the robot is ready to shoot. We also constantly track the number of balls in the robot using a beam break sensor. For easy testing and implementation of these subsystems, we developed our own test code interface, shown on our dashboard, to allow us to test each actuator individually.\n\nOur dashboard code is the primary interface with the user. To help drivers navigate the dashboard, we used three main tabs: Setup/Autonomous, TeleOp, and Tune.\n\nRather than using a joystick or physically mapped buttons, we use a touchscreen tablet for our manipulator’s controls, which appear in our TeleOp tab. The tablet expedites pre-match setup and configuration; provides continuous driver feedback with warning lights and voice commands, state indicators, and camera overlays; and enables faster UI and robot design iterations.\n\nPhysical indicators such as robot LEDs and the driver’s joystick rumble provide further feedback by showing the robot mode. We also use audible warnings with a voice we named “KAREN!” KAREN! alerts the drivers about specific sensor and swerve module failures, motor temperatures, electrical faults, pressure leaks, control latency, autonomous play typos, tablet failures, and calibration instructions.\n\nWe have also added an error map diagram overlay to display which parts of the robot have errors and a joystick command diagram overlay.\n\nOur current dashboard repo: https://github.com/secret-city-wildbots/2022-Dashboard\n\nSee link to last year’s robot reveal post: 4265 2021 Robot and Shifting Swerve Reveal\n\nOur team’s github page: https://github.com/secret-city-wildbots\n\nOur current repository for 2022: https://github.com/secret-city-wildbots/2022-Robot",

We do have to do the following analogous steps:\n\nMeasure the maximum robot acceleration and velocity.\n\nUse a simple feed forward model to get wheel velocity to scale linearly with our “power” drive commands.\n\nTune a PID controller for the swerve heading.\n\nTune a PID controller for the chase/feedback portion of our path following algorithm.",
