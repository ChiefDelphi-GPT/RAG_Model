This allowed us to make a “single click” automated pickup sequence that ensures we can pickup coral easily from any angle.

If Choreo trajectories existed between each consecutive pair of points, the code would just string them together with proper scoring actions.\n\nWith pure PID or profiled drivetrain PID we could have done the same thing, but having Choreo for straight lines was useful for library consistency and having options to adjust individual paths.",

This allowed us to make a “single click” automated pickup sequence that ensures we can pickup coral easily from any angle. With this we achieved nearly 60fps performance, even with a full FP32 model.\n\nI’ve heard of 900 and some others talking about this camera. Mind posting more details of your setup and back end?",

We buit our backend on the Stereolabs Python SDK with intrgrated visualization tools and a flask based remote viewer, we also used CuPy to enable gpu acceleration of more directly user-space tasks like our coral orientation estimation. Everything is posted to NT and read by our robot-side API.\n\nOur backend works for both the ZED 2 and X series but we use the ZED 2i for cost reason. Everything is user configurable through yaml configs.\n\nThe hardware side of this is pretty simple, just the camera connected via USB to our jetson, not much of intrest there. We run at 720p with NN assisted disparity estimation.\n\nAs far as the actual model we run, thats a YoloV8n model we run through the Stereolabs SDK intrgrated CUDNN-based inference framework.\n\nHeres our jetson-side application if your curious:\n\nGitHub - BreakerBots/ZED_FRC: ZED depth camera interface for FRC robots ZED depth camera interface for FRC robots\n\nZED depth camera interface for FRC robots",

Before, when I needed to know how to do something in whatever language or framework I was writing in (I switch around a lot), I would Google it and adapt the Stack Overflow result to my code – now I just ask Copilot and it gives me an answer which is relevant to the code that’s already in place and fits into the context nicely.

I just had to define which source to go to and which reef locations to go to, and the robot would score L4 coral there. I also had a similar system for algae autos, but we didn’t get to use it.\n\nThis was the first year we had a PhotonVision setup, and we had some suboptimal camera placements which caused issues, but it was otherwise flawless.

                    "cooked": "Personally I really liked using linear algebra for our reef alignment system. By changing the basis of the error vector (between the robot’s current position and the desired target for coral scoring) from standard (x,y) coordinates into “depth” and “lateral” coordinates (facing directly out of the AprilTag, and perpendicular to it) and running a PID controller on the depth and lateral errors, we could get the lateral movement to be faster than the depth and converge laterally first. Which means by the end of the align robot would pretty much only be moving forward.\n\nThe math isn’t that complicated but it’s great to apply some stuff we learned in math to real life!\n\nIf \\theta is the angle of the AprilTag then the “depth vector” controlling forward/backward movement would be \\vec D=\\begin{bmatrix}\\cos\\theta \\\\\\sin\\theta \\end{bmatrix} and the “lateral vector” for left/right would be \\vec L=\\begin{bmatrix}-\\sin\\theta\\\\\\cos\\theta\\end{bmatrix} so \\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{D}=0 so they are perpendicular. Then if we have the error vector E=\\begin{bmatrix}a\\\\b\\end{bmatrix} (which we obtain with [Limelight MegaTag2 estimated pose] - [desired pose]) we would need to find d,l such that d\\vec D+l\\vec L=E .\n\nWhich would be: d\\begin{bmatrix}\\cos\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta\\end{bmatrix}+l\\begin{bmatrix}-\\sin\\theta \\\\ \\cos\\theta\\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{bmatrix}\n\nWhich is equivalent to \\begin{bmatrix}\\cos\\theta & -\\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta\\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix} d \\\\ l \\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix}a \\\\ b \\end{bmatrix} .\n\nMultiplying by the inverse on the left gives \\begin{bmatrix} d \\\\ l \\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix}\\cos\\theta & -\\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta\\end{bmatrix}^{-1}\\begin{bmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{bmatrix} =\\frac{1}{\\cos^2\\theta+\\sin^2\\theta}\\begin{bmatrix}\\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ -\\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta\\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{bmatrix} =\\begin{bmatrix} a\\cos \\theta+b\\sin\\theta \\\\ -a\\sin\\theta+b\\cos\\theta \\end{bmatrix} .\n\nThen we run the PID controller on d and l individually with different K_p values.",
