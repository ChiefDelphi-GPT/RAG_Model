                    "cooked": "The feature script I have for timing belts is good for modeling a belt or chain, but I’m looking for something better for when it’s time to 3D print the belts. First, the one I have requires at least 2 pulley references and their diameters to calculate the size of the belt. I want to be able to just tell it how many teeth I want and have it generate a circular model of the belt. Does anyone have recommendations for a different tool/feature script? With that, does it really matter if the belt is printed in a circle versus in a pattern (like how it would look when installed)? The one I’ve already printed didn’t seem to hang up on any curves once it broke in, but I feel like it would make sense for it to run better if it were printed in a circle. Thanks",

Real belts undergo a lot of stress, and are typically reinforced with some kind of fiber (anything from natural fibers all the way up to steel) that makes them stronger, and keeps them from stretching.  You’re not going to get a belt that resists stretching and lasts through a competition (if at all) by 3D printing it from TPU.  It’s just not made for it, and I think you’re probably going to be disappointed in the results. It’s worth the money to buy the belts you need.  Even knockoff cheapo belts will probably perform better than 3D printed belts.  I just don’t think it’s a wise use of 3D printed materials.\n\nMaybe someone can prove me wrong, but I wouldn’t gamble on it for something so critical.",

                    "cooked": "We’re having a lot of success printing belts out of 95A TPU. Granted they are more fragile than the real things, but we understood that going in. Still, we have several on our robot and went through an entire competition with no failures other than one small nick, which we patched up with a soldering iron and a dab of epoxy during the playoffs. We print them with a thickness of 2.4 mm from root to back, which is a bit thicker than the standard profile. If you’re worried about strength, you can print your own pulleys as well and increase the width for some extra safety factor.\n\nBecause of the stretch of the TPU, we undersize the tooth count by 5% (yes, you read that right, 5 whole percent). It can make them run slightly rough on the pulleys because the belt pitch doesn’t match the pulley pitch exactly after stretching. In the future, I’d like to investigate scaling down the pitch and maintaining the tooth count instead, but it hasn’t been a priority.\n\nThe main reason we got so into printing belts was the ability to add custom features to the surface. We prototyped multiple iterations of lugs for coral conveyance before eventually using this one in our first event. We may make another revision before our next event.\n\n1000004100 1920×3413 846 KB\n\n1000004100 1920×3413 846 KB\n\n1000004100 1920×3413 846 KB\n\nNow, the dirty little secret. This part studio isn’t actually an HTD profile —we copied it from elsewhere and modified it further. It was originally based on a GT2 profile with deepened teeth. We scaled it up to 5 mm pitch to run it with HTD pulleys (we also print pulleys with deepened teeth). I would contend that if the difference between the tooth shapes, after accounting for printing tolerance, is a deal breaker for your application, it probably isn’t the right application for a printed belt.\n\nThat said, I would recommend it to anyone with a little bit of patience to dial in their prints.\n\nA few tips:\n\nTPU is stringyyyyy Dry dry dry your TPU. All the time. Lower temperatures and slower speeds can help I also have my printer set to retract the filament 1 mm, Z hop 1 mm, and to avoid crossing walls on travel, all of which seem to make a difference\n\nDry dry dry your TPU.

No idea why you’d bother to print them when you’ll spend almost as much for the TPU and get a vastly inferior product. I’d suggest looking at V-Belt Guys , who have pretty much any HTD (i.e., 5mm pitch) belt you could ask for. To find the tooth count you need, just divide the length of the belt (which is in mm) by 5. For instance, a standard 50 tooth HTD belt used in FIRST would have the part number 250-5m-09, that is 250mm long, 5mm pitch, and 9mm wide. Once you have the hang of their system, it’s easy to find them. That 50 tooth belt, by the way, is currently priced at $2.18. They ship fast and have pretty much every size you could every want, including all those odd sizes that the regular robotics suppliers don’t have.",

So hypothetically, I go to VBelt Guys and buy a belt for $3.16, then pay $40 to have it overnighted so we can try it tomorrow. That’s already the cost of an entire spool of TPU. We also have an abundance of TPU 95A available as one of our mentors has a shop that accidentally made a bulk order of it, and they use very little. Instead, I would like to print a belt in 45 minutes and have it in my hands before the end of the meeting. I understand the downsides of TPU in comparison to a proper belt, and have determined that our decision is justified and adequate. I appreciate everyone’s concerns for the longevity, it’s not a great permanent solution, but whether or not I should use TPU was not my question…",

We don’t have a great way to fixture tubing on our Shapeoko CNC, but we do have a 3D printer and drill press/cordless drills. Let’s 3D print a drill jig/guide instead that helps students put holes exactly where we want them!",

I’ll call it 30 g after purging etc. That means I can get 33 belts out of a 1 kg spool that costs $28, for a unit cost of about $0.85 (plus electricity, sure).\n\nDon’t print belts just to save money—obviously this isn’t the place to scrimp in critical applications. But on the other hand, claiming that it’s basically the same price plus extra effort for no benefit isn’t fair either.\n\nEdit: Let me make another point. How many of you have used polycord or polybelt on your robot in the past? Were you unwilling to take the risk of using such a fragile component? Or did you understand the trade-offs and make a design decision? This is the same thing, with the added improvements that printed timing belts actually have teeth instead of relying entirely on friction to transfer torque and don’t have the inbuilt weak point of a weld joint. In particular, if you could eliminate that second point, how scared would you be of using weldless polycord? How often have you broken one not at the joint, but through the bulk medium?\n\nDon’t use it to lift your elevator. Duh. But the are plenty of applications where printed belts can do just fine for you. I promise.",

We found that they got fragile the more you ran them and started to have some moving past their Yield strength, which is why you do prefer to use a normal belt to handle the stress and strain that the belts are under in the system.  3D Printed Belts = Great Prototyping but not for permanent solutions.  Until they make something like a TPU with carbon fiber embedded as continuous strand, I don’t think it will be viable.  Something like this could be done ( Buy TPU CF )  Never tried it but could be some fun off season experimenting.   It has anti-static properties as well.",
