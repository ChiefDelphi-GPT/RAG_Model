                    "cooked": "Our design this year uses Neo motors, 1:1 without a gearbox, for both our indexer and shooter mechanism. We were having some trouble designing a way to mount the motors, and may have come up with an interesting design. Can this be done and/or is this the way that this sort of thing should be done?\n\nRight now we have the motor directly screwed to our shooter side frame (maxtube). The outside part of the maxtube is drilled at .75\" to locate the small lip of the motor, keeping it centered. We then have a small .5\" 8mm keyed shaft to hex adapter keyed on the motor shaft, which is then connected with a hex coupler to the roller shaft.\n\nScreen Shot 2024-01-18 at 11.41.08 PM 683×563 97.2 KB\n\nScreen Shot 2024-01-18 at 11.41.08 PM 683×563 97.2 KB\n\nScreen Shot 2024-01-18 at 11.41.08 PM 683×563 97.2 KB\n\nI’ve seen many teams use a belt or chain in this sort of situation, so that you can have the motor not stick out ( the motor can then be mounted on the inside, next to roller) but this design seems simpler. I honestly can’t see these motors ever getting hit up on our shooter, and even if they do, they are going to be rigidly screwed on.\n\nCan anyone see any potential pitfalls/reasons this sort of mounting can’t be done?",

I wouldn’t suggest that because the vibrations and shocks that the shooter wheels and shaft experience are going to be directly transferred to the motor shaft and bearings. For example, when shooting, I assume there’s compression on the notes, so the shafts are going to be pushed outwards a bit. As a result, that could then push on the sides of the shaft and motor, leading to faster wear on the bearings. Of course, I’m a programmer and not that experienced in mechanical design, but that’s just from my experiences while prototyping and testing stuff.",

Shafts getting nudged around, issue. I’m not seeing any screw attachments of the NEO, that’s a pretty major issue–though “they’ll be rigidly screwed on” could give either issues or no issued depending on what gets bent.\n\nAnd you think the motors won’t get hit–oh, they will, trust me. Nowhere on a robot is safe.\n\nYou can get away with this for a short time. I would be highly surprised if you didn’t need to change it after your first event.\n\nWhat I would do instead is to pick any 1:1 gearbox–actually, for this, I’d probably suggest the MAX 90 for packaging reasons, or a MaxPlanetary base unit–and use that. Or possibly a 1:1 belt/chain solution. The goal is to get something into the motor’s power path to protect the motor from mechanical issues coming back and messing it up.\n\nOh, and one other issue. NEOs at 1:1 are going to be insanely fast, even for a shooter. Please check once you build it to make sure it doesn’t make Note Powder.",

Maybe not as fast as a 775Pro at top speed… but let’s see just how fast you can expect stuff to come out of the shooter shown.\n\nLooks like 4\" wheels, 1:1 drive from the motor so the wheel is spinning at 5500 RPM (easier calculation plus allowance for load). C=pi()*D. Wheels spin at 69,000 in/min linear speed, translates to 96 ft/second exit velocity for the Note if it leaves at the same speed the wheels are spinning.\n\nThat’s 1 second of flight time to cross two FRC fields end-to-end, almost. This is generally considered pretty stinkin’ fast –if this were something heavier, it would probably be considered for “are we sure this is safe?” treatment by officials.",

We’re definitely going to rigorously test our final shooter, see what RPM works best, and probably even add a 1:3 module into the gearbox to give us a little more torque, as we won’t need all the speed.\n\nThanks for all the feedback!

Because of the inherit motor limitations (specifically low to zero output torque at high speed) as well as shots wasting a lot of energy due to it acting like a collision and because of friction, shots are physically unable to exit anywhere near your shooter’s free speed. Gearing the motor 3:1 down just runs into the exact problem but at lower shooter rpms and you will will run into the exact same issues but now you are doing so at lower velocity. For long range shots, you will need most of the speed of a 1:1 shooter because of these limitations\n\nTeam_555:\n\nchain forward\n\nChains don’t particularly like spinning at high RPMs, belts would be a much better option here",

Putting a 3:1 triples the available torque.\n\n3 times zero is still zero, motors output progressively less torque as RPM increases and zero torque at their free speeds. You want the shot/recovery to occur well below the free speed so the motor actually outputs anything, with free speed shots being impossible\n\nEricH:\n\n(Also, I remind you about momentum in shooter wheels.)\n\nFlywheels with extra mass take several seconds to reach their free speed which is way too slow, and ilding the shooter at a lower rpm isn’t gonna help you as most of the spinup time would be spend near but not at the free speed.

The 4\" wheels are a lot more than the Kitbot is slinging, so I’d probably focus my design efforts there on adding a gear/chain/belt stage.  (Bonus for chain: you get a free flywheel!).\n\nEdit: Here’s an extra photo or two from the camera roll, showing what we had going on.\n\nIMG_3371 1920×2560 251 KB IMG_3372 1920×2560 317 KB\n\nIMG_3371 1920×2560 251 KB\n\nIMG_3371 1920×2560 251 KB\n\nIMG_3372 1920×2560 317 KB\n\nIMG_3372 1920×2560 317 KB\n\n(We made a tactical error; we were using the 5/16\" tapped plugs for these rollers, but our rails got made with 1.125\" OD bearing bores not 7/8\" ones.

And while the 96fps isn’t going to likely happen it does bring up some worries if you get to around half that. Maybe not insane worries (but concerns for individuals not paying attention or at close range, equipment on the scoring table, etc) 60fps is about 40 miles a hour, not too bad and plenty of time to react unless you are at point blank (warning pit crew!)\n\nMore to the point: Concerns around motor shaft axial loads/vibrations and concentricity are very well founded and detailed in this thread. Lots of FRC knowledge floating around. It is fun to stir the pot an see what you can get away with sometimes. I don’t think this is something you can get away with on a comp bot in the usecase mentioned. Prototyping? Sure. Comp? Probably not for too long.",

                    "cooked": "Regarding the shooter wheel velocity vs. note exit speed, we did some limit testing with a pair of Cims and 4 inch wheels.   We found basically no difference in note exit velocity between a roughly 1:1 drive ratio (~5000 rpm, 85 fps wheel speed) and a maxed out 2.5:1 speed ratio (estimated 8000-10,000 rpm after the motors wound up for 10 seconds, 140 fps wheel speed).  When calculating the velocity via ballistics equations, the note maxed out at 40-50 fps in that test shooter.\n\nWhat I believe this shows is that the note is initially engaging the spinning wheels with kinetic / sliding friction, and if the wheels are spinning fast enough the note will not have time to “catch up” to the wheel surface and grip with static friction before it is ejected.  The faster wheel speed only results in more slippage between the note and the wheel, and more orange flakes as a result.\n\nThis still leaves room for secondary improvements to increase friction with the note, such as wheel selection and note compression, as well as mulitple wheel stages to progressively increase the note speed.  How much speed is needed is a sepatate question, of course.",
