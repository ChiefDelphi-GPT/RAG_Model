It runs under 23.whatever just fine but on the 24.3.2  it brings up the control panel for the Romi and there is nothing in the  Other devices panel which shows the Romi gyro on the 23 version.  The joystick works fine which you would expect since it is a local device to the PC.\n\nI see a new thing on the Robot Stat that says Disconnected which is new but clicking on any of the other options doesn’t let you drive the Romi.\n\nOn the VS log section I get the following\n\nError at edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.MotorSafety.check(MotorSafety.java:140): DifferentialDrive… Output not updated often enough. See Using the WPILib Classes to Drive your Robot — FIRST Robotics Competition documentation for more information. repeated over and over again\n\nThey just keep on coming.  It appears that there is no communications between the Romi and the Sim on the PC.\n\nDo I need to update the Romi so it works with the 24.3.2?  I saw something posted in one of my searches showing it was for Vision processing.  I hesitate to load it until I’m sure.\n\nI probably missed something somewhere that would tell me but I seemed to be doing a circular search and times and thought I’d ask here.\n\nAny help appreciated.",

That should work (without updating the Romi).\n\nDid you change the Romi network settings when setting it up?  E.g. is it running as an AP, or is it connecting to a local WiFi network in bridge mode?  There are some network settings that are stored at the project level in build.gradle, so if you created a new 2024 project, they wouldn’t have gotten transferred over.  See this section of the docs for customizing the IP address of the Romi: Programming the Romi — FIRST Robotics Competition documentation If you look in your 2023 project, if that’s set there, you can copy it over and see if that fixes things.",

I connect to the Romi just as if it were a router (which I guess you are referring to as an Access Point)  I assume it is the 2023.2.1 image but don’t remember which one I installed.  It works with 2023 First Romi programs in any case.  The driver console does show connecting to 10.0.0.2 with 2 ports so they seem to be talking at least some.\n\nI’m thinking I might just try creating a new image for the Pi on the Romi and see if that helps.  I’m assuming you can re-image the Pi over and over and it will treat the Romi correctly.   I just don’t know why the current version on the Romi won’t work with 24.x  but does with 23.x unless it’s an earlier version than the 2023.2.1 image.\n\nI’ll try this tomorrow since I think I’m going to be snowed in anyhow.\n\nThanks for your help",
