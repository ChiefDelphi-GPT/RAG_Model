                    "cooked": "For my senior project I’m working on an autonomous robotic sailboat. Our sailboat uses a rigid self trimming wingsail. One of the potential things we’ve been discussing is adding a dampener to the mast, and another potential thing we’re looking at is the ability to essentially ‘brake’ the sail in one place when necessary.\n\nI’m looking into potentially using a Falcon 500 for this purpose, as the robotics department already has some laying around, with an algorithm to apply some amount of force in the opposite direction depending on wind speed. We could also engage brake mode if we wanted to keep the mast stationary for certain maneuvers. And as a bonus, the built in encoder would be able to add positional feedback to the mast which is something we want to add anyways. That said, I have some conceptual questions I would appreciate if someone could help guide me through, or direct me to resources about.\n\nThe big thing is power: My main inspiration for this system is how regenerative braking works in EVs. Where it essentially ‘backdrives’ the motor in order to slow down the vehicle. Doing this also generates power and sends it back to the battery. If I’m trying to resist the natural motion of the sail, would it be consuming power to fight against it, or capturing it in the vein of regenerative braking? If it’s capturing it, where would that power go? Stay in the motor? Back to the battery? If it’s generating it, does anyone have any suggestions for good resources to calculate how much energy it would use over time?\n\nI’m working on analyzing the forces involved with the sail at different wind speeds, as well as the level of dampening we might want. I have the JVN calculator which is always a great resource, but I also will not say no to more resources. If the Falcon is a bad fit, I am also totally open to other suggestions for motors that would work! Though at this point it’s less about the specific motor and more about shoring up my conceptual understanding of the system and if it’s even viable.",

EDIT: it’ll regen! Cool! (See below from b-hall)\n\nIn the case of reactive Regen Braking you’ll generate back-emf and push energy back into the battery. In the case of fighting a setpoint, it’ll stall, pull a bunch of current, and dissipate a bunch of heat.\n\nNegligible amounts, KE is small, 1/2 I (omega) ^2\n\nBriFRC:\n\nWe could also engage brake mode if we wanted to keep the mast stationary for certain maneuvers\n\nDepending on the scale of the vessel, brake mode is extremely unlikely to halt motion of the mast. Active position control is more likely what you’d need to implement, if you’re trying to fight the self-trimming wingsail.\n\nTL;DR - don’t expect regenerative braking, it’ll damp fine in brakemode, but the scale of damping is unlikely to be as significant as you’re hoping.

There’s supposed to be a explanation of BLDC regen braking above this….\n\n”Regen braking” involves taking back-EMF generated by spinning the motorshaft from the external load, and feeding the back-EMF to the battery. That’s stupid easy on a brushed DC motor onto a DC bus, because spinning the shaft makes DC happen mechanically. Connect the H-bridges in the controller and now the battery gets fed by the DC.\n\nBLDC is most commonly a 3 multi-pole system at the motor, so spinning the motor shaft won’t automatically give you DC - it needs to be rectified by the controller timing against the encoder position. This doesn’t matter in FRC , so I doubt CTRE has a firmware that does this. I tagged Daltz to see if he knew about non- FRC firmwares that might implement something like that. EDIT: CTRE does this, neat!",

Student Work | SailBot 2024-25 | ID: kd17cz447 | Digital WPI\n\nThey were looking at a liquid dampener, but I’m not sure if that’s the best solution, because we would want variable dampening based on wind speed, which is why a motor is potentially appealing. Though I’m potentially concerned about power draw, as the endurance challenge has us out there for 8 hours without coming back to dock. The sail also managed to get stuck into irons a few times during last years competition, so being able to nudge the sail out of that configuration could be good. But we’re still very much in the early phases of this, so I’m trying to balance a lot of factors while learning more about the bot in general.",

They will know more than people on CD .\n\nBriFRC:\n\nWe could also engage brake mode if we wanted to keep the mast stationary for certain maneuvers.\n\nBrake mode doesn’t hold the motor stationary, it just shorts the motor such that the produced back-emf opposes motion of the shaft. You will need some sort of feedback controller to prevent all movement which will consume additional power.\n\nBriFRC:\n\nThe big thing is power: My main inspiration for this system is how regenerative braking works in EVs. Where it essentially ‘backdrives’ the motor in order to slow down the vehicle. Doing this also generates power and sends it back to the battery. If I’m trying to resist the natural motion of the sail, would it be consuming power to fight against it, or capturing it in the vein of regenerative braking? If it’s capturing it, where would that power go? Stay in the motor? Back to the battery?\n\nIf you want any behavior other than brake mode, consuming, even if we pretend the motor controller doesn’t have idle draw. But you will have some regen. The regen will cause voltage to appear across the leads, and how bad this is depends on your setupp. In some setups, the battery can cope with the regen, but in others, it will trip power supplies or damage electronics. You will likely have to look at the spec sheets of the rest of your setup to know if they can tolerate regen. If backdriving is problematic, you can use a regen clamp to dissipate the back-emf.\n\nBriFRC:\n\nIf it’s generating it, does anyone have any suggestions for good resources to calculate how much energy it would use over time?\n\nIt depends heavily on the operating conditions and what control method and tuning you are using. If you know both of those, its easy enough to solve by creating a dynamic sim using the 1-phase model for the motor, but this feels like the type of problem where you can’t really know the operating conditions well at all.",

However, you’re only going to see substantial supply current regenerated when braking at a high velocity—a higher back emf corresponds to a higher duty cycle to honor the stator current limit, and supply current is stator current times duty cycle. That happens frequently in FRC (every time you brake your swerve drive), but it may not in this scenario.\n\nAdditionally, regen braking damps motion, decreasing velocity, but it cannot hold position. That requires motor output that consumes power rather than regenerating it.",

If you wanted to be more clever you could also do some things with a centrifical clutch to engage more flywheel mass the faster is spun, or otherwise alter the flywheel MOI (old school goveners on steam engines for example, fighting gravity) there is a ton you could do.\n\nHowever the mechanical complexity balloons quickly vs an adjustable damper that is just linear servo and two closely fitting tubes with grease.",

This isn’t something I’ve heard of, but considering what I know about our electrical system and current lack of BMS, having a way to address the regen if we go this route will very likely be necessary.\n\nActive device that will engage a high-power resistor when back-emf is generated.\n\nBriFRC:\n\nThank you. Does the motor itself have the ability to store some of that regen? Or is it dumped back into the battery/processor that’s the motor is connected to? I’m trying to figure out the types of electrical protections we would need if we decided on an application that would involve some amount of regen.\n\nMotor controllers will have a small amount of capacitance, but a vast majority of the power is dumped into the leads and whatever they are attached to.\n\nAdditionally, how tolerant is your system to hysteresis? There are easily-adjustable linear dampers (think horizontal bandsaw), but they often have significant hysteresis due to not having a constant volume and therefore having some air in the system.",

If you need to hold position, then you need to run position PID instead, which means that once you’re no longer decelerating from a high velocity, you are consuming power to drive to position using PID .",

You have finely powdered magnetic material and parts that can move through it.  No field it looks like a low loss liquid.  Add some magnetic field and you get a continuously variable damping, all the way to “doesn’t turn”.  This won’t give you regeneration capability, though.\n\nIf you want to pull more energy, you might gear up a brushless motor (like a NEO) and then use an active three phase rectifier/boost converter on it.  You treat the motor coils kind of like the inductors in a boost converter; this will let you pull more current out than you would with simpler electronics.  BUT, complicated design time needed….\n\nA magnetic particle clutch is a special type of electromagnetic clutch which does not use friction plates. Instead, it uses a fine powder of magnetically susceptible material (typically stainless steel) to mechanically link an otherwise free-wheeling disc attached to one shaft, to a rotor attached to the other shaft.\n This clutch is a form of a powder clutch. Torque is transmitted mechanically, through a metal powder filling. In the magnetically controlled version, an applied magnetic field is us...",
