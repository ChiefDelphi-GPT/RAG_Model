                    "cooked": "Greetings great gurus of Chief Delphi,\n\nHere is another question from a rookie Mentor. I was wondering if most programmers/drivers let their shooter’s flywheel run continuously during an entire match or do they program it so that it only speeds when the driver is ready to shoot? For the ones who might ask, our shooting mechanism is fairly basic. It consists of two  Colson wheels spun by a mini-Cim directly connected to the hex shaft. We have also included a through-the-bore CTRE mag encoder to get the RPM but nothing has been programmed yet. The system does not include a separate inertia wheel. So far, we have made some shooting tests where we would shoot just outside the tarmac and it takes about 3 to 4 secs for the motor to rev up to speed so we can hit the high goal. So, my concern is should we just let the motor spin constantly in order to prevent from having to wait for it to get up to the desired speed between cycles. Moreover, if we do let the motor spin continuously ( we would obviously slow it down) wouldn’t it drain the battery quite substantially?\n\nAny advice or recommendation would be appreciated\n\nBest,",

On the other hand, starting and stopping the motors resulted in them getting quite warm. So we added a timer to leave the spinner runnig for a few seconds after the last shot in case another shot follows soon. Next was ramping them up to speed slowly (~3 seconds) to reduce the current spikes and heatup, which then meant we needed a button for the driver to “pre-spinup” ahead of a shot to reduce the time for shooting. Bottom line, simply leaving them running all the time, maybe at a slightly reduced speed, seems simplest and most gentle on the motors and battery.",

On a good battery he is able to go through over 6 minutes of constant runtime with the shooter, drivetrain, and constant intaking and indexing going on.\n\nEdit: I should’ve mentioned we are using 2 NEOs in a 1:1 configuration with our average shot being around 2750rpms.",

Running 2 falcons which a slight belt reduction (we are running 21:15) will allow the shooter wheels to spin up to speed in fractions of a second. Do make sure to correctly tune your velocity PIDs as an incorrectly tuned one can either spin up slowly or behave erratically.",

As you’re driving to your shooting position, your driver can press the button to start spinning up your shooter. It should be ready within a few seconds, right as you’re done aligning with the target. This will save on battery charge and keep the motor from overheating.",
