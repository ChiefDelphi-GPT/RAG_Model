                    "cooked": "Hello, We are considering adding a CNC Break to our toolset. We use 0.125 aluminum in our designs and typically order sheet metal from FabWorks.  The prices from FW are not bad, but the time-to-delivery is often 7+ days for us, making it prohibitive. My goals are several-fold:\n\nIntroduce students to metal bending and how to design for it\n\nShorten turn-time so that we use sheetmetal more often\n\nExpand our use of sheetmetal, since I view is a core capability\n\nReduce mass for on robot mechanisms.\n\nWe tend to use a lot of tube-stock in our robot designs, since it gives us easy 90-degree surfaces.  And it is a powerful technique, but I think sheet metal can be lighter, allow more design freedom and might be simpler. I havent used a cnc-break, so I’ll need to learn it, but that will just take some time and practice.\n\nAfter champs this year, we visited Robonauts (What a shop!) and saw their Langmuir Titan 25T CNC Break.  It looks like we can get one with a reasonable set of tooling/fixtures for about $9K.\n\nQuestions:\n\nHow valuable is break for FRC design?\n\nCan you recommend a good break for 1/8\" aluminum?\n\nDoes anyone have the Titan 25T and, if so, do you recommend it?\n\nThank you.

To curb expectations it’s not as good as a Trumpf or Amada or even the higher end Chinese brake presses but it def does the job.\n\nWe bent all the 1323 parts in house this year and enjoyed the option to bend random stuff.  I was a huge fan of this video growing up (man it’s 15 years old……) and its nice that we can finally do sheet metal parts in house.",

                    "cooked": "I do agree with this but the price gap between a decent manual brake and the Langmuir CNC sheet metal brake isn’t as big as it used to be.\n\nWe have had this Baileigh manual brake for years and it has been great but takes a lot of test bends and quite a bit of time to dial in bends. It costs $4,200.\n\nWe got the Langmuir Titan 25T in February when we lost access to NASA sheet metal bending. We ordered all of the accessories and all of the tooling available for just under $10,000 (Prices have gone up a bit since then). Many of the dies aren’t necessary for bending FRC material thicknesses and the material support arms aren’t needed either. Much of our tooling was backordered so we had to get by with what punches and dies were in stock when we ordered and we ended up cutting some dies to fit our needs.\n\nAlmost all of our parts on this years 118 and 10118 robots were bent on the Langmuir except for a few that were bent on @Ethan_Reed ’s Atek Bantam CNC Pneumatic press brake.\n\nThe Langmuir is absolutely amazing for the price. It is not as repeatable as industry leaders such as Amada (What NASA RAP used) or Trumpf Trubend. It also requires more test bends to get accurate parts that you just don’t have to do on an industrial machine, however a fully loaded Titan costs 15 times less than the cheapest Amada 4010 machine without any tooling, so its incredible value.\n\nI will add that it is clear that the Langmuir is a hobbyist machine, it runs off of an Orange Pi and when we got ours its SD card was corrupted out of the box and needed to be replaced. This was simple to do ourselves but was an annoyance. The CNC back gauge assembly is insanely tedious and took one person over 20 hours to put together. Their process in the manual for squaring the two back gauge axis doesn’t make any sense and we used our own process to ensure the machine was square. I want to emphasize that your bend quality heavily depends on how much effort you put into ensuring the back gauge is square and that everything is tight.\n\nLangmuir has good punch and die guides on their forums here.\n\nIf you are trying to outfit a Langmuir for FRC use I would purchase the following:\n\nLangmuir Titan 25T Machine - $4,495\n\nLangmuir CNC Back gauge - $1,249\n\nIndustrial Stand and Tool Storage Tray - $495\n\nLifting Brackets - $30 (you can get away without them if you are crafty with lifting straps)\n\n120V Transformer if you don’t have 220V power in your shop - $120\n\nThe punches and dies listed below that fit the thicknesses of material you want to bend.\n\nQTY 16: 5/16-18 Lever Bolts from McMaster - $11 (These make swapping punches and dies so much easier than using an allen wrench to tighten the bolts that come in the machine.)\n\nLangmuir Lever Bolts 1865×1398 429 KB\n\nLangmuir Lever Bolts 1865×1398 429 KB\n\nLangmuir Lever Bolts 1865×1398 429 KB\n\nMany people refer to all of the tooling in a press brake as “dies,” technically the tool that goes in the top of the machine is called the punch and the tool that goes in the bottom is called the die. Another misconception is that the tip radius of the punch determines the final bend radius of the part, while it does influence the bend radius the size of the die also plays a large part in the bend radius of your part coming out of the machine. A bottom die with a larger opening will lead to a larger bend radius. Langmuir’s 35° punches have a tip radius of 3mm and all their other punches have a tip radius of 1mm.\n\nYour punch needs to have the right geometry such that your part does not crash into it when bending. The standard punches will let you do most of the simple bends you would like to do but anytime you need to bend any deep C-channels or complicated geometry gooseneck dies are often needed.\n\nThe following punches will let you do traditional bends on parts that don’t have a depth to width ratio greater than ~1.5. You can go for the 30 degree punches that will allow for tighter bends however they are not as stiff and therefore the bends won’t be as repeatable, especially in thicker material.\n\nQTY 1: 35° Punch 16\" Wide - $180\n\nQTY 1: 35° Punch 8\" Wide - $95\n\nQTY 1: 35° Punch 4\" Wide - $50\n\nQTY 2: 35° Punch 2\" Wide - $35\n\nQTY 1: 35° Punch 1\" Wide - $25\n\nThe below punches will let you do most of the other deep bends that are possible with traditional bending methods. The Extreme Gooseneck punches will give you more options for bending weird parts but are quite expensive and will flex more when bending thicker materials.\n\n85° Extreme Gooseneck Punches\n\nQTY 1: 85° Extreme Gooseneck Punch 16\" Wide - $370\n\nQTY 1: 85° Extreme Gooseneck Punch 8\" Wide - $185\n\nQTY 1: 85° Extreme Gooseneck Punch 4\" Wide - $95\n\nQTY 2: 85° Extreme Gooseneck Punch 2\" Wide - $60\n\nQTY 1: 85° Extreme Gooseneck Punch 1\" Wide - $35\n\n88° Gooseneck Punches\n\nQTY 1: 88° Gooseneck Punch 16\" Wide - $165\n\nQTY 1: 88° Gooseneck Punch 8\" Wide - $85\n\nQTY 1: 88° Gooseneck Punch 4\" Wide - $45\n\nQTY 2: 88° Gooseneck Punch 2\" Wide - $30\n\nQTY 1: 88° Gooseneck Punch 1\" Wide - $20\n\nFor dies the general rule of thumb is that the die opening needs to be 8x the material thickness you are wanting to bend. This can be pushed a little bit if you only have tighter dies on hand but the accuracy of your bends will be affected. The width of the die opening also determines how short of a flange you can bend. In general the flange length should be a little more than 1/2 of the width of the die opening. For example you can bend a .040\" thick part on the 25mm dies listed below but the flange length must be at least 1/2\" long whereas if you bent it using the 8mm dies you could have a flange as short as 3/16\"\n\nThe following dies will let you bend up to .040\" thick material . If this is all you have you can push it to bend 1/16\" material but it will likely get the part stuck in the die and you will end up with a tighter bend radius than you would with the next size up die.\n\nQTY 1: Acute 8mm Die 16\" Wide - $160\n\nQTY 1: Acute 8mm Die 8\" Wide - $85\n\nQTY 1: Acute 8mm Die 4\" Wide - $45\n\nQTY 2: Acute 8mm Die 2\" Wide - $30\n\nQTY 1: Acute 8mm Die 1\" Wide - $20\n\nThe following dies will let you bend up to .080\" thickness material. You can get away with .090\" thick material and these are the dies we used for bending .090\" parts.\n\nQTY 1: Acute 16mm Die 16\" Wide - $190\n\nQTY 1: Acute 16mm Die 8\" Wide - $95\n\nQTY 1: Acute 16mm Die 4\" Wide - $55\n\nQTY 2: Acute 16mm Die 2\" Wide - $35\n\nQTY 1: Acute 16mm Die 1\" Wide - $25\n\nThe following dies will let you bend material up to 1/8\" thick.\n\nQTY 1: Acute 25mm Die 16\" Wide - $200 QTY 1: Acute 25mm Die 8\" Wide - $105 QTY 1: Acute 25mm Die 4\" Wide - $55 QTY 2: Acute 25mm Die 2\" Wide- $35 QTY 1: Acute 25mm Die 1\" Wide - $25\n\nIf you need to save a bit of money you could purchase the 4 way die which gives you 4 different die openings (16mm, 22mm, 35mm, and 50mm) I do not like using the 4 way dies as you can’t clamp them into the machine using the threaded holes which leads to less repeatability than bottom dies that are actually clamped in. For most FRC parts however you likely won’t notice the error. You also can’t do acute bends with the 4-way die as its die opening is 85° which is meant for 90° bends.\n\nIf you want to buy the 4 way dies I recommend the following:\n\nQTY 1: 4-way Die 16\" Wide - $190\n\nQTY 1: 4-way Die 8\" Wide - $100\n\nQTY 1: 4-way Die 4\" Wide - $55\n\nQTY 2: 4-way Die 2\" Wide - $45\n\nQTY 1: 4-way Die 1\" Wide - $25\n\nQTY 6: 4-way Die Holder - $50\n\nThis isn’t going to be a super in depth tutorial for designing for sheet metal as this post is already quite long but I want to link a few resources.\n\nIn 2023 I presented a sheet metal design presentation at the FIRST Mentor Conference, unfortunately the recording of my presentation was corrupted. I may present an updated version of this presentation with more info about the Langmuir Titan and Fabworks integrated into it this year. The slides themselves are missing a lot of context that came from the in person presentation but they still may be useful to some.\n\nThe slides for this presentation can be found here.\n\nFabworks has some great design recommendations here. I have had great experiences with Fabworks and have sent them parts for the Robonauts and many complicated parts for NASA that turned out phenomenal. Many of the white sheet metal parts on the top of the LTV GTU rover that you may have seen at Champs were made by Fabworks. LTV-GTU 1588×1271 275 KB\n\nLTV-GTU 1588×1271 275 KB\n\nLTV-GTU 1588×1271 275 KB\n\nOshcut has a great feature on their site where it will animate the bend order for any part you upload and show you if it is possible to bend and where the problem areas are if it can’t be bent. This can save you so much time if you run every part you design into their site before you manufacture it to catch and issues and have a good idea of your bend order before getting to the machine. Here is an example of this animation on a part for our 2025 robot.",

To curb expectations it’s not as good as a Trumpf or Amada or even the higher end Chinese brake presses but it def does the job.\n\nHelped RC tool this one out and I gotta say I was really impressed by the specs and the parts they made on this, crazy you get get anywhere in the ballpark of what we can do for 1/50th the cost of our Trumpf TruBend…\n\nIf any FRC teams end up getting a titan25t or similar cnc brake, please please please take it very seriously. These machines are an order of magnitude easier to hurt yourself on than other equipment most have in an FRC shop. These entry level machines are missing tons of safety features that our industrial brakes have.  Our press brakes are the only piece of equipment that I dont feel comfortable with our kids running, as brakes take a certain amount of finesse to operate safely .",

It costs $4,200.\n\nWe got the Langmuir Titan 25T in February when we lost access to NASA sheet metal bending. We ordered all of the accessories and all of the tooling available for just under $10,000 (Prices have gone up a bit since then).\n\nmore than double the price? and thats a manual brake that has all the fancy bits. while this may be smaller than it used to be, its still an enormous gap for most teams.",

It’s really just a pain to use.\n\nFor bending 3/16\" polycarbonate yes it will crack if bent directly on that manual brake, mostly due to the sharp radius on the dies. Here is a photo of a cracked 3/16\" polycarbonate part. Cracked_3_16_Polycarb_Sheet 1279×959 138 KB\n\nCracked_3_16_Polycarb_Sheet 1279×959 138 KB\n\nCracked_3_16_Polycarb_Sheet 1279×959 138 KB\n\nThe method we developed to bend parts with a larger radius on that manual brake without cracking the material was to put sacrificial sheets on top of the part that also get bent with the main part and therefor increase  the bend radius. We also lower the bottom die and fill in the gap with sheet material as well. Here are a couple photos showing that process on an 1/8\" aluminum part.\n\n125_aluminum_with_top_shim 1279×959 237 KB 125_sheet_Bending 1279×959 186 KB 125_Sheet_Final_Bend 1279×959 199 KB\n\n125_aluminum_with_top_shim 1279×959 237 KB\n\n125_aluminum_with_top_shim 1279×959 237 KB\n\n125_sheet_Bending 1279×959 186 KB\n\n125_sheet_Bending 1279×959 186 KB\n\n125_Sheet_Final_Bend 1279×959 199 KB\n\n125_Sheet_Final_Bend 1279×959 199 KB\n\nObviously this process is more work and requires more experience to get quality parts than just using a CNC brake like the Langmuir, but it is still possible to get good parts like this.\n\nThe primary intake structure on our 2023 robot was made from 3/16\" polycarbonate and bent using this process.

It’s generally recommended to bend cold at 90° or less and bend 20-40° past the desired final bend angle to account for spring back. Cold bending >90° may exceed the elastic limit and preheating the bend line can prevent that. Increasing the bend radius will also reduce the risk of cracking.",
