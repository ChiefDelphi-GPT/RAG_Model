                    "cooked": "My team has been having an issue with our connection to the RoboRIO and the code lately. Every time we deploy or restart code, the Driverstation loses connection on the left hand side (ie. two of the three bars on the left-hand side go red indicating no COMMS), but on the right it usually fluctuates between something like ‘Ping-results: link-bad, DS -radio (good), Robot Radio (Good), Roborio (Good), FMS -bad’ and ‘Ping-results: link-bad, DS -radio (good), Robot Radio (Good), Roborio (Bad), FMS -bad’ at a slow rate. I do not have the exact error messages right now as I am away from the drive station, but I will upload screenshots of the messages when I can.\n\nWe have tried changing out both Access Point radio and Robot radio (all of which are at the latest firmware version), as well as switching the roborio (without reimaging; moving the SD card). We have changed our own IP assignment on the DS to static at 10.1.72.5 from DHCP at 10.1.72.20.\n\nHowever, as one of our mentors works with networking frequently, we did try running some debugging tools for networking on the roboRIO. We noticed that before restarting the code or deploying, we could ssh in easily and run a few commands. Notably we ran ‘top’ and ‘netstat -ant’. These did not show anything unusual with exactly how many networking connections as we believed there should be and the statistics in top were normal. However, after deploying, we were able to ssh back in (although the ssh took about 1 whole minute just to log in), and run top. This time the load average was ~30 (compared to ~4 from before). Furthermore, we noticed a lot of (we are believing defunct) sshd instances. Netstat revealed at least 8-10 different ssh connections that all seemed to be in a waiting state. We are unsure about whether this is our code causing this issue or a configuration, but we are pretty sure it has something to do with these SSH spikes.\n\nFor a timeline, we noticed this issue a few weeks ago, but it was very intermittent, only every tenth deploy or so. However, this has gotten worse over time, and now every single deploy or robot code restart triggers the issue. We are planning on trying a basic repository to see if its our code, and also try to log various networking and linux messages to a file via a script.\n\nHere is a link to our code, and thank you in advance for your time and help.",

Therefore, the other programmers and I looked at each other and decided to redo the entire codebase rather than keep debugging this issue. We successfully redid all of our code at this link in a much smaller, simpler format. After as DCMPs is over, I do plan on going back to the old code and trying to figure out what exactly went wrong, and I will try connecting via ethernet. I will post more then.
