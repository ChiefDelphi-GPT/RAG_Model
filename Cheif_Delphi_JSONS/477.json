You dont want wires to be pulled super tightly especially if youre using zip ties or other cable management tools to route your electrical lines.  You’ll also want some slack in the event things need to change or if you end up needing to re do connectors or strip wires again for any reason.  im not saying to leave a loop or bundle, but a little extra is nice.\n\nThink logically about routing wires, you dont want a gigantic bundle of random cables that will be hard to sort through when troubleshooting. Be deliberate ie. bundle the motors for one swere module together in its own line, keep an individual subsystem grouped, keep CAN organized with its location or subsystem, etc.\n\nbasically a little forethought and organization goes a long way to making electrical clean and serviceable in a pinch.  there are obviously things you could do outside of this that are more advanced but these are usually the first things i teach students interested in doing the electrical work.",

If so, work closely with them.\n\nTug test everything! Practice wire stripping and crimping. Try not to bundle power cables with communication cables. Look here on CD for wiring diagrams that someone did a few months ago.  Very helpful. Download/view all the documentation for all electronic components that you will use on your robot.  We started a binder this year to keep it all handy. Think about and organize your wire runs before running them. Read the game manual for details about minimum wire gauges for components and where to connect them. Those should get you started!\n\nHere is the thread for the updated control system diagrams.

We zip-tied most of our power wire sets together because we wanted to stay organized and have all of our wires in one general area. This backfired on us when we needed to trace a specific wire set back to the PDH , and some wire sets got extremely hard to follow through a wire highway. Since you seem like you are talking from experience, how do you bundle the wires for each motor/motor set individually without losing organization? Also, do you have a picture of your robot’s wiring that I could take inspiration from?",

                    "cooked": "Do a tug-test on each and every individual wire immediately after making each and every connection (screw terminal, push button terminal, lever nut, solder joint, etc.). Tug-test each wire in a pair separately because if one of a pair is secure and the second is not, the pair may appear to be secure.\n\nRead the documentation for all the control system components to find the strip-lengths for all the connectors used.\n\nWork out the routing of wires (bundles) by taking screenshots of the 3D CAD from various viewpoints then drawing in the wires (bundles) using the drawing tool. Use different colors for the high-current wires, low-current wires, and signal wires.\n\nWhen securing the wire bundles, do not tighten the zipties too much. It should be possible for the wires to shift a little when pulled. It becomes impossible to trace wires when the zipties are too tight.\n\nTreat the control system as one of the subsystems in the robot. Reserve space for it in the early stages of the detailed design of the robot and firmly enforce it. Ensure that there is adequate access to the battery, main breaker, radio, and other control system parts for construction, repair and troubleshooting. Someone from the electrical group should be frequently reviewing the CAD design of the robot to ensure that access is not blocked and that the placement of the electrical components makes sense.\n\nThe larger the wires, the more priority should be put into reducing their length. Thus, the highest priority should be put on reducing the length of the wires from the battery SB-50 connector to the main breaker to the PDH / PDP and back to the SB-50.\n\nDesign the control system parts to be installed on sub-panels that can be built up in parallel with the assembly work of the robot chassis. It may even be possible to do some basic pre-tests on the control system before the sub-panels are installed in the robot.\n\nUse other forms of training, such as mechanical, to select people who demonstrate good attention to detail and good workmanship to be trained to do the electrical construction. It will be much easier to get a good, reliable control system. With previous teams, I would personally check the control system before the first competition. Typically, there would be 1/4 to 1/3 of the connections would have to be redone. Using this method of choosing members of the electrical team, I have not inspected the control system for the last 3 seasons and we have not experienced any workmanship related failures in the control system.",

Hot glue is good and you should use it to help strain relief connectors, etc, but make sure not to overdo it and bring 99% iso alcohol to remove it if need be ( these tiny bottles are great for that ) If you are using powerpoles make sure anyone who crimps them is very experienced in how to do it well, since its not as easy to tell if a bad crimp is causing issues visually compared to something like wagos (easier visual inspection is why we switched to wagos, but I don’t really think they are better, go with what you know). On that thought always strip enough when using wagos, its marked on them.\n\nFor can: solder or molex sl, Molex sl has been working great for us if you want a hotswappable connector like that.\n\nIf you use spark maxes for the love of god don’t use the double crimped rev jst connectors. Just crimp your own or order thriftybot ones.",

Normally this would be labeled in robot, but this was done in such a rush we didnt have time to place that in this season (wiring was completed like 3 days prior to our first regional.  We also run a stacked electronics board which can definitely introduce some headache, running cable in a logical manner keeps it from being too bad for maintenance.

The wire in the foreground is one of the previously mentioned pivot motor runs but is packaged separately from the module for easy troubleshooting.\n\nHonestly, this isnt the cleanest set of cable runs for us, but its definitely better than a birds nest and allows us to quickly troubleshoot electrical issues on the fly. its just unfortunate i cant lift the stack to show the underside wire runs without removing the entire elevator assembly.\n\nEDIT: bonus as to what our electrical lookes like 3 seasons ago before i started overseeing it more closely as the lead mentor.\n\n20250501_145708 1920×2560 480 KB\n\n20250501_145708 1920×2560 480 KB\n\n20250501_145708 1920×2560 480 KB",

We supervise the first few crimps for any connector, and if they meet spec, we keep one as a reference. If a crimp is poor, we provide direct feedback for correction. Every connection gets a few sharp tugs to ensure it’s properly seated and clipped in. For PowerPole connectors, we add a zip tie once they’re fully landed to keep them secure.\n\nInspect and Test Crimps Visually inspect each crimp and perform a pull test.

Soldered wires become brittle at the solder-to-copper transition—often under insulation—making breaks harder to diagnose.
