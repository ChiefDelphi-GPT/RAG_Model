                    "cooked": "Hi CD\n\nI hope you are enjoying your competitions.\n\nIn this blog I would like to talk about some of my thoughts and observations about this season.\n\nWhen we started the season, we used all our energy during the first week to analyze the game, to get to know the objects.\n\nThis season’s game artifacts were actually unprecedented and it took time to recognize them. Especially coral is a very difficult game object for me. Aside from the stereotypical designs this year, directing, scoring and moving it is not as simple as it seems. Especially picking up this object from the ground is very difficult.\n\nThis is exactly what we focused on at the beginning of the season. This game object is a huge part of the game and it should have been our top priority. So how were we going to move this object?\n\nWe could use the table, like the majority, or we could try the hard way and pick it up from the ground. After a few prototype tests as a team, I said:\n\n“If we can pick up this object from the ground smoothly and very quickly, we will be 1-0 ahead of the teams using slides. BUT!!! If we can’t do it well enough, we should definitely give it up.”\n\nI still stand by this idea. We started to see it from the first week, maybe you agree with me, that the teams that can pick up this object from the ground smoothly do not have incredibly fast systems, but their cycle times and distances are very short compared to other teams.\n\nWith just 1 meter forward and backward movement of the robot, they can get a new object to score.\n\nWhat do you think?",
