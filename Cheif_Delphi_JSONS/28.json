However, considering the probable discontinuation of Falcons and the enhanced capabilities of the Kraken motor, we are exploring the possibility of switching to Kraken motors. Based on the information gathered, transitioning would require purchasing 3-4 additional Krakens and 4 pinion sets, costing approximately $700-$900 in total. Fortunately, we already have some spare Falcons, minimizing the risk of motor failures. Our primary goal is to enhance our drivetrain. We are wondering if this switch is financially worthwhile, if there are additional components we might need, and what other improvements could further boost our system.",

However, overall, I don’t think the performance difference matters much unless your team is exceptionally skilled. I’d prioritize building a reliable robot and fine-tuning its mechanisms over drivetrain power. If you’re experiencing reliability issues with Falcons that you believe are caused by the drivetrain, that might be a stronger reason to switch compared to minor power differences.  \n\nKraken drives are generally reliable, and I’d recommend dedicating the remaining power from Falcons to other systems instead.  \n\nBudgeting for torque wrenches from **CTRE** or **WCP** with Kraken drives is crucial to prevent motor damage from over-torquing terminal screws.  \n\nThe most significant improvement for your drivetrain likely comes from programming and practice. Study top-tier teams' code to simplify swerve control.  \n\nAn additional tip: Analyze past matches to assess how much time was spent moving from point A to B versus tasks like alignment or placement. This could provide insights into areas needing improvement.",

I’m unsure if there’s a more accessible alternative I could recommend.\n\nProgramming aspects to consider include whether limiting the acceleration improves controllability, if a slower mode with reduced velocity and acceleration would offer better control, and adding buttons to snap the robot to specific angles (as we had for coral stations).

We used a full Falcon 500 swerve throughout all of 2023 and competed in one race in the #2 position in 2024. Over time, we noticed increasing issues with the motors. Before the #4 race, we switched the drive motor to a Kraken and saw a slight performance improvement. This year, we also used a Kraken as the steering motor because our Falcon 500s are outdated, and we didn't have time to test other motors like the Neo.",

In games with full-field cycling (2023, 2024), a higher maximum speed is important (favoring lower ratios with more powerful motors), while in half-field or quarter-field games (2019, 2025), better acceleration and mechanism speed are more critical (likely favoring falcons at a higher ratio with faster mechanisms). You can perform some drivetrain calculations on recalc to aid in making decisions. There was a great thread previously discussing current limits, with 3005 performing well with vortices, and many teams using Neos.",
