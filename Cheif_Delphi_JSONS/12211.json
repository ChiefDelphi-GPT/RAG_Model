I’ve been lurking through some forum posts, but wasn’t really able to find what I was looking for from most of it. I know of the Prusa MK3S+ and Prusa Mini+, but not too much outside of that for printing major parts on the robot. I also want to know what types of filaments that are viable for parts of this nature. I’ve seen mentions of Polycarbonate, Nylon, and potentially even a Nylon + CF blend, but I’m not completely sure. Any advice or suggestions on this topic would be great!",

                    "cooked": "My current recommendations Printers The Bambu Labs X1 Carbon ($1,449) is an amazing printer, we have had ours for about a month, and it has been excellent, prints fantastic parts with PA-CF and Polycarb-CF filaments, and it’s incredibly fast at PLA parts as well.\n\nThat being said, most printers can make reliable parts for a robot; it just depends on how much time you are willing to put into tuning and maintaining them.\n\nWe own 12 Prusa mini+s that have been fantastic as well; most are set up for PLA+, which works for a lot of robot parts. Two of them are currently set up (hardened nozzle and satin print bed) for printing PA-CF and polycarb, and they can make parts as nice as the Bambu Labs printer. It just takes them a lot longer.\n\nOn the cheaper side, something like a Sovol V6 (<$260) can print many engineering filaments (300C nozzle) out of the box but will probably require more tuning. With a hardened nozzle , it can also print carbon fiber-filled filaments\n\nMany teams have had good luck with Ender 3 variants (pro, v2, s1, s1 plus), and those can also be great printers with some care.\n\nFilaments Duramic PLA+ is an excellent filament at a good price.\n\nPrusament makes great filament; many of our 2022 robot parts were made from Prusament PC-Blend filament. We also used Prusament PLA for some parts as well.\n\nWe have also used filament from 3D Maker Engineering . The PLA+ and Polycarb Pro have both worked well for us.\n\nMost polycarb or Nylon-CF filaments will be pretty robust for FRC applications, and in many cases, PLA+ printed parts will work fine if they aren’t taking a lot of impact or force.",

However, we recently added a pair of Prusa Minis to our toolkit and so far, I have been extremely impressed.  On one of them, I’ve switched the nozzle to an 0.8mm hardened steel nozzle, switched to their textured plate, and started printing with their PC with Carbon Fiber.  From my first few test prints, I’ve found it to make parts that are nearly as rigid as those from Markforged and just a tiny bit less dimensionally accurate.  And it prints WAY faster with this nozzle (maybe 3x speed).  I’m still very much a novice with this printer, but so far I’m loving this setup.",

I’ve done a lot of high-stress parts with it, and many of them are still holding up perfectly fine. I haven’t really tested any filaments other than a few kilos I got of Kiwi3d, so I can’t recommend anything there.\n\nOverall, all the Creality printers are pretty good, and are all for a quite nice price too.",

The parts look fantastic. They come out very tough, especially if you run with 4+ perimeters. This is a great balance of price vs print-ability. It is also super easy to set up within Prusa slicer since it is Prusament.\n\nWe will make simple mounts out of PLA/PETG/PLA+. Whatever is available. I like the Jessie Brand , but there are many good choices.\n\nPrusa also makes a PA11 with CF . I have a spool, but haven’t tested it yet. It looks promising.",

I’m a little more interested in multi-material printing (i.e. for dissolvable supports) than I am in multi-color, but both would be pretty amazing… Wondering if you got the one with the AMS & if so how well it is working out for you.

Thanks.\n\nWe do have the AMS and like people above we have mostly used it just to store multiple filaments ready to print and not really for multi-material or multi-color. We have done a couple multi color tests with PLA and it worked great. Getting some high temp break away filament has been on my list so we can see how well it works.\n\nWe have had zero issues with the AMS so far.\n\nThe two issues we had with the printer were a bad case light cable that was causing resets and support sent us new parts to get it fixed.\n\nWe also had one nozzle clog printing special TPU-Carbon Fiber. I believe one of the pieces of CF was too large to fit through the nozzle, probably need to use 0.6mm nozzle with that specific filament.\n\nThe only other complaint I have about the printer is that there aren’t any handles or easy ways to lift, so it’s not convenient to pack up to bring to tournaments or something like that but that’s not much of an issue.",

Both printers are enclosed in their own LACK enclosures as well.\n\nPersonally I have an Ender 3V2 and a Prusa i3 MK3S+ - I really prefer my Prusa over the Ender. The reliability of the Prusa is just unbeat - just being able to click print and know that it’ll work is really nice.\n\nWe primarily printed in PLA+ with a bunch of different brands, specifically ERYONE , Filaments.ca “Canadian Maker Series” , and 3D Printing Canada’s “Value PLA” . We also have used TPU and CF-Nylon for parts on our robots as well.",
