Are you seeing lower FPS than the camera itself is set to?  If you go to the camera server webpage (open a browser to port 1181), what is the camera mode, and are there any modes in the mode table with higher FPS?  The FPS is affected by how much work the camera server has to do–if the camera is in JPG mode, and the viewer is set to the same resolution as the camera, the camera server will just send the camera’s JPG image directly, but otherwise it will have to decompress and recompress the image, which takes time and impacts FPS.",

The situation occurs on a raspberry pi 4 running the latest 2023 wpilibpi and on one of two roborio 1s running 2024 beta 4.\n\nI’m streaming using http://host:1181/?action=stream so the stream should be configured to use whatever resolution and frame rate that the camera is set for. In doesn’t seem to matter what resolution the camera is set for. Regardless of what frame rate is configured for the camera (by code on the Rio and by the Video Settings page on the Pi) the maximum streamed frame rate is 15fps. The two cameras behave slightly differently at configured frame rates above 15fps. For the MS camera, if the configured frame rate is 20 then the streamed rate is 10fps and if it’s set to 30 then the streamed rate is 15fps. For the Logitech camera if the camera is configured for any rate above 15 then it streams 15fps. Reimaging the Rio has not fixed the problem.\n\nAnd, as I mentioned above, and providing further confusion, on a second roborio 1 running the same code, the MS camera streams at the configured rate. However, before I realized how confusing this all was and so I didn’t take good notes at the time, at one point that Roborio also got into a state where it would only stream at 15fps max with the MS camera. When I re-imaged it, however, it began working as expected and I have not been able to drive it back to the broken state.\n\nAll tests on both rios are done with the same laptop (windows 11) deploying the same code from VS Code. It doesn’t matter whether I use Shuffleboard or SmartDashboard for the streaming tests. I’ve tried a different laptop with the same results so I don’t think it is related to the laptop.\n\nAny insights would be much appreciated. Today I’m going to try writing my own code to retrieve images from the camera and see how many I get per second. That might help determine whether the problem lies in the Mjpegserver code or further down the stack.",

No problem getting 30 fps at low resolution.\n\nI ran my camera now attempting 30 fps and get 15 fps with complicated scene and 20 fps for a simpler scene at the highest resolution.\n\nSame test but attempting 20 fps instead of 30 fps and I see about 19 fps for a complicated scene. Apparently forcing it to do what it can’t is not efficient so set the fps close to what it is possible of given the mode and complication of the scene (and roboRIO speed). Knowing where that wastage is might actually be your question. I assume the camera server handling (and having to throw away) too many frames coming at it is the loss that is minimize if the camera rate matches the camera server’s capability.\n\nSince you didn’t post code here’s how to set the camera mode. Use port 1181 to show all the legal modes and properties or enumerate them in the code.",

                    "cooked": "Thanks!\n\nMore experiments today reveal that scene complexity is the main driving factor for the Lifecam – it has little to do with the capabilities of the Rio. For example, with\n\nand a complex scene the achieved frame rate may be 15 or even 7fps. Move the camera to seeing something simpler and it will go to 30fps on the Rio. 640x480 and even 800x600 modes will do 30fps on simple scenes and degrade on more complex ones. I haven’t tested the scene content rigorously but I suspect the scene complexity where fps degradation occurs does not depend on the resolution setting.\n\nOn the Pi\n\nwill happily stream 30fps (and 25Mbps!) to SmartDashboard and reduce to 15 or 7fps as the scene complexity increases. I believe your conclusion that the Rio is overtaxed by this configuration, but the Pi seems entirely limited by the camera capabilities.\n\nI can’t get the Logitech camera to do over 15fps in any scenario – Pi or Rio, different camera modes, etc. The 20, 25 and 30fps modes may be marketing speak or it just may be that the Linux drivers can’t take advantage of them properly.\n\nI’m now eager to try the Pi camera and see how that does. I’m hopeful that it can handle more complex scenes at higher frame rates.\n\nTesting method: on the Rio configure the camera using setVideoMode. On the Pi, configure the camera resolution and fps using the Video Settings page leaving the boxes for setting default values blank. Laptop and Rio were connected via USB; Pi and laptop were attached via hardwired ethernet switch. Streamed video using Shuffleboard with the default compression, fps and resolution settings (-1, -1, 0x0). This means that the Rio/Pi isn’t doing anything other than passing along the frames as it gets them from the camera at the best achievable rate. Point the camera at different scenes and observe the fps change regardless of resolution setting.",

Every year my team has struggled to find a seemingly magic combination of interacting camera choice, camera settings and stream settings that meets the needs for a dashboard view for that year. I started out with the hypothesis that the source of our difficulties was our not understanding how all these things interact to affect the viewed image quality, latency, fps, etc. on the dashboard. For example, we have had problems getting consistent results across different experiments done at different times and in different settings.\n\nThis particular discussion was really enlightening because the lesson learned is that “what the camera is looking at affects its performance” – which may be helpful in understanding why results vary from experiment to experiment.\n\nI’m going to try the Pi camera tomorrow and another USB camera that we’ve used. Barring surprises I’m hoping to have a draft of the document to share before the new year.",

It has the appearance that the cpus are the same relatively slow and cheap and what you are paying for is entirely the sensor.",
