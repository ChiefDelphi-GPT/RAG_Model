One of the areas we focused on was computer vision.\n\nOur team has a LimeLight and has used it with success in the past. The goal we were shooting for was to detect shapes and have the robot navigate towards the desired shape. Lofty goal, but it was good to explore the capability of the system.\n\nI’m familiar(ish) with OpenCV and could help the kids navigate GRIP to create the right filters and get that uploaded to the LimeLight via a GRIP export. But polygon detection seems like something outside LimeLights built capability and thus required some custom OpenCV code.\n\nRunning that OpenCV code on the RIO was god-awfully slow. Like one frame per second. The code probably could be optimized, but it lead me to the following question.\n\nDoes anyone know if LimeLight has the capability to run arbitrary OpenCV code? I assume that’s what it’s doing under the hood, and the form factor and specs make it a pretty nice co-processor. It would also be slick since we already have one.\n\nI know the “.ll” files you upload to the LimeLight contain some type of sudo-code structure but so far I haven’t found any documentation that would lead me to believe this is a full-fledged API. I’m wondering if anyone has experience running more advanced workflows on the LimeLight or if it’s time to start playing around with more open vision systems.",
