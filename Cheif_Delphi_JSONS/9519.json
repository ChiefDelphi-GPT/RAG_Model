                    "cooked": "The current datasheet from the current manufacturer webpage for the Thomas 405ADC38/12 shows maximum continuous and maximum intermittent pressure ratings of 100 psi.    The pressure-flow curves in the same datasheet only include pressures up to 100 psi.\n\nThe Thomas 215ADC38/12 is not shown any longer on the official Thomas webpage for the WOB-L compressors .  A search on the website does not find it under any other category either.  Currently available models are referred to as RideTech Thomas Model 215 compressors at places like Summit Racing , Lethal Performance , and Amazon .  These latest ones differ visually from older ones with a black cylinder cap.  At any of these sellers, the specification for “maximum pressure” is listed as 120 psi.  Even if you look at a circa 2013 datasheet from when these were part of the Thomas portfolio, the maximum intermittent pressure was still listed as 120 psi.\n\nI can’t find a source that shows any manufacturer pressure rating (“intermittent”, “maximum”, “ultimate”, “for a millisecond” or anything) of 125 psi or greater for these compressors.  I also can’t find anything like that for the Viair 90C, but at least that model is called out as legal in the most recent rules ( 2023 R806 ).\n\nWould newly purchased units of either of these Thomas compressors be considered currently legal?  If so, on what basis?  If questioned at an event, I could always pull out a note that shows the Chief Robot Inspector mentioning  these as legal in a CD post from 2015 , but that doesn’t seem like the best approach.\n\nDoes anyone have anything more definitive?",

For R802, any rating will work–if you have no pressure rating at or over 125psi, the compressor is not legal. Where the pressure rating is listed is not particularly relevant as long as it comes from the manufacturer (i.e., you could email the manufacturer, ask if these are rated to 125 psi, and if they say yes bring the email to competition.\n\nIt sounds like R806 isn’t a concern (that is, the specifications match the rule); however, the blue box does provide a little bit of clarity as you noted.\n\nI would not pull CRI on CD from 9 seasons prior as an official source.",

We all know that the compressor can develop much more than that especially when new.  The design of the wob-l piston system will develop bypass leaks when worn.  That is why the manufacturer sells rebuild kits for the piston to bring it back to like new performance.  Most teams are choosing to use smaller compressors as a way to trade off weight and size for other robot mechanisms.  I rarely see one of these compressors during inspections.",
