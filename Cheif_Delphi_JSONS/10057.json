We did have to modify it slightly to suit our robot design. The large bearings on the slides made it more attractive to us than the TTB design.\n\nThings we struggled with:\n\nNo Onshape model made it hard to integrate. There’s like a million parts that all need to be constrained properly.\n\nIt was difficult to figure out how much extension distance we would get for a given height of elevator. This made it difficult to plan out out layout sketch given how close we were operating to the limits, until we finished making the CAD model. I think it ended up being an inch or two too short anyway. We ended up making an equation that would find the extension distance for a given height of elevator, using the numbers from the manual.\n\nWe could not, for the life of us, tie knots properly. It took 2 weeks for us to go from a structurally finished elevator to one with ropes on it. This was because every time a student would tie a knot, once they tightened it, the loop that wound through the tensioner would be too long and hit a pulley. Or, even if the loop was small enough, the run would be too long and we would run out of tensioning distance on the tensioner.\n\nUltimately, we ended up replacing the rope with steel wire rope and steel wire ferrules which we crimped on to make the loop. This resulted in the rope clamp blocks not “biting” deep enough into the rope, so it would slip over time. We had to retighten the blocks each match, and overtightening them would crush the tube because the bolts go through the thin crossbar 2x1 at the top of the elevator.\n\nIf I had to do it again, I probably would use the TTB elevator or use better rope tensioners on the WCP elevator or modify the clamp blocks to be tapped and screwed together for better clamping performance. I did enjoy the stock 3-stage kit that TTB did not have native support for, and I like the WCP bearing block design more overall. Probably easier and cheaper to make modifications to the cable routing on the WCP than to add a 3rd stage to the TTB.",

This was because every time a student would tie a knot, once they tightened it, the loop that wound through the tensioner would be too long and hit a pulley. Or, even if the loop was small enough, the run would be too long and we would run out of tensioning distance on the tensioner.\n\nDo you know what type of knot you were trying? While we didn’t use the greyt elevator for 2023, we copied many of it’s design elements including the same tensioning system (same rope pulleys and ratcheting hex shaft with hole drilled into it).\n\nBrowsing through the documentation I see that it just says “tie a knot” without any indication of what kind of knot should work in this application, which is pretty important:\n\nScreenshot_20231029-142643 1079×1819 320 KB\n\nScreenshot_20231029-142643 1079×1819 320 KB\n\nScreenshot_20231029-142643 1079×1819 320 KB\n\nThe FRC rule of thumb and what we’ve used on all of our elevators is a bowline knot. I spend a good 30mins to an hour every build season when it’s a lifting game walking a few students through tying bowline knots correctly precisely to avoid the issues you’ve described.\n\nI wonder if it would be a good idea to update the documentation @R.C to be a bit more specific/link a guide/video on knot tying. Just an idea.",

The only item we had issues with was on our carriage that would occasionally slam into walls we would  bend or snap the shoulder bolts that held the bearings. We ended up redrilling and tapping these to 1/4-20 and did not have any issues after that.\n\nI also wish the bearing blocks would have used a more standard hole spacing as the extrusion had to be drilled where WCP bearing blocks have a hole spacing that lines up with standard .5” hole patterns.   Not a huge deal, but a slight inconvenience.\n\nOverall we were happy with the TTB elevator and will likely use again if the challenge suits it.\n\nWe did only do a single stage so I do not have direct experience with using multiple stages on the TTB system.",

It’s not like we didn’t know how to tie the bowline, but getting all the lengths just right was a massive game of guess-and-check.\n\nAdamHeard:\n\nFor 1 I pretty heavily rely on importing a giant assembly, grouping components in place, deleting or suppressing what I don’t want, and then repeating for each sub as needed.\n\nIt’s not zero hassle, but sure easier than reassembling from raw parts.\n\nThat’s what we ended up doing. Unfortunately due to how the parts are assembled, it’s surprisingly difficult to get every single screw and ball bearing selected when trying to group the parts. Also, while I was using OnShape to just validate the geometry, the students were all working in Inventor, which I do not know how to use well. I don’t know if it has an equivalent “group” tool. If I was in Solidworks I’d move parts into subassemblies to get them to stick together.",

Just in terms of simplicity they probably are the winner, but both WCP and AM are more compact and has been said already, they are not a kit but a single component.

We had a mentor and a few students working at this before giving up. It’s not like we didn’t know how to tie the bowline, but getting all the lengths just right was a massive game of guess-and-check.\n\nOk I see now what you are talking about nailng the lengths with the turnbuckle.\n\nWe ran a version with a racthet which I believe has a much more user friendly tensioning routine since you can tie the bowline on 1 side and leave the other end however long you want since you just need a simple knot to prevent it pulling through the hole in the hex shaft. Now that the WCP ratchet plates are here I wonder if the Greyt Elevator will use this in favor of a turnbuckle beyond the single stage version? Confirmed by RC.\n\nThis is a rope installation guide I wrote for 3512 for getting our 2023 elevator tensioned:\n\nStarting at carriage, tie a bowline knot in the dyneema (red) and hook that around the hex shaft (blue). Loop dyneema around bottom 1st stage pulley and up to clamping blocks (purple) on 0 Stage.\n\nRun dyneema (green) from clamping blocks up to top 1st stage pulley and down to carriage. Thread dyneema through hole in hex shaft. Tie a knot in the end so it can’t back through the hex shaft hole. We found the best way to thread the dyneema into the hole was to cut it at a very shallow angle and then melt with a flame and then finally pull through with some needle nose pliers. A thin scribe or Allen key can also help stuff into the hole initially.\n\nWe found the best way to thread the dyneema into the hole was to cut it at a very shallow angle and then melt with a flame and then finally pull through with some needle nose pliers.

I’m told it’s to allow teams with a large inventory of existing parts to be able to order only what they need, but I find it generally rather confusing/frustrating.\n\nWe’ve ordered multiple kits from them over the years, and each time we’ve ended up missing critical parts from the kit (that had to be ordered separately); Something that can be a rather big problem in the middle of a chaotic build season. Often times I’ve found mention of what’s needed to be ordered, but buried in a 50+ page manual (and not listed on the product page).\n\nBecause of these ordering issues, we’ve actually *sworn off buying kits from WCP. Things may have improved over the last couple years, but this has been our experience, your mileage may vary .\n\n*We still happily place orders for some of the amazing individual components offered by WCP, just had too many issues with the kits to rely on them in season anymore.",

Fast forward to now… This is we are doing:\n\nEach page assembly will have an option of complete kit or individual parts. Previously we had broken down each item and left it to the user to select qty’s etc… This led to poor results.\n\nimage 858×308 21.2 KB\n\nimage 858×308 21.2 KB\n\nimage 858×308 21.2 KB\n\nEach Kit will have pictures of what comes with it\n\nimage 635×635 97.5 KB\n\nimage 635×635 97.5 KB\n\nimage 635×635 97.5 KB\n\nUser guides are now web based and kit contents are on the forefront\n\nimage 1420×910 94.8 KB\n\nimage 1420×910 94.8 KB\n\nimage 1420×910 94.8 KB\n\nWe also include a kit contents layout BOM now as well:\n\nWe spent most of the summer making sure each individual part had a unique picture. This includes gears , sprockets and other parts that look the same. This was quite a bit of work, but now that we are done with that we are moving onto other improvements which consists of:\n\nAll assembly web pages getting the same information and easier ordering\n\nPreselected assemblies/bundles for 1 click ordering. These will be created as “Bundles”\n\nAll manuals and information moving to gitbooks. This is ongoing and we hope to finish before the end of the season. We are adding more and more information weekly.\n\nGutting and improving all assemblies. Making sure we include all necessary items to build something functional.\n\nI’m always open to feedback and we’ve made changes over the years. Some are easier to implement than others, but I think the experience is getting closer to ideal.",
