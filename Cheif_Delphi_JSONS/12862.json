                    "cooked": "Disclaimer: We found a solution to the bending keys (superglue) but we have no idea how good of a fix this is. If you have the same problem, try this fix at your own risk, I don’t know if/how long it will last\n\nStory: Our team recently got the new MAXSwerve from REV Robotics after waiting since November last year. We were so excited to get these modules that we stopped eating dinner just to start working on them. As an aside, I’d just like to say that other than the problems with the keys, the quality of the modules was immaculate; we were all blown away. After figuring out our own issues we finally were able to produce 4 “functioning” swerve modules. All 4 had normal smooth motion just as REV specified. Our next step was to test out the functionality, so we handed them off to our programing team. After some testing of the modules outside the frame, they started complaining of binding in the drive wheel and plastic shavings falling out as they ran them. Very concerned, we took both modules that were being tested and completely disassembled them finding these stuck between our NEO shaft and encoder bridge.\n\nIMG_6228 1920×2560 208 KB IMG_6226 1920×2560 181 KB 20230115_123324 3000×4000 230 KB\n\nIMG_6228 1920×2560 208 KB\n\nIMG_6228 1920×2560 208 KB\n\nIMG_6226 1920×2560 181 KB\n\nIMG_6226 1920×2560 181 KB\n\n20230115_123324 3000×4000 230 KB\n\n20230115_123324 3000×4000 230 KB\n\nAnd I think it goes without saying, but that’s probably not supposed to happen. We eventually came to the conclusion that somehow the key was sliding out of the key way, wedging itself between the bridge and shaft, then proceeding to be bent around the shaft of the NEO. This is what caused the binding as well as the plastic everywhere. After some more testing of the fit between the key and the keyway, we realized that not only was the key looser than a regular CIM style key but also that the key was loose enough, with the pinion inserted, to fully slide out of the keyway and into the encoder bridge. And I’d also like to stress that we had quite a few team members check over the instructions on orientation of the keyway and clearance with the encoder bridge so I don’t think this was an error on our part but if it is, I’d love to know what we did wrong.\n\nAfter learning that looseness was the issue, we assumed that the best option to fix the key into place was superglue. Just a couple of dabs worth in the keyway was enough to solve the binding and grinding completely on all the modules and we ran them in the frame without a snag for over 30 mins. Now, like I said at the start, I’m not to sure how permanent CA glue will be in the long run especially in a high load environment like a gearbox so take this advice with a grain of salt for now. I just wanted to post this here in case anyone else has had this issue and needed a quick fix or if anyone has a suggestion on a more long term solution. Thank you in advance to anyone who can help",

(This is made worse when the module is ran by hand upside down due to gravity)\n\nOne potential cause we see to double check is the motor pinion orientation, as if the “flange” is pointing down it will apply more pressure to the key to slip into the wrong slot.\n\nPlease let us know if you’ve found the issue!",

The key way is significantly longer (maybe just more inconsistent?) on the 1.0, causing the drop into the encoder bridge.\n\nEdit: REV instructed us to resolve this by just superglueing the key flush with the top.
