                    "cooked": "We have been working on two roboRios.   On the first roboRio with a first Laptop we were able to run Rev Hardware Client to setup SparkMax controllers.   We can also download Java code using the radio.   Initially we were also able to update roboRio Firmware.   Since then we can no longer update roboRio Firmware.   We also can not run phoenix tuner over usb.   Phoenix tuner over the radio will see the roboRio but doesn’t see any devices.\n\nThis first laptop on the second 2022 robot can not do anything over the USB connection.    (The SparkMax’s were setup on the first system so we haven’t tried RHC again.)   Phoenix Tuner with USB can find the roboRio and download the tool but does not see any CAN devices.   Didn’t try it over the radio.\n\nThis 2022 robot will not allow us to download code using the radio.   And the first laptop can not download the code over usb.\n\nLuckily our team has a laptop with Win 10 Pro that can download code over USB, and successfully ran Phoenix tuner to reprogram its talons to the second robot.   But we had to port the program to that laptop and run the IDE from there…\n\nThe first laptop is a two year old Dell with a quad core 11th gen i7 and 16 GB of ram.   Its my personal laptop and I bought it specifically for use on the robotics team.\n\nWhat can we do to fix it so that we can connect properly over usb to run roboRio Imaging Tool, Phoenix Tuner, and download code?   And how do we change the 2022 robot so we can download code over the radio?\n\nI haven’t swapped radios yet.   The 2022 Radio is brand new.\n\nIts extremely frustrating to have all issues with these products every January/February/ and March.   Then not use them for a full year and expect to be able to use them again.\n\nThis problem laptop is running Win 10 Home.   All of its drivers were updated in January via the Dell website.  There are no errors in its Hardware List.   The event log is showing “Can Not Connect”, “Permission Denied”, and “Communication or Connection Timeout” Errors.  We have disable the Windows Firewall on the Current Network.   Then we disable the Windows Firewall on Public and Private networks too.   And we have rebooted numerous times.",

Let’s see if we can get to the bottom of this.\n\nSounds like you have a few things going on, so I’d first like to confirm a few things.\n\nYou mention testing over USB.  Can you confirm that you’re only using USB-C to connect to REV components using the REV Hardware Client (i.e. for firmware updates), and using USB-A to USB-B (printer cable) to the RoboRio for all other testing (reimaging Rio, deploying code, using Phoenix tuner, etc)?\n\nOn the laptop that is unable to connect to the roborio, can you show a screenshot of the network tab on the driver station (assuming it’s installed on this machine).  It would also help if you could share any errors you receive from the deployment process in vscode.\n\nWhen connected to the Rio via USB, can you confirm whether you can successfully ping the roborio mDNS hostname and/or USB IP address? Info on how to do that can be found here .",
