In some situations you can use an actual full-rotation collector, but ones that will work with a data line AND power aren’t easy to get.  Windmill collectors with three phase lines aren’t super expensive, if you can get down to -just- a DC motor on the rotating part.\n\nWith careful setup you can have a cable arch where the (spiralled and reinforced) cables point straight up, arch over, and go straight down into the rotating part.  Ideally on the center line.  With this you can get a part of a turn as the twist in the bundle goes up and down.  Kind of easy to booger up, though.\n\nI discovered that Igus has a line of plastic rotary cable chain assemblies!  The biggest actually has a pretty good hole in it!

Normal ones work between straight and a pretty tight curl.  THESE go between a large radius backward and a small radius forward.  If you are sufficiently crazy, you can set up a milling machine (or some flush cutters) and MAKE this special chain:\n\nimage 325×230 23 KB\n\nimage 325×230 23 KB\n\nimage 325×230 23 KB\n\nHere’s a comparison of the stock and modified:\n\nimage 306×186 27.5 KB You can download the Igus CAD model Its kind of a big print… I re-drew things and tuned it up to use an 8” aluminum lazy susan/turntable bearing.\n\nimage 306×186 27.5 KB\n\nimage 306×186 27.5 KB\n\nimage 407×288 39.3 KB\n\nimage 407×288 39.3 KB\n\nimage 407×288 39.3 KB\n\nThe outer print is messed up (my profile somehow changed from 255C extrusion temperature to 220C.

We are discussing shooters… Here’s a out of the box concept for rotating the turret.  With a worm gear, 120 RPM on a 100 tooth gear, 4 starts is 3,000 RPM on the motor, which isn’t completely insane.  May still be too fast for a worm.  We’ll have to see.  It has the big advantage of not needing to go through the bottom plate (no space down there) or sticking up into the shooter space.  Probably less backlash than a gearbox plus right angle drive.

This isn’t exactly a part that can be in an oil bath…\n\nThe moment the worm skips something is going to get mangled. I like the concept in general, it is clever, but it may be a bridge too far at the moment.\n\nThe rational behind the large diameter worm is to reasonably mesh with the straight cut spur that is the worm wheel, yes?",

Hmmm.  A much longer shaft and a smaller worm is almost certainly a better choice.  Plus, easier to machine a full-metal one.  Easier to get some extra bearings in too.  I kinda liked the super-simple “just whack it on the motor shaft” aspect But the big one is delightfully wacky!\n\nI don’t think the axial loads will be too scary on a turret, but its a valid concern!  They are often quite large in worm gear systems, especially winches!\n\nYeah, durability and lubrication will be a problem.  A little grease is really all I can offer it.  That gear is definitely NOT the right choice; both too big and way too rough.  Next test model will be a 3DP part with actual spiral angle on the teeth.",

My chain is modified to have a fixed reverse bending radius that is quite close to the inner guide tube radius.\n\nWe’ll have to spin it fast with the Kraken tester tomorrow and see what happens!",

If the thing is stalled, the nergy is probably going into the deformation of the turret, worm gear, the individual joints that mounted the mechanism on to the turret, or the mechanism itself.",
