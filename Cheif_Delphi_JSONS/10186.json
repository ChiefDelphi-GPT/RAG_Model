                    "cooked": "Finally getting around to working with PV for 2023.\n\nFirst question: after install of 2023.4.2 limelight image to limelight v2, the LL led had both left and right segments lit. After downloading the LL hardwareconfig.json file and uploading it, the LL only lights the left segment when turned on. Is this expected?\n\nSecond question: I have had a devil of a time getting PV on the LL to identify the reflective tape targets for the 2023 game. I have read the docs, CD posts and fooled with the settings extensively and after a lot of that fooling around I finally got PV to sort of recognize the tape targets on the scoring posts. But, PV constantly switches back and forth between the high and low targets or no target at all. I blocked one of the tape targets and it still switches between have a target and not target. It switches so fast and returns no target so often, our code can’t make sense of it. I could live with switching between targets but switching between “I have a target” and “I don’t have a target” when a target is in the field of view does not work.\n\nI expect to be able to configure PV to return a steady target list so our code can determine when we have or don’t have a target. This is how it worked for past games using the limelight firmware. I did not have anywhere near this much difficulty getting the LL to work.\n\nAny ideas on what is going on here?",

Bright ambient lighting, darkened room? Sunlight, ceiling lights?",

This yields a black raw view with the targets very clearly visible in green.\n\nThe robot is about 6 feet from target, not moving. The environment is a high ceiling shop space with overhead lights. The room is not that bright. There is some sunlight coming in from high windows.\n\nIt seems like the exposure and brightness yield a “box” in the shape of the target on the processed view, that box is black outlined with a white edge. PV seems to switch back and forth identifying the box as a target and the outline as a different target. I will get a screen shot when I get to the lab next.",

I couldn’t get my LL with PV to connect to the browser (of course it worked the last time I had it on) but here’s what I see on RPi PV. In this instance the HUE range was the tiniest bit too tight. (Obviously not the game poles just two pieces of tape hanging on a box in my basement. The little dots between the large tape and smaller tape is the model of the 2022 hub high target still available for use.)

I’d probably click set to average on a “typical” looking pixel then expand range a couple of times again on pixels that look like what should be included for min and max. Then use the slider bars gently to get the best results.\n\nBecause of those uncertainties and multiple steps I consider the color picker more of a novelty feature since the slider bars with the colored cues are excellently done and I can tune faster with them than fussing with color picker.\n\nMy test strip right now with one set of the the LimeLight 2+ LEDs has hues 54-70 and the color picker covered that range with 51-71 and 54-74 on two successive tries with careful pixel selection.\n\nPicker did values 200-220 with the correct range being 174-255. I guess I can’t judge typical min and max values as well as I can hues. I got only part of the tape until I adjusted with the slide bar.\n\nThe saturation is 255 and the color picker covered that easily with 238-255.",

Started with the same problems I have documented here. Really poor tracking and no adjustment seeming to make any real difference. I also tried the settings suggested by SLAB-Mr.Thomas and saw little change to the problem. I have the config and pictures of the PV console of that situation…but\n\nAt a point in testing, the PV web console views of the camera became unresponsive. I switched to the settings tab and clicked Restart PhotonVision. When PV restarted, an amazing thing happened. The PV console reflected a completely different configuration and the target idenfitication was working just as I had expected when I started. Target identification was accurate, solid and repeatable. I have no idea where the settings came from or how the PV config changed on restart, but I will upload the config files from when it was failing to when it started working shortly.\n\nWith PV working as expected, I started testing our code to move the robot in response to the data returned in the PV api. This went ok except for this new strange issue where PV (I assmue on the camera but maybe on the RoboRio) has a network table communication problem and the PV library on the RIO reports no new data sent by the camera and I am unable to control the LEDs. Restarting the code or the LL seems to clear this up for a bit but then it comes back. It got worse to the point I could not really do any testing as the communication between our code and PV on the LL failed regularly…and then it work for a few minutes. Using outlineviewer you can see the tabel entry for photonvision/cameraname is fully fleshed out and other times there is no data in that sub table. Really frustrating.\n\nI get errors on the console suggesting the camera name I am using is not found in the network tables but then moments later there is a message saying the camera name was found. Defintately something going on with the network tables link between PV on the RIO and PV on the LL but after lots of testing I could not find a cause. I will be back in the lab tomorrow and collect more information.",
