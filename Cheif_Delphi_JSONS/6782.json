I’ve been wondering if such a thing is applicable in a command-based framework, or is even advisable. The aim here is to have 100% code coverage, and preferably not utilize simulations. Teams who have experimented with unit testing, I’d love to hear what your takeaways are!\n\nedit: we use java",

It is both extremely difficult and low value. If you forced me to pick a code coverage number I’d be aiming closer to 75% just because I find that to be where things tend to organically end up.\n\nBut code coverage is not always a great metric to use, there’s a lot of difficulties in computing it and it’s better to focus on testing edge cases than making sure every single line is “covered”",

If you’re doing it manually, then why have tests?\n\nWell, the simple answer is you reason about your code, think about the behaviors you want and then build tests around them. Then as you work and correct behaviors you don’t like add tests to ensure you don’t create regressions in those behaviors.\n\nOr, I guess if you want to do TDD you kinda invert that. You determine the behaviors you want, write tests expecting those behaviors and implement until your tests go green. Then when you see a behavior you don’t like you write a test that asserts the behavior you want (or update the existing tests) and update code until they all go green.\n\nBut really the process is no different than what you’d do seeking code coverage which is why over time that number will have some point it tends to sit around.",

We ended up super complicating the Quokka design (with our own design) by adding a pivot on the shooter, so two degrees of freedom to line up and shoot (technically three with the elevator that the shooter was on). Additionally there was a lot of opportunity for the robot to run the shooter/intake mechanism into our own bumper or swerve modules - causing ourselves damage, so there was the need to put in some overly aggressive safeguards to ensure we didn’t shoot ourselves in the foot.\n\nThe simulation tools allowed our programmers to spend all the time they needed to get the math done while the robot was being assembled, and then most of the time on the actual robot was just spent validating the behaviors from sim. It also allowed our programmers to validate some assumptions they were making when we had to make adjustments at times they didn’t have access to the robot (like overnight at our first competition when the pivot nut sheared and we decided it should not move - so they redid the math to get the setpoints they wanted with no movement from the pivot and then just tested it on the real robot in the morning before opening ceremonies).\n\nWithout being involved in the process I don’t know how much extra complication it was to set up the simulation in the first place, but it was worth every amount of effort they put in.\n\nAlso, while it was not technically TDD it kind of fulfills a similar role as you are able to have a simulated test environment pass the smell test and then it’s a smaller amount of testing on the actual robot to verify.",

Anyway the point is - I have a plan on what to code.\n\nThat’s not what I see my student software team do. They tend to open VSCode Java, start coding and then soon ask, “What are we doing?”\n\nI have come to realize with the help of the WPILib Command-Based guru that the command-based succinct, nearly natural language model of what the students want the robot to do lends itself to the students being able to easily, quickly experiment with robot actions with barely a thought before hand other than we want to make it move.\n\nI might still sketch a FSM diagram or two or jot down a few words but these days it’s mostly to make sure I’m understanding and communicating an answer to a student question that arises after they’ve almost completed the action.\n\nI’m not giving up on testing but it’s done to the real-time of the coding and seeing the action.\n\n[Want to know how old I am? For a short time soldering irons were used but soon after that when I started much coding I got one maybe two compiles and executes on a computer per day. This went on for a few years. I can play computer line-by-line of code really well because we didn’t have much else than our thoughts. Now it’s continuous compile as you type each character and one deploy per minute or so.]",

What would coverage without simulation look like?\n\nIn my professional experience, strict test-driven-development is a mistake that locks you into a very strict “waterfall” design pattern where you’re forced to codify your contract before you’ve fully learned the problem-space.  This is especially troublesome for FRC , where robots are essentially prototypes and the requirements are rapidly-changing.\n\nIt’s worth noting that the Command-based framework itself is rather thoroughly unit-tested on the WPILib end.  That’s a much more reasonable target for unit tests, as it lasts a lot longer than yearly team code and needs to withstand constant modification while maintaining its original contract.",
