                    "cooked": "TL;DR: If your robot is randomly freezing for a couple seconds for no reason with no discernable signal of what’s causing the problem, maybe you’re bouncing off the memory limit.\n\nJust wanted to share this with the community in case someone else has a similar issue…\n\nDuring one of our practice matches and our second qualification match at Champs this year, we noticed a very perplexing type of robot software failure. It was almost like musical chairs… The robot would drive for maybe 5-10 seconds then sit motionless for about 2 seconds. The amount of time motionless was pretty consistent, but the time the robot was working increased a bit as the match went on.\n\nInterestingly, the signal light continued to flash during this time. Not, as we have experienced tons of times, like the robot lost comms or something due to a loose connection. Sometimes a loop time overrun message would be displayed when the robot came back, pointing to random functions. Sometimes robotPerioidic(), sometimes Shuffleboard.updateValues(). Other times there were no messages. But never a code restart or anything rebooting that indicated a fatal error.\n\nWe would redeploy code and it was fine, other times it seemed like it was immediately having the issue, even while the robot was disabled. We tried changing a bunch of different things with the help of the CSAs but the issue persisted. Of course we tried to find loops the code could get stuck in or blocking operations and found nothing. The typical issues like cables and such were suspected, but nothing was found. At one point to seemed like reseating the Ethernet cables in the VH-109 resolved the issue. But of course it wasn’t so simple.\n\nAs you can maybe see in the below poorly-captured image of the DSLog (using Orangelight’s DSLog-Reader 2.4), the DS remained in Teleop mode the whole time but the dashed nature of the top line shows missing Robot Teleop packets.\n\nPXL_20240418_160703683.MP 1920×2560 349 KB\n\nPXL_20240418_160703683.MP 1920×2560 349 KB\n\nPXL_20240418_160703683.MP 1920×2560 349 KB\n\nEventually, we were able to catch the issue in pit. We sampled CPU usage using VisualVM and saw the same unhelpful random functions blamed for the 2 seconds of time stuck in the main thread. We checked top to see if some other process was using CPU but there wasn’t. free showed some free memory.\n\nWe then managed to experience the issue on the wireless practice field. One of the matches we noticed that the issue magically appeared a minute before the match (while disabled) after waiting a few minutes for other robots to get set up. The logs from the field again showed some red herrings, but the wonderful FTA suggested the idea of a memory leak.\n\nWe had experienced out of memory issues in the past but they usually presented as, like you would suspect, fatal out-of-memory errors, not multiple-second lag spikes.\n\nWe then looked at the allocated heap size in VisualVM and saw it growing from about 15MB at start all the way to its configured maximum of 127MB. Actual usage was going a bit up and down but slowly creeping up as more space was allocated. Once the memory usage started bumping up against the 127MB limit, the issues began.\n\nWe tried to take a heap dump but were unable to open it, perhaps failing at transferring the file to the PC. However, we knew there was some code that we suspected was causing high CPU usage when disabled and figured maybe it could be causing the other issue as well. Once we removed the suspect code (which was repeatedly rebuilding the auto path based on Network tables inputs), the issue was resolved and memory usage stayed consistently about 15MB. Later on, we ran the problematic code in sim and were able to successfully pull a heap dump which showed a ton of data left over from the PathPlanner AutoBuilder JSON parsing library.\n\nSince we were performing the severely-leaking task only while the robot was disabled, all our symptoms began to make sense. First off, we didn’t see it in normal testing/tethered practice field because we didn’t sit around with the robot on but not enabled. Also, it explains why we saw dropouts at a much higher rate while disabled than enabled, since the rate at which we were consuming memory with the path planning was much faster than our runtime command scheduling/creation.  Of course, it further explains why it would take a few minutes for the issue to show up, as we waited for the memory to fill.\n\nI don’t understand why garbage collection (or whatever it was trying to do in order to shrink the heap) took nearly two seconds, but it’s better now and that’s about as much as I’m concerned. Perhaps the garbage collector had trouble identifying/freeing the specific garbage created the library?\n\nAgain a huge thanks to all the FIRST technical support volunteers, we always seem to find new and creative ways to break our control system and confuse everyone involved.\n\nIf anyone has similar stories or any thoughts on why this issue presented in such an unintuitive way, please share.",

We don’t explicitly set a value.\n\nIts not super surprising that a full collection with a lot of garbage would take 2 seconds.

Did SerialGC have better worse-case/average pause times than G1GC? I also wonder if the settings of G1GC are optimal, in particular the max latency of 1 ms in GradleRIO seems low to me.\n\nThad_House:\n\nIts not super surprising that a full collection with a lot of garbage would take 2 seconds.\n\nThat’s pretty surprising to me for such a small heap with presumably mostly dead objects, though less so now that I realize that it’s SerialGC, since it does not do any incremental marking. If that’s the case, having maximum pause times of 2 seconds seems like a major disadvantage of SerialGC.\n\nBut, it’s strange to me if what’s happening was:\n\nwait for a few minutes → heap full with dead objects → full GC performed → wait 10 seconds → heap full → full GC performed → etc.\n\nIf the pause time was caused solely by the CPU cost of doing a full GC, why would it take some time for the memory to fill up, but then keep triggering every 10 seconds. Also, wouldn’t the GC relatively fast if there’s mostly garbage, since theoretically the GC (which is copying) is proportional to the live set and not the heap size? Unless the hypothesis is that the misbehaving code was creating many copies of objects that remained live , and they happened to be enabled right before they ran out of memory, causing a lot of full GC attempts, but then why did they never experience a OOM crash?",
