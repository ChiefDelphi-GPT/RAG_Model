The point of that extra loop is so that if your connector comes unplugged from the Spark you do not lose the whole can bus. For durability I recommend you replace this with a new cable assembly. Now if this extra loop just got pulled out and if your “can wires keep getting cut”, I think we need a bigger picture of how your electronics are mounted and of your wiring job as these are bigger issues that should be resolved.",

We have already replaced the Can wires of the sparks. As for the can bus wires getting cut, after looking over the all the can connections its seems that the wires are getting cut from the plastic that protects where some Can wires connect to others. The little white plastic. After looking at how my teammates were handling what are electrical is mounded on I think that some of my teammates were just being a little too rough causing some wires to be tugged to the point that they got ripped out. I can try to take a photo of the electrical set up tomorrow. I do think it was just a design fault on my part with the set up.",
