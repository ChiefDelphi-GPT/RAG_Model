My team is hoping to make use of snap rings this year, particularly for the gearboxes on our elevator(s). They have already designed one that way so I want to try and make it work… We have no lathe and myself and multiple other mentors have tried to find someone to do it for us with no success. We do however, have a Tormach PCNC 1100 and there is a Tormach 24R at my office that I can use.</p>\n<p>I was thinking that we could machine soft jaws that can hold 3/8\" and 1/2\" hex shafts in a vertical position, clamp that in our vise, and cut the snap ring grooves with an appropriately sized slitting saw, probably on the 1100 to get a low enough spindle speed. I am aware this will only work for a sufficiently short shaft.</p>\n<p>I am trying to think about why this would not work before I buy the tooling, and I just can’t see why it wouldn’t, but as I said I have absolutely zero real education on these matters so I was hoping I may be able to get some insight. Thanks.</p>\n\n**Cleaned Version:**  \nBefore getting started, I want to clarify that I’m not a machinist; I majored in economics instead. This entire project feels more like a creative endeavor than a precise engineering task. Our team plans to utilize snap rings this year, specifically for the gearboxes on our elevators. They’ve already designed a system that works, so we’re aiming to adapt it… Unfortunately, we don’t have access to a lathe, and neither I nor several other mentors have been able to secure someone who can perform the necessary operations. However, we do possess a Tormach PCNC 1100 and a Tormach 24R, both of which we can use to our advantage.\n\nWe’re considering creating soft jaws capable of holding 3/8\"- and 1/2\"-diameter hex shafts in a vertical position, clamping them in place within our shop’s vice. The plan is to use an appropriately sized slitting saw to cut the snap ring grooves. Given the capabilities of the Tormach 1100, we aim to achieve a sufficiently low spindle speed for this operation. One concern is that this method might only be viable for relatively short shafts, given its limitations.\n\nAt this stage, we haven’t identified any clear reasons why this approach wouldn’t work, though our lack of formal machining training leaves us uncertain. We’d appreciate any insights or advice you might be able to provide. Thank you.",

We just want to finally make use of them, and I think this is a good opportunity for everyone involved to learn more about machining. We haven't done something on the machine for the first time in a few years now. Maybe this should have been worked out earlier, but if we need to do anything other than adjusting feeds and speeds, we will go back to tapping the shafts and work it out after the build season.",

Stick shaft into collet into mill head. Set up snap-ring cutter in vise of mill. Align cutter near-center on shaft and at proper place. Fire up mill at typical lathe speed and very carefully feed snap-ring cutter into shaft until you get to the right depth. Obviously this is a “be cautious” move, but the basic idea is to spin the shaft and align the cutter.",

One potential issue is that you might not find a slitting saw that matches the size of the snap ring groove you're aiming to create. A helpful tip is to purchase a cutting tool that's slightly smaller than the slot you're trying to make. Once you've done that, design your slot so that the extra portion extends into whatever you're attempting to retain, such as bearing surfaces or gears. This method should function well as long as the extra part isn’t excessively thick—it should prevent weakening the shaft or reducing the contact area with the bearing.",

                    "cooked": "The user is discussing the use of a snap-ring cutter on a milling machine instead of a lathe. They suggest using a collet in the mill and positioning the cutter near-center on the shaft before carefully feeding it in. However, this method introduces complications due to the mill's design, which is not optimized for turning operations. Using a collet in a mill may lead to inaccuracies or vibrations since mills primarily use chucks or spindle supports. Additionally, relying on snap rings requires precise alignment to avoid binding or stripping the cutter, adding unnecessary risk.\n\nAn alternative suggestion is using a screw and washer setup, which is simpler, provides a positive grip, and avoids the need for precise alignment, making it more beginner-friendly. While the process described could work similarly on a lathe, switching to a mill adds unnecessary complexity. A screw and washer method ensures smoother learning without the associated risks, promoting better outcomes for beginners.",

Gets slightly more complicated with hex shaft, but nowadays with 3D printers you can make a collet adapter for a hex shaft very easily. They also sell 1/2\" hex collets for fairly cheap. It’s worth noting that the Tormach PCNC 1100 uses a R8-style collets, which are a bit more expensive. When we bought our mill we got a few Drill Chuck collets with it, and I think if it was me I would try to make one of those work first. I think the biggest limitation to using a mill for this kind of thing would be the length of the stock you’re trying to groove, since mill collets usually are somewhat depth-limited and you don’t want long stock spinning unsupported out the end of a spindle. Woops, got me too. Darn necro posts.",

To address this issue, I propose creating a sheet metal jig made from material no thicker than your snap rings. Here's an illustration similar to what I designed:\n\n![diameterJig](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/uploads/default/original/4X/4/3/c/43c78b9ed82ca1cc449b871ae2edf64298ebb973.png)\n\nThis jig aims to drop entirely into the groove when the correct diameter is achieved. Until then, observing where the jig pauses offers insight into how much further to cut—practicing and calibrating along the way. A single jig may suffice if used for consistent or recurring sizes. Additionally, adjusting the taper angle beyond necessity was unnecessary, as demonstrated in LibreOffice Impress.",

This design resembles a sheet metal piece attached to the end of a barbecue fork.\n\nFor a round shaft, select the parallel sides such that their length equals the desired depth of the cut. This ensures the distance from the shaft's edge to the jig's opening matches proportionally without any offset. However, for polygonal shafts, like a hexagon, align the jig with one side when measuring since the angle affects the calculation.\n\nNext, choose the taper angle so that the remaining depth to cut is a simple fraction—either 1/8 or 1/10—of the space between the end of the aligned shaft and the notch's end. I'm unsure whether this involves trigonometric functions like arctangent or arcsine at this stage of the morning.",
