My team is hoping to make use of snap rings this year, particularly for the gearboxes on our elevator(s). They have already designed one that way so I want to try and make it work… We have no lathe and myself and multiple other mentors have tried to find someone to do it for us with no success. We do however, have a Tormach PCNC 1100 and there is a Tormach 24R at my office that I can use.\n\nI was thinking that we could machine soft jaws that can hold 3/8\" and 1/2\" hex shafts in a vertical position, clamp that in our vise, and cut the snap ring grooves with an appropriately sized slitting saw, probably on the 1100 to get a low enough spindle speed. I am aware this will only work for a sufficiently short shaft.\n\nI am trying to think about why this would not work before I buy the tooling, and I just can’t see why it wouldn’t, but as I said I have absolutely zero real education on these matters so I was hoping I may be able to get some insight.

                    "cooked": "I’m assuming you’ve considered alternatives for retention, and settled on snap rings because you need very little stickout past the end of the bearing, and are concerned with the potential for things like screw heads or roll pins to get caught? (Because the easiest option is probably to cross-drill, put a fastener in it, and back the fastener up with a washer. A hex head cap screw and a Nylon locknut with matching hex takes up some space, but it will bear evenly on the washer on the flats of the nut and bolt.) And you don’t want to thread the ends and install a washer or plate, for any number of reasons?\n\nFor grooves, the big consideration is whether your groove will be precise enough so that under expected thrust loads, the snap rings doesn’t pop out. Too shallow, too deep, too wide or too tapered will all trigger this problem.\n\nI think the method described will work fine. Realistically, you can’t feed a slitting saw very hard in anything but ideal conditions, so if your milling vise has simple parallel hard jaws, I think you could just grab it across the flats (because as you said, it’s a short shaft) and tighten it hard, and let the CNC do the work of many tedious tiny passes.\n\nThat said, there are lots of ways to accomplish this, and for teams without easy access to traditional CNC, hand cutting, or using lasercut or 3-D printed tooling to allow you to guide a blade would actually work decently well.",

We just want to finally make use of them, and I think this is a good opportunity for everyone involved to learn more about machining. We haven’t done something on the machine for the first time in a few years now. Maybe this should have been worked out before the build season, but I think if we need to do anything other than adjusting feeds and speeds we will go back to tapping the shafts and work it out after build season.",

Align cutter near-center on shaft and at proper place.\n\nFire up mill at typical lathe speed and very carefully feed snap-ring cutter into shaft until you get to the right depth.\n\nWith the right tooling, this may also work in a drill press.\n\nObviously this is a “be cautious” move, but the basic idea is to spin the shaft and align the cutter.",

One collet that is the right size to fit your shaft.\n\nA “snap ring cutter” on a lathe is a grooving tool and the closest “equivalent” on a mill is a slitting saw, which you do not want to be spinning at lathe speeds, those require low SFM and feeds and a rotary table or CNC control.\n\nThe other option is to use some a thin grooving insert on a boring head, but you will run into stiffness issues as you are trying to cut a long cantilvered work with a long cantileverd tool while doing a discontinuous cut.

One problem that you might have is that you may not be able to find a slitting saw the same size as the snap ring groove  that you are trying to make.  One trick here is buy the cutting tool which is as small as possible but still bigger than the slot you are trying to make.  Then, design your slot so that the “extra” part of the slot is inside whatever you are trying to retain (bearing, gear, etc.).  This should work fine as long as the “extra” is just a few hundredths of an inch - otherwise you might weaken the shaft or lose too much contact area with the bearing.",

You will need to cut grooves and measure quite a few times to get the dimensions right.  A smaller OK slitting saw will work better for this than a big one.  1\" OD slitting saws are available.  For this super-shallow depth you can probably cut to depth, traverse, and cut again to get the groove width right.  Or stack two slitting saws to get the right width.  An 0.020\" plus a 0.018\" would probably do the trick.  You might look up the tolerance on the groove width; McM didn’t list that.\n\nMcMaster-Carr is the complete source for your plant with over 595,000 products. 98% of products ordered ship from stock and deliver same or next day.\n\nAn important tip: snap rings use both sides of the groove for holding.  Thus, oversized grooves are significantly weaker than correct width grooves.  A wide groove hiding under a bearing is going to be kinda weak.\n\nAlso important: the corners on regular hex are too large to stretch a 1/2\" shaft snap ring over.  You will yield the snap ring.  If you are super close to the end you can sort of wind them on, but you are much better off clearing the corners.  I think round corner hex -might- be small enough…",

Set up snap-ring cutter in vise of mill. Align cutter near-center on shaft and at proper place.\n\nFire up mill at typical lathe speed and very carefully feed snap-ring cutter into shaft until you get to the right depth.\n\nI’m 100% with @EricH here - the relative motions here are exactly what would be going on in a lathe and the milling machine is made to handle that sort of side load.\n\nDrill presses don’t like side loads and can easily unset the chuck - bad day for everyone.\n\nMy opinion is that if you don’t have to use snap rings, don’t.  Snap ring grooves are way harder to do right as @Tristan_Lall said.  When everything is spot on; they’re great.  When things aren’t, they’ll make you cry because they won’t stay in.\n\nAs you said, you don’t have to do it this way and I wouldn’t consider working up a janky (for a beginner) way to make these grooves if you have other alternatives.  Snap ring grooves wouldn’t be the thing I’d give to someone just starting out. A screw and a washer on the end of the shaft would be a way more beginner-friendly task.  If you are dead set on snap rings, find someone with lathe that can help you.\n\nA number of us here with machines get well versed in figuring out how to do things given the tooling we have on hand but that’s after getting the basics down.\n\nIt’s just easy to mess up as a first project and setting yourself up for success in your intro to machining will probably do better with a less complex setup.\n\nOh wow - didn’t realize this thread was months old already…",

Gets slightly more complicated with hex shaft, but nowadays with 3D printers you can make a collet adapter for a hex staft very easily.\n\nThey also sell 1/2\" hex collets for fairly cheap.\n\nIt’s worth noting that the Tormach PCNC 1100 uses a R8-style collets, which are a bit more expensive . When we bought our mill we got a few Drill Chuck collets with it, and I think if it was me I would try to make one of those work first.\n\nI think the biggest limitation to using a mill for this kind of thing would be the length of the stock you’re trying to groove, since mill collets usually are somewhat depth-limited and you don’t want long stock spinning unsupported out the end of a spindle.\n\nzog:\n\nOh wow - didn’t realize this thread was months old already…\n\nWoops, got me too.

I’m thinking something similar to this profile not at all inspired by Darth Vader’s helmet, though it looks like it:\n\ndiameterJig 755×178 2.08 KB\n\ndiameterJig 755×178 2.08 KB\n\ndiameterJig 755×178 2.08 KB\n\nThe idea is that when the diameter is just right, the jig drops all the way down onto the groove.  Until you get there, where the jig stops gives you a good idea how much farther to cut (with a bit of practice/calibration, of course).  You’d need a different one for each diameter unless you put multiple notches on a jig (2 makes sense to me, likely facing opposite directions), but you likely don’t do many different diameters.  You also likely wouldn’t need such a wide taper angle; I did this in LibreOffice Impress to communicate the concept rather than provide an ideal geometry.",

The jig will look something like the sheet metal piece riveted on the end of a barbecue fork.\n\nSelect the parallel sides length to be the equal to the depth you want to cut in a round shaft.  This is so that the distance between the outside of the shaft and the end of the opening will be proportional to the required depth of cut still required, with no offset.  If cutting polygonal (e.g. hexagonal) shaft, you’ll have to bring the jig in perpendicular to a side to get this measurement, of course.\n\nSelect the taper angle so that the depth left to cut is an easy fraction (like 1/8 or 1/10 ) of the space between the end of the round/aligned shaft and the end of the notch.  It’s too early in the day for me to figure out if this is arctangent or arcsine or something else.  I may or may not get back to it after work this evening.",
