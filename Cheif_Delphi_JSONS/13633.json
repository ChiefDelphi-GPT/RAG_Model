(Thanks CTE manager & budget!)\n\nWe only cut aluminum and polycarb sheet last year, and one thing I’d like to be able to do is precision cut tube on it like people do on their Omios. However, reading this past thread , it seems like that could be a bit of a production. Is anyone routinely precision cutting 2x1 tube on their waterjet? If so, I assume there is some method/jig for repeatedly locating the tube end on the table (like the Omio tube jig). And I assume there is some way to deal with (avoid) the imprecise exit cuts on the far side of the tube. Wondering if people might just submerge the far side of the tube and use a piece of waste steel inside (instead of wood as the thread above suggests… not that easy to make a bunch of 1.75x.75 or 1.875x.875 pieces of wood).

Or I guess you could clamp down fixture stock, cut the fixture with the jet, then clamp part stock into the fixture?\n\nI’ve never used waterjet cut features as final bore diameters either, just as locations for finishing passes with other tools.\n\nI don’t see how using this tool for tubing saves you time or money or even gains you precision.\n\nWhy do you want to cut tubing on it?\n\nYou can do really cool sheet metal style work with the waterjet tool - investing in a press brake for bending 0.060-0.100 5052 aluminum will get you a much longer way to productive work than figuring out how to cut tubes on the jet.

You would need to recut the square edge/corner of your machine ever lost home, but allowed for an accurate (don’t know specifically how accurate), repeatable home/start location.\n\nAll that being said, I’d agree with others above that cutting 2x1 aluminum tube on your water seems like more effort than it’s worth. But I could be totally wrong. Submerging half your tube under water with a steel plate inside the tube may be enough to not pierce/damage the far side of the tube. If your steel plate came out relatively undamaged so that you can reuse it for multiple pieces of tubes, that could be relatively sustainable. If you need a new piece for every length of tubing you cut, that sounds a lot less sustainable/practical.",
