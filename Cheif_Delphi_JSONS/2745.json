                    "cooked": "Hello,\n\nI am a student programmer for FRC team 5735, trying to get computer vision working for our robot. After much deliberation, we decided that our goal this season would be to get reef alignment with pose estimation and a triple PID for X translation, Y translation, and rotation. I’d previously tried two different approaches. One considered a line that went through the branch the driver was trying to align to and was perpendicular to the reef side and using a PID to drive to that – essentially handling the left-right (when facing the side of the reef the robot is aligning to) and rotational alignment processes. The other was using PathPlanner’s OTF (on-the-fly) pathfinding algorithms, but they were overcomplicated and not precise enough (the path-to-point command provided by PPLib explicitly states it’s imprecise, and the “pathfind to, then follow a short path” alternative that was recommended (in the docs, see ‘pathfinding’ on pathplanner.dev) was both more complicated and made unnecessary movements that induced fear of odometry drift), so we scrapped all of that and moved back to a simple three- PID system.\n\nWe’re using CTRE ’s swerve drive library (with generated code using Phoenix Tuner X) to control our swerve drive as we have the necessary hardware. It’s too late in the season to switch to another option (most likely), but that looks likely to be an off-season project. That library manages a pose estimator (meaning it handles the update() function with the odomotry). I’ve been feeding it data from our Limelight 3G whenever it’s available according to the LimelightHelpers library (using getBotPoseEstimate_wpiBlue_MegaTag2 as described in Limelight’s docs (AprilTag pipelines → Robot Localization with MegaTag2 → Using WPILib’s Pose Estimator), but replacing m_poseEstimator in the code with our drivetrain instance, as it exposes both addVisionMeasurement and setVisionMeasurementStdDevs ). We’ve made a few modifications but the main idea is still there; you can see the exact code here (function updateVisionMeasurement ); it’s being actively revised. The estimated pose is retrieved throughout the codebase with this function (which I wrote) which seems to be correct (there’s not much documentation here).\n\nI should mention that we’re also using pose estimation during the auto phase, so getting it to work well with Limelight input during tele-op would also benefit our autos drastically.\n\nWith the current code, the issue we’re noticing is that the pose estimator does not seem to incorporate vision measurements. Earlier in the season, with similar code but using the 2024 update of the CTRE library, it was clearly visible on a driver dashboard that the pose estimator was incorporating vision measurements: we’d drive the drivetrain around and the odometry would approximate the position, but the odometry isn’t perfect. Its drift would be corrected by a MegaTag2 estimate when an AprilTag became visible. Since then, it seems as if the pose estimator is ignoring vision measurements – when running an auto or spinning in place, there is no ‘jump’ in the pose estimator’s reported position that you’d expect (graphing the X/rotational components of the NT path SmartDashboard/Field/Robot). Instead, the behavior we see is consistent with the pose estimator running off of just odometry.\n\nI’ve tried setting the standard deviations to only ever be 0.7 as described in the Limelight documentation and tried setting them to be even lower values, but I don’t know what the CTRE library uses internally as it’s proprietary and native. I’ve also tried using the standard deviations from the Limelight itself. No effect.\n\nMaking our own pose estimator instead of the CTRE -managed one doesn’t seem to be an easy option, because of the native nature of the library. The raw odometry measurements aren’t very easy to access, I don’t think, but more importantly I don’t think that should be the solution. I’d like to leave that as a last resort.\n\nI tried occasionally resetting the pose estimator with a MT1 or MT2 reading, for example just before running the PIDs, but that both never quite got the desired results (the still-existent drift would render it unreliable at best; this game is quite precise) while also running contrary to how pose estimators are supposed to work. Additionally, MT1 has the drawback that it’s sometimes very wrong with no warning, and if my gyro (a Pigeon 2.0) drifts, MT2 is worse than useless, so this approach would only have ever worked 80% of the time, with a not-rare-enough chance of Very Bad results.\n\nSorry that you have to find the docs yourself; there’s a limit of two links in a post for new users.\n\nHappy to help people trying to help me.",
