The issue that we are having is basically that we can’t keep the modules synced up. They are all facing different directions, and whenever we enable and disable, or wait a few seconds, one randomly changes directions. We are using the SDS swerve libraries.\n\nWe also have 4 SRX Mag encoders, but we can’t figure out how to attach them to our Spark Max speed controllers. We tried enabling alternate encoder mode, but that didn’t seem to do anything.",

I see a note in the 1.6.0 release notes, but there isn’t much detail. All I see is that you can read index pulses from the Encoder Port when in brushed mode. In brushless mode, the encoder port has to be attached to the Neo’s encoder.\n\nMaybe some of the docs are out of date, but the Data Port documentation says in multiple places that that alternate encoder cannot read pulse index signals.\n\nThe Quadrature Encoder Input on the Data Port is compatible with standard quadrature encoder signals, usually labeled as channel A, channel B, and Index. SPARK MAX shares these signals with the Encoder Port on the output side of the controller, therefore the Index signal is shared with the third brushless encoder signal C. When in Brushless Mode, these Data Port pins cannot be used with an external encoder.\n\nAlternate Encoder Mode says\n\n† Index pulses are not currently supported",

We aren’t planning on using it this year though since it’s super new.\n\nSeems like the documentation is out of date a little (didn’t realize that in my first post). I’m sure it will get better with time. You can sorta deduce whats going on though with some different products:\n\nThis is the adapter board for the absolute encoder . It’s intended to be plug and play with the Rev Hex Bore encoder .\n\nThat would mean if you used this adapter board: Pin 1 on the JST connector would go to pin 2 on the mag encoder. Pin 2 on the JST would go to pin 9 on the mag encoder, and Pin 6 on the JST would go to pin 10 on the mag encoder.\n\nI don’t know what pin on the Spark Max is actually the PWM input, but if you search chief you may be able to figure it out.\n\nGiven the “newness” of this method, I don’t think many teams should be messing with it. It’s not well documented yet and pretty hacky.\n\n4272 will probably experiment with this in the off season to be able to run the control loop directly on the steering axis of our MK4is and maybe see a tiny performance bump. For now though, it isn’t worth it.",

So, it will be a little tricky to wire, but it seems like you’d probably want to use Gadgeteer Breakout and/or SPARK MAX Data Port Breakout so you can make the connections between the data ports. You could use the Absolute Encoder Adapter , but you’d also need a JST connector.\n\nI stand by the question for the OP: Are you sure you have SRX Mag encoders , not CANCoders ? If they are truly SRX Mag encoders, how do you have them wired?",

This doesn’t mean you can’t use the PWM output of the SRX Mag Encoder with the SPARK MAX running a NEO, you just need to make sure the A, B, and Index signals are not connected.\n\nYou can use a breakout board like our Data Port Breakout, and solder only the power, ground, and PWM signal wires to the appropriate pads on the breakout ( PWM would get connected to P6).",
