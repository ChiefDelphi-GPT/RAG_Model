We appreciate the community’s patience in making sure multiple of these issues were resolved, as we believe it will lead to a much better user experience through the rest of the season.\n\nAside from the developers below, we also wanted to give a sincere thanks to all the teams who helped test the release these past few days. These include members of 2471, 3256, 3546, 8429, 8847, 1736, and multiple others.\n\nNote that we recommend that users start off a “fresh slate” for 2025. This means you should fully reimage your coprocessor.\n\nInstallation instructions are the same as usual and can be found here.\n\nThe biggest changes since Beta 8 include:\n\nInclusion of the 2025 FRC field Apriltag layout by default\n\nInclusion of the 2025 FRC field Apriltag layout by default\n\nConvert to user selected camera matching by oh-yes-0-fps in Convert to user selected camera matching by oh-yes-0-fps · Pull Request #1556 · PhotonVision/photonvision · GitHub\n\nConvert to user selected camera matching by oh-yes-0-fps in Convert to user selected camera matching by oh-yes-0-fps · Pull Request #1556 · PhotonVision/photonvision · GitHub\n\nAdding timeSyncServer for Python by gerth2 in Adding timeSyncServer for Python by gerth2 · Pull Request #1675 · PhotonVision/photonvision · GitHub\n\nAdding timeSyncServer for Python by gerth2 in Adding timeSyncServer for Python by gerth2 · Pull Request #1675 · PhotonVision/photonvision · GitHub\n\nAdd custom RKNN model upload card by Sam948-byte in Add custom models by samfreund · Pull Request #1687 · PhotonVision/photonvision · GitHub image 1272×716 37.3 KB\n\nAdd custom RKNN model upload card by Sam948-byte in Add custom models by samfreund · Pull Request #1687 · PhotonVision/photonvision · GitHub image 1272×716 37.3 KB\n\nimage 1272×716 37.3 KB\n\nimage 1272×716 37.3 KB\n\nIngest wpilib!7609 and add turbo button by @mcm001 in Ingest wpilib!7609 and add turbo button by mcm001 · Pull Request #1662 · PhotonVision/photonvision · GitHub On Linux devices, we now report image capture timestamp , increasing latency calculation accuracy (previously under-reported by up to 2 frame times) Publishing True to /photonvision/use_new_cscore_frametime may potentially increase your camera framerate, at the cost of extra latency, on certain platforms\n\nIngest wpilib!7609 and add turbo button by @mcm001 in Ingest wpilib!7609 and add turbo button by mcm001 · Pull Request #1662 · PhotonVision/photonvision · GitHub\n\nOn Linux devices, we now report image capture timestamp , increasing latency calculation accuracy (previously under-reported by up to 2 frame times)\n\nPublishing True to /photonvision/use_new_cscore_frametime may potentially increase your camera framerate, at the cost of extra latency, on certain platforms\n\nAdd arducam model warning by Juniormunk in Add arducam model warning by Juniormunk · Pull Request #1669 · PhotonVision/photonvision · GitHub image 1274×457 165 KB\n\nAdd arducam model warning by Juniormunk in Add arducam model warning by Juniormunk · Pull Request #1669 · PhotonVision/photonvision · GitHub image 1274×457 165 KB\n\nimage 1274×457 165 KB\n\nimage 1274×457 165 KB\n\nWhat’s coming next?\n\nBug fixes will again remain top priority through the season.If you run into any issue, big or small, we’d ask for your help by:\n\nReach out on discord if you’re unsure about root cause, or need help diagnosing\n\nDocument the issue on the issues in our github.\n\nAdditionally, Providing a “just works” machine learning model for coral and algae is also very high on the list. While (again) there’s no specific timeline for delivery, there’s active work and testing happening on a 10k+ image dataset right now. Reach out on discord if you’re interested in contributing, or trying out bleeding-edge models!\n\nFinally, we still owe a few updates to our examples. In particular, NT4 has allowed each vision sample to be processed individually - getting the “latest” only is no longer a constraint. Our examples show an older way of doing this, and need to be updated to the latest recommendations.\n\nActivated CSI (ribbon cable) cameras may cause PhotonVision to crash if unplugged. As a workaround, don’t unplug active CSI cameras, or disable if not in use.\n\nCpp-examples gradle settings organization by amquake in Cpp-examples gradle settings organization by amquake · Pull
