                    "cooked": "We successfully stumped the FTA and CSAs at Central Valley Regional this weekend, and won the prize of our autonomous skipping past steps in our Playoffs matches [and completely failing as a result] until we swapped the entire driver station computer for a spare that 581 had available. Thank you Dawgs!\n\nTL;DR our no-name-brand USB-Ethernet adapter was slow to connect to FMS all weekend, and that component being bugged is the best root cause we have so far for three sequences where the Autonomous command appears to have skipped past certain steps.\n\nUsing our original driver station and a $15 “Amazon’s Finest” (it doesn’t have a brand marking) USB to Ethernet Adapter, we experience a very slow connection process to the FMS . Through Qualifications our well-tested autos ran fine, once we finally got connected.\n\nThe fun started in Match 3. OK, let’s revert code. Nope, same thing Match 8.\n\nWhen we then tested the Autonomous sequence on the practice field with a direct Ethernet link from the radio to the DS, the computer again took a very long time to connect, but then successfully played the sequence in the correct order. So, we figured it was fixed (or at least we couldn’t replicate the failure) and sent it back out. Still got nothing! This is when we escalated to event volunteers for help.\n\nPer CSAs & FTA at the event, there’s nothing in the Logs to indicate that there was an actual disconnection event that would cause the robot to skip steps on its own. No Field Fault. I’m away from the lab today, but happy to get them posted if folks are interested in poring over them.\n\nThe replacement DS that 581 lent us had a built-in Ethernet port, and connected to the FMS almost immediately. The Autonomous program ran correctly in Match 13, and we finally got to see that our shot setpoint actually did need adjustment to get to “flawless”… just in time to get eliminated and finish in 3rd.\n\nIt’s really hard to test for this in the lab, because we generally run on the high quality built-in wifi network drivers when we’re doing test sequences at home. Even tethered, the program did fine on the bad adapter. It wasn’t until FMS was in the loop that we got the truly bizarre autonomous behaviors.\n\nWe’re working on getting a Driver Station with built-in Ethernet port (presuming that the laptop hardware drivers for that built-in port will not suck) and also are trying TP-Link USB3-Ethernet adapters. Our experience on our Programmer’s Mac is that a TP-Link connects almost immediately, just like 581’s laptop did, which makes us believe ( “trust!” , the zoomerism of the day) that we should be able to use a name-brand adapter [TP-Link] at EBR even if we don’t replace the driver station laptop in time.\n\nIn the meantime, I’m kicking myself for accepting slow ds connection times, not spending $25 on TP-Link originally, and presumably never having to find this out the “fun” way. So, learn from my mistakes, get good ethernet driver components.",

Doesn’t all the computing happen on the roborio? Are ethernet packet receives just blocking for a long time, causing issues?",

I will update this thread if we can isolate it to either the adapter or the PC.\n\nAs far as I understand Pathplanner/Autobuilder, the only dependency to the driver station should be selecting the auto to build.

There is a dependency on flipping the PP path or not based on Alliance Color. We discovered that it is random when that data is available to the robot in a match and not guaranteed until autoInit . We build our paths and everything else in disabled before the match starts to save a lot of time and Alliance Color isn’t always available not matter how long you wait for it from the beginning of robotInit . That’s why the PP examples use a boolean supplier for the Alliance Color to be retrieved at “runtime” and not instantiation time.",
