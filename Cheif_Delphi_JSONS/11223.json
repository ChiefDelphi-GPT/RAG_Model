We took apart the NEO further to keep investigating and when we removed the outer shell we were able to turn the motor with a considerable amount of force. It was also making a clicking sound that was definitely not normal. after removing the core of the motor we discovered that three of the magnets had come out of position. We think that this was a quality control issue because we have not had this issue with any other NEOs even though we have run them much harder than this case. We are planning to contact REV to see if we can get it replaced. Has anyone else had a similar issue?",

But I think you learned the wrong lesson, I’ve stalled NEOs tons of times with no issues because they were stalled below the rated maximum current limit.\n\nYou can stall a NEO for the entire duration of an FRC match with no damage to the motor if you gear correctly.\n\nI would encourage you to check out REVs published locked rotator testing for more information.\n\nEdit: changed stall torque to current limit.",

Upon taking the neos apart, there were multiple dislodged magnets (unsure how many I forgot). This failure occurred on multiple Neo 1.1’s after swapping the broken one out for a new motor. We swapped to original Neo V1’s we had on hand, and didn’t see any more issues with magnets dislodging (this can be purely anecdotal considering we reduced our wrist actuation speed to try to reduce shock loads as well).\n\nIt looks like your motors aren’t being used in environments which would easily break the magnets loose. Are your motors experiencing any larger than normal vibrations over extended periods of operation? Could you share a closeup of how your Neos are mounted to the gearbox?",

They have reported that even brand new NEO 1.1 have this issue. Other users have chimed in to say they have the same issue.\n\nIt is painfully clear to me that NEO 1.1 has a serious QC issues at this point. @Greg_Needel may need to debug this soon to know how many motors are affected and prevent more faulty ones from making their way to teams.\n\nEDIT: it’s actually almost funny how good OPs design is here. Throwing the motor directly into a COTS planetary it such a good way to protect the motor, and the gear ratios themselves are very high. The arm is driven in a way that minimizes backlash too. Just a really good design.",
