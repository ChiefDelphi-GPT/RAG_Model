I want us to take apart everything we built and lay it out on the floor like the FAA does with a crashed plane. Here’s what I’m hoping to get out of it:\n\ndocument each step of disassembly, noting which places are difficult to reach due to design and any discrepancies between left side/ right side and front/ back.\n\ndocument the use of countersunk bolts where there shouldn’t be, regular nuts instead of lock nuts, etc.\n\ndocument where Max tube was installed backwards so the cut lines don’t line up.\n\ndocument where wires are too tight or too long and not properly secured.\n\ndocument any damaged pieces from competition collisions.\n\ndocument any crookedness and the source of it (mis drilled holes, mismatched parts, etc.)\n\nThis was a rebuilding year for our team- we only had one senior this year, and he was only part-time. A lot of mistakes were made during design and fabrication, but the team learned a lot from the experience. This is my fifth year as a mentor for my son’s team (ftc+frc), and while it was hard to let them fail when they ignored our advice, it was amazing to see them learn and mature from the process.\n\nHas anyone else done this? Do you have any tips or suggestions on a protocol to use?",

Let’s make sure during the packing process, at LEAST three people verify we have both colors with us.” Or sometimes, this is a severe behavioral thing - someone was talking through opening ceremonies, or on their phone when they should have been scouting.\n\nJust offering up another way to ‘look back’ that may not be as robot-specific.",

After each event we hold a retro meeting to discuss what we need to do differently for the next event or if it’s the last event of the season we plan out what to do for offseason and summer training. This includes improving the existing robot, planning for off-season events, and training younger members before the seniors vanish in a puff of smoke.\n\nThe thorns are the bad, roses are good and buds are things that we can start doing now to have more roses and less thorns the next time.\n\nDepending on how the event went you may have to come up with some stretches for the roses sometimes. The good part of it is every event had positive things happen you can point to and help boost morale.\n\nThis can be applied to robot specifics too or really any part of the team",

(and were these things within the capabilities or our team?)\n\n(2) for each of our matches, a “failure mode analysis” – what things happened that kept us from reaching our peak? some possibilities:\n\nsub-optimal match strategy,\n\nagreeing to an alliance role not well suited to us,\n\nfailures in the pre-match checklist (missing items or items missed),\n\nfailures in on-field pre-match robot prep (eg lined up wrong)\n\ncode failures (typically in auton),\n\ndrive team errors (strategic or tactical),\n\nrobot failures. – own goals (like when we drove over our own sparkmaxes), – caused by other robots\n\nIn my mind, it seems like you are mostly paying attention to just the last item (which is definitely important, but not everything)",

I want them to question their initial design decisions and see if there’s a better way, not just look at failures (of which we had plenty).\n\nSLAB-Mr.Thomas:\n\n“It’s hard for a mentor to know how hard to push to get their way.”\n\nI can’t tell if this is a dig at me for being an overzealous mentor. One of our team’s mentorship rules is that it’s the student’s bot, not ours- they will win and lose by their own choices.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, we asked the students for their priority this year- learning, or winning. Almost to a person, they chose learning.\n\nWe will offer them advice when they ask, and even offer unsolicited advice when they are making (in our opinion) a mistake, but we avoid intervening unless they’re doing something dangerous (or extremely costly).\n\nWe have tools at our disposal to help them think; e.g. asking probing and/or leading questions, for example. We’ll often ask them to explain their rationale to another student that we expect will see the issue.\n\nThe downside to this method is:\n\nwe’ll never be able to compete with “parentbots” which are common in our area.\n\nWhen students ignore input from both the other students and the mentors, it sets up the whole team for failure.\n\nThat second point bit us this year because we didn’t have any full-time seniors on our team, and the juniors weren’t comfortable stepping up and telling people no.\n\nIt cost us. Our first competition we came in 39th of 42. BUT… the team learned and grew like crazy because of it.  Conflict-averse juniors will be decisive leaders their senior year. Sophomores who made mistakes learned from their hubris and know that individuals can’t win a team game. Freshmen learned to speak up when they see bad ideas and call people out (constructively, of course).\n\nIt was painful to watch, but the team is much better for it.",

They are optimistic. Nothing will go wrong!\n\nIf you documented your early designs that were rejected, you could review to see if you missed an opportunity.\n\nThere are plenty of CD threads about adult involvement. I was alluding to my concern that one student’s lack could sabotage the team’s otherwise higher accomplishments. Adult intervention could save the day.
