                    "cooked": "In order to make the shoot more convenient, l guess that many teams in this year have used a system in code to decide when to shoot out a ball. l guess that it’s until your shooter has reached the desired speed that you make the shoot. So, my question is how do you do this in code. Since during our shooter tuning, we have an oscilliation within 20 rpm. l use an speed tolerance of 20 rpm to make sure that our shooter is around the desired speed and then l will enable the conveyor or the blocker to pass the ball to the shooter. However, l think this condition isn’t accurate enough since sometimes the condition can’t be met due to the oscilliation of the shooter. So, l am curious about how your team deals with this situation? By having an accurate shooter or by dealing with this situation in code?",

During teleop, the shooter was always running so getting up to speed only mattered when we were shooting 2 balls at a time, so we just slowed the feeder speed down until shots were consistent. It was still pretty quick. An ‘up to speed’ condition would work too, but this is one way to set it up without one and still shoot consistently.",

We used a circle fitting algorithm that feeds into our odometry system. I’ve included some links below where I talk about how it works in our build thread.\n\nThis is useful specifically if you care about full field localization, since the pose will be accurate even if the target is at an angle. If you just need the distance to the target when you’re already aimed at it, using the angle or size of the target is much simpler.\n\nFRC 6328 Mechanical Advantage 2022 Build Thread Open Alliance\n\nFRC 6328 Mechanical Advantage 2022 Build Thread Open Alliance\n\nFRC 6328 Mechanical Advantage 2022 Build Thread Open Alliance",

Can you give a more specific link? Thanks? Besides, l want to make sure that once your robot is stop at a point on the field, will the distance you get from limelight oscilliating? Besides, l see that your swerve’s max angular speed is 3 * Math.PI, will this make the driver harder to control the swerve since l think this angular speed is too big?",
