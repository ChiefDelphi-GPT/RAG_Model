                    "cooked": "Hi I’m Ashray, and I was the software captain of team 6036 from 2022 - 2024. Over the last 3 years, our all-student team built up knowledge from the ground up starting as rookies to FRC and reaching top 10 on statbotics in 2023 and division finalists in 2024. I wanted to write up a list of all the lessons and tricks we’ve learned in this journey since I’m graduating this year and maybe it could help someone out. Some of these may seem obvious since FRC documentation and practies have made huge leaps in the past few years.\n\nLog log log– rather have data and not use it than need it and not have it\n\nSometimes you can’t and/or shouldn’t “fix it in software” (Hot take?) Why add sus timings when you can add a sensor in hardware\n\nWhy add sus timings when you can add a sensor in hardware\n\nCan’t expect perfect tolerances on hardware– have calibration workflows! (The limelight might not be mounted with a milliradian of tolerance) We did this by fitting the angle constant to the data collected on distance vs reported angle to target Sometimes you need something that works not something thats “right”\n\nWe did this by fitting the angle constant to the data collected on distance vs reported angle to target Sometimes you need something that works not something thats “right”\n\nSometimes you need something that works not something thats “right”\n\nSpotless!\n\nOn-controller PID when possible (TalonFX)\n\nCAN bus overload– turn off signals that you don’t need and set some to lower update frequencies\n\nAdd a software check to make sure all setpoints are within tolerance before taking a shot (eg flywheel velocity)\n\nDon’t upload code after practice day , if you do– track it Have an autochooser instead of deploying every time\n\nHave an autochooser instead of deploying every time\n\nUse continous integration (even just a build workflow)– we use CircleCI\n\nGithub issues and pull requests (PR) are awesome Every single change should have an associated issue and PR Always have someone review and test code on robot before a merge– the main branch should always be something that can be deployed and work\n\nEvery single change should have an associated issue and PR\n\nAlways have someone review and test code on robot before a merge– the main branch should always be something that can be deployed and work\n\nNEVER worth doing something that could be unreliable\n\nRead libraries (eg CTRE Phoenix, even WPILib) inside out to understand how they work\n\nRewrite instead of bandaid (if you can understand the code when you need to fix it at competition in 30 seconds, this helps)\n\nDon’t waste time optimizing an intermediate – some more vision FPS probably won’t affect how many points your robot is putting up Measure how changes actually affect performance\n\nMeasure how changes actually affect performance\n\nSometimes its worth it to try a crazy idea– but ONLY after you get the bot moving since your duty is to your team first (more on this at bottom)\n\nTurns out open source has a ton of bugs– your job to read it\n\nWith even simple simulation software can get a majority of the work done before even design is done We had code for mechanisms like a pink arm or a tilted elevator ready week 1 and then DJ arm week 2/3 Also severely reduces the chances of damaging the robot leading to horrible delays\n\nWe had code for mechanisms like a pink arm or a tilted elevator ready week 1 and then DJ arm week 2/3\n\nAlso severely reduces the chances of damaging the robot leading to horrible delays\n\n“Experts” on CD are not always right– do the real research\n\nJust because its a solved problem doesn’t mean you can’t solve it better Extension: just because there’s a “normal way to do it” doesn’t mean something simpler can’t work better. Our auto-align was just a P and a D, no fancy trajectory generation or profiling yet it could place pieces consistently faster than any human with some auto arm timing software.\n\nExtension: just because there’s a “normal way to do it” doesn’t mean something simpler can’t work better. Our auto-align was just a P and a D, no fancy trajectory generation or profiling yet it could place pieces consistently faster than any human with some auto arm timing software.\n\nVisualVM everything (CPU profiler) We run this every few days to make sure no new changes have indirectly broken/degraded other things Side conclusion: don’t have print statements in production code\n\nWe run this every few days to make sure no new changes have indirectly broken/degraded other things\n\nSide conclusion: don’t have print statements in production code\n\nThreading is your friend (we ran our odom on a separate loop)\n\nDon’t write while loops without a counter-based cutoff\n\nConfiguring hardware returns status codes– use them for things such as to reapplying configs if needed or a pit auto-check!\n\nThe main on-rio robot code isn’t the only code This includes managing and reviewing code running on coprocessors Tracking versions of EVERYTHING (hardware firmware, linux versions, library versions)\n\nThis includes managing and reviewing code running on coprocessors\n\nTracking versions of EVERYTHING (hardware firmware, linux versions, library versions)\n\nSoftware has domain expert knowledge on more than just code– this includes TELLING design the exact camera positions we want or what sensors we need and where we need them. This means software students should gain a good understanding of hardware and the limitations and capability of design\n\nThis means software students should gain a good understanding of hardware and the limitations and capability of design\n\nA slower bring-up of software is always worth it to keep robot hardware safe This can mean subsystem by subsystem or even method by method (more in tricks)\n\nThis can mean subsystem by subsystem or even method by method (more in tricks)\n\n(Extention of 2023)– due to use of simulation we were able to running full turreted auto-aiming teleop cycles within 6 hours of the build handoff (mostly just tuning)\n\nInternal software to replace open source is HARD– only worth it if you can seriously continously maintain them to be more powerful or better integrated with your stack than the amazing open source projects such as Choreo or PhotonVision We opted to write a custom trajopt app for our paths and custom vision software for apriltags this year (more in our tech binder)\n\nWe opted to write a custom trajopt app for our paths and custom vision software for apriltags this year (more in our tech binder)\n\nUse software to do things software is good at – instead of doing tuned timings, use sensors and conditionals. The real world is unpredictable so sensors are your friend. Why look at the forest and walk through with your eyes closed when you can just keep them open? This was a large focus of ours to get the “pickup aim shoot pickup …” 4-speaker-cycle extremely fast\n\nThis was a large focus of ours to get the “pickup aim shoot pickup …” 4-speaker-cycle extremely fast\n\nThe field isn’t perfect. Plan for it Why would you aim for the tiny slot which is the speaker using tags on the stage behind you\n\nWhy would you aim for the tiny slot which is the speaker using tags on the stage behind you\n\nWrite software such that the robot can’t get stuck in an unrecoverable state (even just a reset button)\n\nYou can set brownout voltage if you really need to (7.0 → 6.0)\n\nAlways clamp a value before sending a command to the motor even if “I swear I did the math right” Can also add software limits and even hardware limit switches\n\nCan also add software limits and even hardware limit switches\n\nIn the initial bring-up phase you can even just graph the output and not send the command to the hardware while moving the mechanisms around by hand to test for unwanted behavior\n\nAlso solve things like aiming parameters for dt ahead and then use that for feedforwards\n\nRegenerative braking exists! Use it for things like spinning up shooter\n\nMake software people learn electrical! Also look through the circuits unit of AP Physics\n\nTest new firmwares asap since they can fix a lot of problems (eg the kraken talonfx update in march stopping them from overheating)\n\nYou don’t need to do things exactly how “they did it” We ran stress tests on our coprocessors to determine the need for different types of heatsinks and active cooling We replaced camera lenses we didn’t like\n\nWe ran stress tests on our coprocessors to determine the need for different types of heatsinks and active cooling\n\nWe replaced camera lenses we didn’t like\n\nIn 2023, we decided to run our arm to follow trajectories that we generated using numerical optimization solvers. But many teams made it work with simple PID ? Actually the initial version to get to a working state of our robot just used simple PID and motion profiles.\n\nThen in order to hyper-optimize our placement time to be faster than linear mechanisms such as elevators, we decided to innovate further.\n\nBasically a new feature shouldn’t lead to the possibility of not having complete robot code and it should truly have a viable competitive advantage . This was one of the first-ever uses of trajopt in FRC making it a “crazy idea” but since it made cycle 2-3 seconds fast and we did 10+ cycles every match, it was worth it.\n\nIf we instead spent that time getting our vision from 25 to 50 fps we probably wouldn’t have gotten measurable end-goal benefit out of it.\n\nA ton of work often beats a lot of experience– don’t be afraid to take a shot or set your goals too high\n\nAlways push the boundaries because turns out thats where the actual competition is\n\nKnowing if/when to do something is harder and usually more important than knowing how to do it",

Manual checks– we just do a quick run on the ground before rolling out to a match.\n\nEmilio:\n\nCan you explain how you implemented this?\n\nI used casadi+python with the lagrangian derivation of double-jointed arm dynamics and some dc motor equations from 971 tech talks with the constants for falcons in them. I’ll probably be cleaning 2023 code up for a release soon but in the meantime I found out that 6328’s method in 2023 was extremely similar we just did some extra things for motions like the “place-down”\n\nEmilio:\n\nSomething a little less specific: What’s your favorite line of code you’ve written on the team?\n\nI love this question and I might know the answer:",
