                    "cooked": "QFRCDashboard is officially ready for the 2025 season !\n\nQFRCDashboard is an extremely lightweight, high-performance dashboard, designed to be aesthetically pleasing & easy to look at during a match, all while taking up as few driver station resources as possible.\n\nimage 1001×650 71.7 KB\n\nimage 1001×650 71.7 KB\n\nQFRCDashboard utilizes the very high efficiency & low resource cost of the Qt framework and its QML GUI to ensure that as many resources can be allocated to the driver station app as possible. Additionally, widget & network updates are done as-needed, not constantly or periodically.\n\nOn average, QFRCDashboard uses up less than 150MB of RAM, and virtually no CPU ! By comparison, Shuffleboard uses up around 600MB of RAM, and up to 30% of the CPU on certain older systems, if not the entire CPU! Under significant load, the difference is even more pronounced, where Shuffleboard can easily climb up to 1GB or more while QFRCDashboard remains under 200MB .\n\nIn addition to basic data structures & displays, QFRCDashboard also contains several additional widgets to help display more information to the driver:\n\nField display with customizable robot look & vertical display\n\nBoolean (true/false) widget with custom shapes\n\nEnum (preset string values) widget with custom shapes & configurable colors based on a string value\n\nQFRCDashboard contains QFRCLib, a one-file library that can interact with the dashboard in several ways:\n\nSelect tabs\n\nSend notifications\n\nSend alerts & errors\n\nQFRCDashboard’s UI takes inspiration from a variety of well-known themes, including Windows 7 Aero and Windows 10 Flat, and combines it with some unique design aspects to create an aesthetic experience that complements QFRCDashboard’s excellent usability.\n\nQFRCDashboard is designed to be dead-simple for programmers, drivers, and total strangers alike to use. Like Shuffleboard, widgets can be dragged in from a side menu, easily configured or deleted via a right-click menu, and dragged & resized via the mouse. Configuration dialogs have additionally been designed to be easy to understand & use.\n\nQFRCDashboard will automatically open your last-opened layout file on launch, can easily and quickly open up any alternate layouts, and can even download layouts deployed to your robot!\n\nIn a future release, QFRCDashboard will additionally support pushing layouts directly to the robot, but due to WPILib limitations, this isn’t currently possible.\n\nFor guidance on installation, usage, and the many additional features present in QFRCDashboard, see its wiki !\n\nFor feedback, suggestions, bugs, or any issues or questions you may have, place them here, or on the issues tab on GitHub.\n\nI appreciate you reading this post and showing interest in QFRCDashboard. I hope to see plenty of people use it during the season and hope to improve upon your dashboard experience!\n\nQFRCDashboard has received dramatic changes since last season, and if you used QFRCDashboard in 2024, I encourage you to catch up by looking at the development threads since the initial 2024 release.\n\nQFRCDashboard 2024-25 Technical Discussion\n\nQFRCDashboard 2025 Beta - a Shuffleboard alternative Programming\n\nIndeed, since 2024, QFRCDashboard has been completely rewritten and expanded; new features have been added, the UI was totally redesigned, and the experience was dramatically improved.\n\nFull Changelogs:\n\nTotal UI redesign\n\nNew & improved widget configuration dialogs\n\nDramatically improved performance & resource usage\n\nRemoved Graph & Swerve widgets\n\nImproved several widgets: Field2d Added shape configuration, vertical display, and red/blue alliance flipping CameraView Added quality, resolution, and framerate configuration\n\nField2d Added shape configuration, vertical display, and red/blue alliance flipping\n\nAdded shape configuration, vertical display, and red/blue alliance flipping\n\nCameraView Added quality, resolution, and framerate configuration\n\nAdded quality, resolution, and framerate configuration\n\nFixed dozens of potential crashes\n\nTrue theming support\n\nDramatically improved theming, & support for custom accents\n\nLots of UI fixes\n\nPlatform consistency\n\nNotification support via QFRCLib\n\nTab-switching support\n\nRemote layout support\n\nTotally redesigned widget configuration UI\n\nTotally redesigned UIs for tab management, settings, and more\n\nSmall UI inconsistencies have been fixed\n\nUI elements now scale depending on your screen size\n\nDramatically reduced build time",

This has been fixed.\n\nLinux ARM builds are now available! WIndows ARM builds will be added in the future.\n\nmacOS builds can now run on both Intel (AMD64) and Apple Silicon (ARM64) Macs.\n\nFull Changelog : Comparing 2025.0.1...2025.1.0 · Q-FRC/Dashboard · GitHub",

You can now click on any of the triangles and the corresponding value will be toggled. These values can be retrieved via SmartDashboard.getBooleanArray() .\n\nWhen the local and remote values don’t match for editable text and number widgets, the boxes will outline in red until the values match. The string chooser will receive this in the next update.\n\nFull Changelog : Comparing 2025.1.1...2025.2.0 · Q-FRC/Dashboard · GitHub",

Bug fixes will still come as needed, but the UI and features are effectively final for the remainder of the 2025 season.\n\nDrag & Drop and Mouse Resize had performance issues when dealing with larger tabs, often using a full CPU core during large resize operations. Now, resizing never uses up more than 0.2% of the CPU.\n\nReduced memory usage for certain widgets.\n\nThe title bar buttons and widget title fields overlapped with the resize anchors, making resizing the window or widgets in those areas difficult.\n\nmacOS builds would fail to run due to signing issues, Now, you still have to allow the app to run in Security & Privacy, but the app should now run on most, if not all, macOS systems without additional steps or dialogs.\n\nThe UI Theme was switched from the Universal theme to the Material theme.\n\nAdditionally, the menu bar is now integrated into the custom decoration. Note that due to implementation issues and crashes, the native macOS menu bar has been temporarily removed.\n\nA Text Display widget has been added. This behaves identically to the number displays.\n\nThe number and text displays now have an additional color option.\n\nYou can now click on the GitHub link on the About dialog to open it in your browser.\n\nTo reduce UI clutter, spin boxes no longer have step up/down buttons.\n\nCompletely refactored the drag & drop system.\n\nFull Changelog : Comparing 2025.2.1...2025.2.2 · Q-FRC/Dashboard · GitHub",
