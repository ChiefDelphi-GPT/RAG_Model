We’re facing a dilemma and would greatly appreciate insights into the differences between these options and how crucial these disparities might be.\n\nWith Falcons seemingly unavailable for the foreseeable future, we’ve started exploring the possibility of adopting a Neo swerve instead. Our primary quest is to understand the magnitude of differences between the two and their potential impact on our robot’s performance.\n\nSpecifically, we’re curious about:\n\nPerformance (Power and Speed): How do Neo motors in a swerve configuration compare in terms of power and speed against Falcons with the same gear ratios? How much the difference is noticeable and impactful, and are there ways to minimize these losses?\n\nPerformance (Power and Speed): How do Neo motors in a swerve configuration compare in terms of power and speed against Falcons with the same gear ratios?

For 99% of the teams out there, any of the large brushless motors is going to give you the power and speed you need.\n\nTeams have been plenty successful with both, so while there are differences they are fairly equivalent.\n\nCompatibility really comes down to what else you’re using.  If you go with MAXSwerve, for example, Neo’s are best.  MK4’s were generally done with Falcons, but it’s not impossible to go the other way around either.\n\nThat generally comes down to the swerve module, not the motor, and what is supports.  Pick your module and look at what software resources are available for it!\n\nI don’t think anyone can really answer this.  Aside from developing a comfort level with one vendors software API, I don’t think there’s much that prevents teams from deciding to switch as equipment wears out.\n\nIn short, focus first on your swerve module choice, and let that choice guide you to the best motor for that module.",

No motor issue, but the controller stopped talking on CAN altogether.\n\nWe had no NEO failures, but it was just one competition.\n\nWe’ve found CTRE devices to be very chatty on the CAN bus. We will always use a CANivore for CTRE devices for this reason.\n\nFor next year, we’re looking at using Krakens for drive, Falcons (v2) for turn, and Cancoders, all on a separate CAN bus via CANivore and then we’ll use NEOs for mechanisms.  We think it may be somewhat of a competitive advantage over running NEOs, but not sure how much actually.\n\nEdit: we used SDS Mk4i modules for both robots above.",

As of this moment (this opinions is solely based upon programming knowledge of both) I would argue that CTRE’s environment is better ONLY because of their ability to estimate current positions of motors while taking into account the delay in communication alongside the faster speeds you can get with a CANivore (however REV might release something equivalent this year). Their Swerve Template takes full advantage of their suite and it seems like they built hardware features because they noticed deficiencies while programming their own swerve drive template. They have made their API significantly easier to use with the latest releases as well. CTRE’s template is moving towards a library format where you send in SwerveRequests and it will set the drivetrain accordingly. Giving you alot of control over it while keeping code low.\n\nWITH THAT SAID.\n\nREV hardware is easier to acquire and you are more likely to be able to replace any component that has inexplicably broke mid-tournament. REV hardware like SparkMAX’s CAN have a faster feedback loop by using the throughbore or other encoder which attaches directly to the SparkMAX expansion board. MOST things you can do with a CTRE environment you can do with a REV environment HOWEVER somethings are much more difficult to implement and user implementations would defeat the purpose of their existence (like the encoder latency compensation). REV also has a nice template but it doesn’t do as much or take into account as much as CTRE’s does.\n\nTo sum it up your best answer you can get is “it depends”",
