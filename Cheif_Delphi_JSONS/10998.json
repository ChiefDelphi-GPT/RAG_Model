If there is one, I would be glad to read it.\n\nI appreciate 3847 Spectrum’s inclusion of failures & fixes in their competition debriefs that are part of their excellent built blog . It inspired me to start this discussion to crowdsource a list of the really common avoidable failures and how to avoid them.\n\nWe had a great season this year, improving in many ways over last, and we’re proud of our efforts and results. That said, we have a lot to learn. In particular, there are common failures we encountered that were avoidable… I’ll share a couple of them:\n\n1. Failure: Our robot became disabled because its network switch’s barrel power connector came unplugged. How to Avoid: Hot glue the barrel power connector so it cannot come unplugged. (Thanks to our alliance partner for this advice… 4469 R.A.I.D. I believe)\n\n2. Failure: We observed many robots driving around at times with mechanisms outside their bumpers (our team included), and in one case an opposing alliance robot became disabled & a red card elims loss resulted. How to Avoid: It seems like design & programming foresight + drive team training to deliberately avoid this are the ways to address this one. Our team did talk about this, but we still were not always as careful as we should have been.\n\nWhat would you put on the list of avoidable common failures? I hate seeing robots disabled; let’s help each other avoid some of these!",

Additionally you should retain them via screws or a bearing hat to ensure that the bearings don’t pop out of the plates.\n\nIntake pnuematic placement: many teams design pnuematic intake linkages so the cylinder is extended when the intake is extended. While this works, this does mean that the cylinder is in its most vulnerable configuration when the intake is most likely to get hit. If you can, design it so your cylinder is retracted when the intake is extended.\n\nUse inserts to reinforce printed hex bores: if you 3D print things like gears or pulleys or other things that transmit torque via a printed hex bore, consider using a 3D print insert to reinforce the hex bore to prevent it from rounding over. WCP and TTB sell these now, and some teams even buy 3/4\" hex spacer from McMaster.\n\nHave a long Ethernet cable (preferably spooled): when practicing at home you’ll likely be running your robot wirelessly however at competitions you’ll want a long Ethernet cable when practicing on the practice field.\n\nSystem checks: before and after every match perform a systems check of all robot functions. This can help catch issues before you see them during a match. Sometimes you can address them, other times you don’t but you’ll be able to adjust your match strategy as necessary.\n\nRobot maintaince: perform regular robot maintaince through competitions. Things can and will loosen up over time even with nyclock nuts or loctite. Things like tread wear out over time and gears need to be re-greased occasionally. Check for carpet strands caught in your drivetrain.\n\nTake care of your batteries: Don’t carry them by the wires! Keep them on the charger and always use a battery beak before stuffing a battery into your robot.\n\nPacking list: When packing for a competition, have a plan! Come up with a packing list to help you stay organized. If you forget something, make sure to add it to the packing list for next time.",

I’ve known them to internally fail causing intermittent data loss (which can manifest as just a little packet loss when physically disturbed, or full comms loss) since 2018, and nothing seems to have changed. The issue seems to be entirely with the data (Ethernet pass-through) portion of the cable; they do a good job of keeping the radio on.\n\nOn the flip side, their radio power module is so reliable I failed to diagnose a (brief) full battery short a team was seeing during collisions for most of an event because the only power failure I had evidence of was to the RIO. Probably over a dozen battery shorts, and their radio didn’t drop connection to the FMS once. Rather impressive.\n\nmarshall:\n\nLoose main power wires?\n\nOnly my second year as a CSA , but I saw this more this year than any other I recall - including on my own team. No idea if there’s any particular reason for this.",

The problem was more that the buckle we had on the crossing strap kept failing repeatedly. We replaced that strap system with long inverted 1/4” bolts and a thick retaining bar with through holes drilled into it. Then we use thumbscrews to tighten it down (similar to our bumper mounting/retaining system.) No more loose batteries. We had one team at the PCH CMP learn the same lesson as us and they implemented a similar solution at the event.\n\nRobots work better with the battery still inside them.",
