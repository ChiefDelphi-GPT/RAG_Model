There’s nothing I can upload to prove that I volunteer that Autodesk will accept. I’ve tried the team roster (with my name) and they denied it.\n\nI use my old university email since I started the team when I was at my university. I also have a personal email that has also expired\n\nIt used to be so easy to get an educational license, now it’s incredibly hard.\n\nWhat can I do? Ive emailed @inventor_phild twice within the past 3 months. Does he even work for Autodesk anymore? Is there a new contact or a FIRST representative?\n\nThanks in advance. We have some projects we need to use Fusion for and this is holding us up",

From what I read on CD, some mentors who are not employed by an educational institution have had success registering and some have been rejected.  I think there are also cases where a mentor who had an educational account, but was never employed by an educational institution cannot renew that educational account when Autodesk requires renewal.\n\nI am one of the lucky mentors not employed by a school who got an Autodesk educational account when it was apparently a much easier process and that account is still working.  I dread the day that I try to launch Fusion 360 and I find that my education account is locked out with no way to renew.  If this were to happen during build season, it would be a huge disruption. It seems like it may only be a matter of time given Autodesk’s current policies.",

I don’t know who the new contact/rep is–they’ve got massive shoes to fill.\n\nI suggest going through the Team Advocate at HQ–the message they need to pass along is that team members/mentors don’t all have school IDs so Autodesk needs to find a way to allow mentors associated with the teams using their products to log in, or they’ll see a mass exodus.",
