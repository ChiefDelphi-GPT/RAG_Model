                    "cooked": "As our team continues to mature and utilize logging more, we are looking at logging the execution of all of Command s.  We believe this will help give us insight into determining what’s happening, when, and why.\n\nIn fact, for Crescendo, we already did this somewhat by adding logging commands in sequence with the Command s that we wanted to trace, mostly in our autonomous routine commands.  However, this muddies up the code, and we are looking for a way to do this cleanly, automatically, and consistently.\n\nLast night we tested using CommandScheduler.onCommandInitialize and the liked to log commands.  We really like how this allowed up to clean up our code.  However, our testing helped us realize that such callbacks only allow us to log the commands that are actually going through the CommandScheduler ; composed commands in parallel and sequential command groups won’t be logged with that approach.  That doesn’t suffice for us, because we really want to be able to see the execution of pieces of our auto routines, for example.\n\nWe thought about extending Command to something like LoggedCommand , and using that in place of Command everywhere.  Such a class would “self-log”, and we’d be able to see the full picture of what’s executing, regardless of how it is being triggered.  However, we might also need to extend methods like alongWith , andThen and deadlineWith to produce LoggedCommand s, and moreover replicate/wrap the functionality of the various Commands factories, lest they product unlogged commands.\n\nI expect we are not the the only team that would like this implicit logging of Command scheduling/execution.  Are there any other approaches that teams have used successfully, or maybe existing reference implementations of such logging?",

This poses a problem for both visualization (e.g. showing what commands are running in a useful way, particularly showing the current state within a more complex command sequence) and logging (it’s not terribly informative to just use the class name or a class instance reference/pointer).  We’d love to have this as a standard feature but haven’t figured out a good way to make it useful without requiring people provide string names everywhere (including when calling decorators), which gets incredibly annoying very quickly.  Java doesn’t provide a mechanism to e.g. get callsite line and column for method calls (it’s possible to get line numbers with some work, but not column numbers, which is important for method chaining).",

Continuations allow for call stacks to be saved to the heap and resumed later.  **This cannot run on the roborio due to continuations not being implemented for 32-bit ARM platforms in OpenJDK.** The 2027 MRC will use a CPU with a 64-bit ARM, RISCV, or x86 architecture, all of which are supported by continuations.\n\nThe async framework allows command bodies to be written in an imperative style:\n\n```java\nRequireableResource drivetrain = new Drivetrain();\n\nCommand driveTenFeet =\n  drivetrain.run(coroutine -> {\n    drivetrain.resetEncoders();\n    while (drivetrain.getDistance() < 10) {\n      coroutine.yield(); // <- note the yield call!\n      drivetrain.tankDrive(1, 1);\n    }\n    drivetrain.stop();\n  }).named(\"Drive Ten Feet\");\n```\n\nWhich would look something like this using the current functional framework:\n\n```java\nSubsystem drivetrain = new Drivetrain();\n\nComand driveTenFeet =\n  drivetrain.runOnce(drivetrain::resetEncoders)\n    .andThen(driveTrain.run(() -> drivetrain.tankDrive(1, 1))\n    .until(() -> drivetrain.getDistance() < 10)\n    .finallyDo(drivetrain::stop)\n    .withName(\"Drive Ten Feet\");\n```\n\nCommands could be written as thin wrappers around regular imperative methods:\n\n```java\nclass Drivetrain extends HardwareResource {\n  void driveDistance(Coroutine coroutine, Measure<Distance> distance) {\n    encoders.reset();\n    while (getDistance().lt(distance)) {\n      coroutine.yield();\n      tankDrive(1, 1);\n    }\n    stop();\n  }\n\n  Command driveDistanceCommand(Measure<Distance> distance) {\n    return run(coroutine -> driveDistance(coroutine, distance)).named(\"Drive \" + distance.toLongString());\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHowever, an async command *will* need to be *actively* cooperative and periodically call `Coroutine.yield()` in loops to yield control back to the command scheduler to let it process other commands.\n\nThere are also some other additions like priority levels (as opposed to a blanket yes/no for ignoring incoming commands), factories requiring names be provided for commands, and the scheduler tracking all running commands and not just the highest-level groups. However, those changes aren't unique to an async framework, and could just as easily be used in a traditional command framework.\n\nLinks:\n[JEP 425 - Virtual Threads](https://openjdk.org/jeps/425)\n[JEP 453 - Structured Concurrency](https://openjdk.org/jeps/453)\n[The async version of the rapid react example project](https://github.com/SamCarlberg/allwpilib/tree/better-async-commands/wpilibjExamples/src/main/java/edu/wpi/first/wpilibj/examples/coroutines)\n[Scheduler.java](https://github.com/SamCarlberg/allwpilib/blob/better-async-commands/commandsv3/src/main/java/edu/wpi/first/wpilibj/commandsv3/Scheduler.java)\n[ParallelGroup.java](https://github.com/SamCarlberg/allwpilib/blob/better-async-commands/commandsv3/src/main/java/edu/wpi/first/wpilibj/commandsv3/ParallelGroup.java)\n[Sequence.java](https://github.com/SamCarlberg/allwpilib/blob/better-async-commands/commandsv3/src/main/java/edu/wpi/first/wpilibj/commandsv3/Sequence.java)",

Getting the last 20% is painful.\n\nIf you want to begin to explore using triggers to disjoint a sequence you are invited to jump into Group Disjoint Test . It’s not a tutorial but shows how to run a long sequence of commands disjointed by either proxy or triggers.

There’s no way to force users to do this, nor to really do it with reflection, but that’s…not an uncommon amount of inconvenience for a Java API.",
