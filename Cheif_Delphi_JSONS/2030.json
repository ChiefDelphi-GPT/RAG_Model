I’ve been exploring ways to improve our CAN setup, and so far, we’ve decided to use two CANivores to separate our drivetrain and superstructure CAN , allowing us to keep our drivetrain functional and play defense in the event of a failure.\n\nI was thinking about how we could implement even more redundancy, and it dawned on me that Star topology might be the answer. My idea was to have the 2 separate CANivore buses, keeping the drivetrain daisy-chained while adding a hub to the superstructure bus to implement Star topology.\n\nI know there are many merits to Star topology, but I also know that there are risks that come with improperly setting it up. That’s why I wanted to get any advice on how it works for your team, if it’s even worth setting up, tips on how to make a proper Star bus, any other topologies you’d recommend, and even reasons not to use it.\n\nI greatly appreciate any advice and information you can give. Thanks in advance.",

This is more of a programming requirement, since depending on how you utilize the CTRE control functionality, it can be a pretty heavy load on the standard CAN 2.0 network. In general, you can’t really use Star/Bus Topology on the CAN FD network (we got it working to a limited degree with <10 devices on a short run one time, but it was temperamental to say the least.\n\nFor the last few years our standard procedure is to wire the drivetrain motors/sensors and any other static CTRE components on the chassis using the CANivore/ CAN FD network in daisy chain; since these devices are in the most protected spots, the risk of accidental disconnects taking down the drivetrain is generally low. For everything else (Non- CTRE , above the chassis, moving components, etc.), we run on the RIO/ CAN 2.0 on Star/Bus using some simple custom distribution hubs we’ve developed over the years…\n\nkdp7UdZ 1250×552 56.7 KB\n\nkdp7UdZ 1250×552 56.7 KB\n\nkdp7UdZ 1250×552 56.7 KB\n\nTo my knowledge, using this setup we have had zero CAN issues during matches in the last 2 years (we had one repeat issue in 2023 with a CANCoder that refused to stay soldered, but that was about it).",

Star offers a lot of redundancy (since a single failure won’t take down the whole network, generally), especially when moving parts are involved. The drivetrain is also the biggest drain on CAN network utilization, so once you separate that out, you can pretty much run everything else on CAN 2.0 with no issues.\n\nIn general, my preference would be to run everything on Star, if it weren’t for the limited bandwidth of the 2.0 network. Running both is more of a compromise solution than anything, but it’s good enough if you’re smart about it. A team without a high CAN bus utilization on 2.0 could probably use Star for the whole robot with no issues, we are just not one of those teams.\n\nThe Playing with Fusion boards are pretty similar to ours, so you’d probably be fine going that way. Swyft also has an interesting solution for Daisy Chain CAN and power, though I don’t know how much I trust RJ45 connectors.",

The reason separating the drive motors on a swerve from the 2.0 network helps so much is how the CTRE environment communicates between swerve motors and sensors, but individual motors running their own PIDs and functions don’t cause as much of a draw on the network (at least that’s how I understand it, not a programmer).\n\nIf you’re having issues running more than 4x standalone Krakens on the 2.0 network, I would suggest reaching out to CTRE ’s support (they’re very helpful), as you might be doing something wrong.",

We used a combined shielded high/low signal wire so it was robust and each swerve module and other subsystem got it’s own CAN run. Not a single failure or outage the whole season, compared to seemingly every other match the year before (we took the upgrade seriously.) Highly recommend. All our connections to the device plug in to green/yellow cables were done with combined crimp/heat shrink connectors.",

And yeah, that added (maybe) another potential failure point with the USB connections to the roborio.\n\nBetter advice - we pretty much exclusively use Krakens and CANcoders and build our own CAN segments between devices - cut to length and crimped in house so we have next to zero solder connections (except on the CANcoders and terminating resistors) and zero other connections such as molex. We also use the jacketed wire where things are potentially prone to being cut, but we all generally hate trying to cut thru that jacket without nicking the green/yellow wires…",

                    "cooked": "There some people here making claims “our star works great” without supporting that with what bus they are running.  That is critical. CTRE ’s can implementation doesn’t require daisy chain although it’s strongly recommended.  It is far more sensitive to star “abuse” than the rio’s native and slower can.\n\nWe used the canivore, and used a hybrid topology.  This is what it looked like:\n\n20250729_151749 1920×796 75.4 KB\n\n20250729_151749 1920×796 75.4 KB\n\n20250729_151749 1920×796 75.4 KB\n\nThe small squares are what I’ll call a “hub”.  It’s where we broke out the star from the trunk line.\n\nWe DID have problems with the can bus on initial setup.  We kept stub lengths as short as possible.  What we found, however, was that when we had two stubs close together, say the intake and a swerve module, and the “linear” distance if you measured back to the canivore along the wires overlapped, we would have problems.  This was not surprising.  As a result, when we had an issue like that, we would extend the wires between the hubs.\n\nThis is a picture of what I mean: 20250729_151754 1920×1415 116 KB\n\n20250729_151754 1920×1415 116 KB\n\n20250729_151754 1920×1415 116 KB\n\nOn the right in the above diagram, the Intake “star” is long enough that it’s length back to the canivore overlaps with a device on the swerve “star”.  The fix to this was to extend the cable between the intake and swerve so the devices are a significantly different ‘wire’ distance from the canivore as those on another star.\n\nFollowing that worked.  However…\n\nTake this all with a giant grain of salt.  It took us a couple tries to get the lengths correct as we worked through the bus.  And I was worried about the ‘what if it fails’ all season.  At one point, we made a minor change to one of the stars during practice and it took the bus down until we lengthened another cable.  It can be tricky, and you can spend a lot of time diagnosing a problem that you really shouldn’t be wasting time on.\n\nDaisy chaining is the simple, reliable answer to the question “how should I run my can bus wiring?”.  Just ask yourself “Do I want to be programming the robot, or troubleshooting my can bus?”",

Either topology, poorly implemented will perform poorly.\n\nBy focusing your energies on improving the procedures used when making electrical connections will improve the overall reliability of your whole control system and your robot.\n\nEnsure that your team members do a tug-test on each individual wire (not wire pair) immediately after making the connection.\n\nEnsure that connectors cannot come apart. Use a small zip-tie to secure the black “ PWM ” connectors supplied with SparkMax’s.\n\nEnsure that wires are strain relieved on both sides of a set of connectors to prevent tension from being applied to the connections when the wires move.\n\nEnsure that there is never any tension on wires, especially at connection points. It is best to include a “service loop” consisting of an extra 1/2\" to 1\" of wire at each connection point. This allows movement in the wires without transferring force into the connection points. It also allows easier servicing of the connections.\n\nThe practices I described are commonly used in industry.",

Obviously, poor wiring standards will cause issues no matter what topology you use, but even with perfect wiring a star topology can still have issues with ringing, reflections, etc. that a standards-compliant daisy chain topology will not have.\n\nTom_Line:\n\nDaisy chaining is the simple, reliable answer to the question “how should I run my can bus wiring?”. Just ask yourself “Do I want to be programming the robot, or troubleshooting my can bus?”\n\nThis is what it comes down to for me. Even with the roboRIO native CAN2.0 bus, I’d rather take the extra time and effort to make a daisy-chain bus and take extra precautions to protect the wiring than take the risk that a device change or rewiring or hot-swap will take down the whole bus and leave hours of troubleshooting to figure out.",
