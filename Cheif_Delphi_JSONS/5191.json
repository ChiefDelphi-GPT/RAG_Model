This is also my first post on cd so apologies if the format is a little bit funky.\n\nFRCMonkey is your team’s ultimate tool for growing your software knowledge. It’s designed to make learning FRC programming concepts easier, more interactive, and more accessible for teams of all skill levels.\n\nConcept Overviews : FRCMonkey offers concise, beginner-friendly overviews of key concepts essential for FRC teams, including: Java : Learn the basics of Java, one of the most popular programming languages used in FRC . Git : Understand version control for managing code and collaborating with your team. WPILib : Explore the library used to control your robot and make it competition-ready.\n\nJava : Learn the basics of Java, one of the most popular programming languages used in FRC .\n\nGit : Understand version control for managing code and collaborating with your team.\n\nWPILib : Explore the library used to control your robot and make it competition-ready.\n\nInteractive Walkthroughs : Dive into programming walkthroughs that guide you step-by-step through key FRC programming concepts, such as motor control. These walkthroughs are done directly in your browser, eliminating the need for external IDEs or setup. You can write, test, and see your code come to life in real-time using the built-in simulator.\n\nThese walkthroughs are done directly in your browser, eliminating the need for external IDEs or setup.\n\nYou can write, test, and see your code come to life in real-time using the built-in simulator.\n\nRight now, FRCMonkey includes a walkthrough and simulation for running a motor . Future planned simulations include:\n\nControlling Multiple Motors\n\nUsing Sensors\n\nVision Systems\n\nMore!\n\nStay tuned for these and more!\n\nThis projects is still in its early stages of development.\n\nThis means there are probably a LOT of issues to address and many features missing. Two big features I wasn’t able to implement yet are:\n\nSyntax Highlighting\n\nA Glossary (Definitions/Explanations for all the currently bolded terms and some more)\n\nI’m sharing this project now(with all its flaws) because\n\nI want to gauge interest before further development\n\nI won’t be able to continue working on it until the 2025 FRC season comes along, where it will likely be lost in the annual barrage of cd posts.\n\nYour feedback and feature requests are incredibly valuable! I’ll do my best to implement them as the project evolves.\n\nSupport for more programming languages\n\nBetter visualisations for all simulations\n\nMore beginner friendly (definitions EVERYWHERE)\n\nA deeper dive into critical concepts (Programming basics, Git, WPILib, Vision, Hardware, etc.)\n\nimage 3820×1923 86.7 KB image 1900×1372 26 KB image 1869×1240 23.5 KB\n\nimage 3820×1923 86.7 KB\n\nimage 3820×1923 86.7 KB\n\nimage 1900×1372 26 KB\n\nimage 1900×1372 26 KB\n\nimage 1869×1240 23.5 KB\n\nimage 1869×1240 23.5 KB\n\nFeel free to share your thoughts and ideas! I’d love to hear how FRCMonkey could better serve the FRC community!",
