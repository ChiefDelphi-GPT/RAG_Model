We have been trying very hard to work out most of the bugs early on with these projects, and make them as accessible as possible. I hope you all enjoy them and it was worth the wait!\n\nOver the next few days everything will update from YAGSL branded to YASS branded and we will move YAGSL under our new github org.\n\nCheck out our official announcement trailer — we’re super excited to share this with you all!\n\nWatch the trailer:\n\nWebsite: https://yetanothersoftwaresuite.com\n\nGitHub Organization: https://github.com/Yet-Another-Software-Suite/\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/yass\n\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/yassrobotics\n\nWe’re excited to introduce YASS — Yet Another Software Suite , a modern, modular ecosystem built for FRC teams (and coming soon to FTC ). YASS is designed to make robot programming simpler , faster , and more scalable , while keeping everything vendor-agnostic, sim-capable, and team-friendly.\n\nDocs: Yet Another Mechanism System | YAMS ( yagsl.gitbook.io/yams ) Examples: github.com/…/YAMS/examples\n\nYAMS is a high-level abstraction layer for building subsystems. It currently supports the following mechanisms, each with their own dedicated config class (except DoubleJointedArm which composes two ArmConfig s):\n\nArm\n\nElevator\n\nPivot (used for turrets and wrists)\n\nShooter\n\nSwerveModule\n\nSwerveDrive\n\nDoubleJointedArm\n\nDifferentialMechanism\n\nAll these work seamlessly with the unified SmartMotorController interface and are configured using their respective config classes, making setup consistent and easy.\n\nYAMS provides:\n\nA unified SmartMotorController interface\n\nShared config system: SmartMotorControllerConfig\n\nSupport for SparkMax , TalonFX , TalonFXS , ThriftyNova , SparkFlex , and (soon) ReduxNitrate\n\nHelpful runtime exceptions that tell you how to fix unsupported features\n\nSysId built in for Arm , Elevator , Pivot , and SmartMotorController\n\nSupport for same-vendor external encoders\n\nUses motor controller PID and Feedforward when available\n\nBuilt-in fully customizable telemetry\n\nSeamless simulation\n\nAdvantageKit integration at the setpoint boundary\n\nLive-Tuning built-in! Just enable it and change the variable fields under NT:/Tuning\n\nIntegration with vendor simulation!\n\n** Simulation and real code are nearly 1:1 identical. (Only difference is the need to call .simIterate() each simulationPeriodic **\n\nSimulate subsystems + commands with full fidelity Test robot code without the robot Make code reusable across hardware Accelerate onboarding and iteration\n\nTry it now: https://yamgen.com\n\nYAMG is a visual mechanism generator that lets you:\n\nDesign Arm , Elevator , and Pivot as easily as filling out a form\n\nSimulate motion, constraints based off the code generator form\n\nExport ready-to-use Java code compatible without using YAMS\n\nRepo: github.com/…/YALL\n\nYALL is a cleaned-up wrapper of LimelightHelpers.java , featuring:\n\nImproved structure and full JavaDocs\n\nReal-robot integration for Limelight pipelines\n\nNote: YALL is currently the only YASS module without simulation support.\n\nYAGSL is now part of the YASS ecosystem and continues to be maintained and improved alongside the rest of the suite.\n\n3481 BroncBotz\n\n9658 Camber\n\n457 Grease Monkeys\n\n3561 RoboRaiders\n\n457 Grease Monkeys\n\n3561 RoboRaiders\n\n3481 BroncBotz\n\n5561 Flushing Raider Robotics (shoutout @chris_7898 !)\n\n9738 Ionic Bond\n\n9658 Camber\n\n8818 The Foe\n\nAnd many more!\n\n“YAMS has made coding 10× easier. In a week I went from not being able to code at all to a functional robot. YAMS takes all the guesswork out — I’d recommend it to anyone.” — 3561 RoboRaiders\n\n“YAMS almost feels like a cheat code for creating high-performance subsystems. It’s extremely configurable and removes nearly all the heartache that usually comes with subsystem coding.”\n\n“The sim support blew away our expectations — we can test the robot without the robot, increasing productivity outside of meeting hours.”\n\n“Before YAMS, tuning performance felt like tribal knowledge. Now it’s documented, configurable, and easy to teach. New students can contribute right away.” — 6911 SO BOTZ\n\n“YAMS was easier to set up and led to better, more consistent results than the alternatives. The YASS team also provided top-tier support.” — 1799 Wired Up\n\n“Amazing documentation. There was a full setup guide explaining what every part does in context.” — 2183 TigerBots\n\nA huge thank you to all the beta testers who helped put YASS through its paces and provided invaluable feedback. Your input made this possible!\n\nAnd a very personal thank you to my wife , whose support and patience have been incredible throughout this journey.\n\nExplore the examples\n\nUse the code on your robot\n\nTry the sim\n\nGive feedback or submit PRs\n\nShare what your team builds!\n\nJoin our Discord community for support, questions, and collaboration: https://discord.gg/yass\n\nThanks for reading — and good luck this season. We can’t wait to see what you create with YASS\n\n— The YASS Team yetanothersoftwaresuite.com github.com/Yet-Another-Software-Suite",

I thought it would help some teams, but at the cost of flexibility and a deep understanding of how these mechanisms actually work. After playing around with this for a bit, I’m happy to say my opinion has definitely changed. There’s plenty of flexibility and even allows for full customization with YAMG for teams that feel like YAMS doesn’t fill all their needs. And while it makes programming common mechanisms like elevators and arms a lot easier, students will still need to learn and understand core concepts to properly configure and make their mechanisms function correctly. In fact, I believe this will allow students to focus more on robotics concepts they’re actually interested in instead of overwhelming them with low level code.\n\nI believe YASS will help raise the floor for both new and experienced teams by allowing them to work on higher level logic instead of spending days or weeks struggling to get basic code for their mechanisms working, giving teams the ability to rapidly prototype, and providing built in sim support which will allow teams to get a head start instead of rushing to get something working in time for their first competition. I’m excited to introduce this project to the rest of my team this fall. Amazing work!",

I can see where its very very overpowered (like intake motors which just turn on/off and dont need velocity control).\n\nEven for super complex mechanisms that you want a single mech2d for its useful bc you only need to combine all positions and calculate the joint. Then put it in your own mech2d. Ignoring all of the sim and config stuff. (I even name all of the commands from YAMS so they showup when you publish Subsystems to SmartDashboard!)\n\nYAMG is giving someone the full code if they really don’t want to use YAMS bc they dont trust black boxes. It will ultimately be slower bc there are some tedious features that will seem like bloat if included in YAMG (like live tuning).\n\nDo you know of anything that YAMS isn’t complete enough for?",
