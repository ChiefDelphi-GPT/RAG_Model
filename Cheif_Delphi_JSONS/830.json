We (myself and another programming mentor) sometimes have to just nudge them in the right direction, but they are very self-directing and pulled off some (in my opinion) very impressive things with our robot.\n\nThere is sample code available in Python (and we’ll be publishing ours shortly). There is a lot of Java code out there, but we found that it’s pretty easy to look at FRC Java sample code and convert that to Python.\n\nI should also add that I’ve gotten amazing support by asking Python questions about it here too.",

Any motivated high schooler should be able to jump between Python and Java just fine, set that expectation out of the gate and they’ll measure up to it.\n\nThe school claiming to teach Python and the school actually teaching how to program a real project in a collaborative way using libraries to achieve objectives using Python are completely different things. Don’t expect moving languages to solve the underlying lack of knowledge of collaborative programming processes or ability to grok high level objectives of “these motors are wrapped in this subsystem which is called by this command”.\n\nI recommend building a ‘skeleton robot’ that mostly works or is missing a non-critical subsystem for them to hack around inside of and complete final objectives and tuning within, before trying to get them to program a whole robot. It may take a few years to get to a whole robot. You’re in this for the long haul - when they start explaining the abstraction choices to each other, you’ll know you’re headed in the right direction.",

Python support across FRC is spotty.\n\nWe only used CTRE stuff on the robot this year, and their Python support is fantastic, but even there I found some cases where mypy’s type checker would toss errors despite the code being correct. Works, but, not a perfect implementation.\n\nOther vendordeps like Grapple, when I tried to use their laser range finder, seemed nonfunctional.\n\nAnd in our case using the MagicBot framework means giving up some integrations with things like PathPlanner or CTRE ’s Swerve generator that are command based. But, I consider Magicbot a net positive. We built our drivetrain code around the tuner constants files that CTRE generated for our bot. PathPlanner was still useful for generating trajectories, we just followed them with our framework. Same for Choreo trajectories. They were both easy to work with.",

PixyCam 2 is another example that also only has “official” support for FRC using Java (and LabVIEW). In this last case, we use the wpilib.SerialPort instead of any custom Pixy2 classes.\n\nIt would be nice if YAGSL or the majority of third-party community libraries could be use on code independently of the team’s language.",
