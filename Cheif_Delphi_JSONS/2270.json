                    "cooked": "So, powering a robot using an extension cord/mains power. At a recent outreach event I noted that we are increasingly just running through our batterys and killing the old ones we have by over draining them. I was thinking it would be better if we could just plug the robot into the wall.\n\nOn first thought the biggest limitation I see is spikes current draw. Most wall outlets in the us run on a 15A breaker at 120v. So that is 1800 watts. FRC robots run with a nominal voltage of around 13v. So 1800w/13v=138.46A. So in theory that is fine for the 120A breaker we have in FRC but that is 120A under on constant load, in normal robot conditions we see currents draw much higher than that.\n\nWith running a robot for an outreach event in mind it seems that might be possible to get down to below the 138A limit with current limits set correctly. But I think there is a problem with how the motors react with putting power back into the system when using an AC->DC converter. But I could be wrong about that.\n\nWhat do people think? Has anyone tried using mains power to power a robot? And if so how did you go about doing that?",

You could easily slap 6 of those in a battery-sized box with some heat sinking for 150A. They’re like 85% efficient so I think you’re still good on a 120V 15A circuit. I also just realized they’re $200 a pop . Definitely keep a battery in parallel, and this ignores the logistical issues of that 12/3 cable the robot needs now.\n\n13v is too high as well, nobody is fielding robots with anything higher than a 12.8V battery after bleeding off the surface charge. The 120A breaker is basically a joke in the time scale of an FRC match. It does tell you that the robot is pulling less than 120A on average, as I’ve never tripped one even during long practice sessions. As long as you can feed in 120A on average, a battery in parallel with your wall power should never run out.",

You can do that with a solenoid because you know where the inductive kick comes from and you can put the diode after the switch.\n\nYou could build up an active zener with a serious power transistor that could do the clamping.  Using a diode and a significant capacitor is a better method if you are trying to kill the peak.  Add a resistor across the diode to keep the capacitor voltage near battery voltage when its not active.  A power zener or an active zener/clamp circuit across the capacitor would be smart too.  Though with normal capacitors is easy enough to buy them in 24 Volt rating Calculating the energy clipping capacity needed is probably do-able, but it depends on a LOT of things, many of which we only know roughly.",

                    "cooked": "On my unit I’m using an active rectifier module, also called an “ideal diode”.  Its got some smarts on it in addition to a normal diode AND a big mosfet.  Basically, when you first pass power through the diode, it charges a capacitor.  Then the smarts take that and turn on the mosfet, which drops the forward voltage across the diode to darn near zero.  The capacitor voltage drops slowly.  Once it gets too low, the mosfet drops out and the capacitor is re-charged by the diode voltage drop.  Here’s what I bought: https://www.ebay.com/itm/394881819726\n\nThere’s another version that has a ground terminal on it that is a “all the time” active rectifier.  BUT, it has more limitations that the one above.\n\nA big-ol shottky rectifier would work fine too, but your 12v will be a bit less.; 11.9 Volts or so. Even a regular big-ol diode would be OK too, but you will get about 11.3 Volts on a 12V power supply.\n\nHere’s the supercapacitor module I used.  Note that the balancing circuitry is CRITICAL for function, and you need to be super careful not to short these things.  They can deliver wire-melting currents! https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08CGXJY2J\n\nHere’s the 83 Amp power supply its all based on.  We found out quickly that braking regeneration makes this sucker unhappy by itself…  Shuts down in protest.  For stuff with this kind of current output, remember that it can MELT undersized wires and foolishly applied tools! https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HGQXW9V?th=1\n\nThe dumb filament 12V bulb is needed to make sure the output goes to zero when you turn it off.  Its also a good reminder that its ON.  Get it from your local auto parts place.  The frame ground is a PITA to work around, just so you know.  Might try to find something with two actual wires…",

The typical, off-the-shelf power supply will not have this feature. The tolerance on the output voltage is determined by the tolerance of the voltage reference in the controller chips. This is typically ±1% to ±5% so it is virtually guaranteed that the power supplies will not share the output current.\n\nA coworker who thought he knew better wasted a lot of time on a system with 3 paralleled power supplies. They did not share the dynamic loads properly and caused all sorts of problems.\n\nrich.varone:\n\nIdeally I think you’d want something like this but sized for FRC motors: ODrive Regen Clamp – ODrive Robotics\n\nPlease note that the device linked is meant to work with an external resistor (see the 4 picture) connected to the R+ and R- terminals.

                    "cooked": "This is a pretty major TLDR kinda reply…  I’ve had to do stuff like this professionally.\n\nOn the brake resistor side, there are three critical parameters: resistance, power rating, and energy rating.  Peak power rating is related to energy, so you may find that one listed.\n\nO-Drive’s braking resistor sizing stuff is useful and worth a read.\n\nWith heat sink you need the peak resistor current less than 80 Amps; so R>0.15 Ohms.  That’s 960 Watts during a max power brake event.  You might THINK you need a 1kW resistor, but you don’t.  You only feed that resistor when you are braking!\n\nWhat you DO need is one that will not fuse/fry at 80 Amps.  Wire wound resistors can handle 10-100x their long-term power levels for -short- times.  Wire wound is the key item here, NOT film of any sort.  So, it would’t be crazy to use four, 0.8 Ohm resistors in parallel.  That way if you fry one, you still have protection Current sense resistors are commonly around 0.1 Ohm; you could use four in a series parallel configuration and get a useful value.\n\nSpecial resistors made to be braking resistors are designed for high peak and specified for energy rating.  Here’s an example.  $17 isn’t bad, but the resistor value is WAAAAY too high for 12V operation.  Its specified for 10X overload (800 Watts) for 10 -seconds-!  That’s 8 kilo Joules!  Yike! https://www.automationdirect.com/adc/shopping/catalog/drives_-a-_soft_starters/ac_variable_frequency_drives_(vfd)/braking_units_-a-_resistors/gs-br-080w200\n\nYou should also have some idea of how much energy you need to dissipate!  For a drive system, the 1/2 M V^2 kinetic energy of the robot will end up somewhere.  A decent fraction will end up heating the windings of the motor and heating the drive system.  You shouldn’t hope for more than maybe 10-15% to end up in the electronics.  The rest ends up in your pulse suppressor.  You need the voltage on the capacitor bank to NOT go above the voltage rating of both the capacitors AND that of the motor drivers.  So, one answer is a BIG capacitor bank that can hold the whole surge.  Expensive and nerve-wracking…  Having a way to dump some of that energy into a resistor pulls down the needed capacitor rating.\n\nKnowing the potential regenerated energy will let you scope out how much power handling you need to design for.\n\nOne semi-silly answer is a stead load.  During normal operation its wasting power, but during a pulse the diode isolates the power supply so that the steady load is taking regenerated current.  Light bulbs are cheap resistors…  Its not going to take a LOT of energy, but its something.\n\nNote that for a tethered robot, its probably not going to get anywhere near full speed on the drive system.  Flywheels and elevators, however, WILL get to full speed.\n\nThere are special resistors with actual Joules of energy ratings; I used some on a device designed to deliver 500 Amp pulses at 5kV.  Vaporize things power!  I had to limit the peak current to avoid frying the switching device, thus the massively parallel bank of non-inductive energy rated resistors.  Fun times!\n\n1149.80 KB",
