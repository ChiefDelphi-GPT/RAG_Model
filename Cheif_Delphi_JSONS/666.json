                    "cooked": "I dabble in 3d printing at the hobby level, have owned a few Prusas over the years and currently own a Bambu A1. I work at a relatively large metal fab/sheet metal shop full time, and after hearing I have a printer at home, they’ve asked me to provide a couple of recommendations for a 3d printer for use at work.\n\nUnfortunately my knowledge is pretty limited outside the scope of common FRC printer brands such as Bambu, Prusa and Creality. So while not directly FRC related, I figured there may be a few knowledgeable folks in this community that could provide some direction/advice on the topic?\n\nAs far as details/requirements of this printer, my work doesn’t really seem to know what they want (or what they want to make with it). I’m guessing this machine will end up being used for custom/1-off tooling and jigs. It’s sounding like they’ve got a rough budget of $35k USD, but are willing to go higher “if needed”. I personally am limiting the scope to FDM based printers with minimal to no post processing needed. This will be the companies first foray into 3d printing, and extra post processing steps with resin or SLS printers I think will just be an added headache.\n\nI’ve heard good things from a few of my FRC teams’ sponsors about Markforged machines, so am planning to reach out to them for some initial quotes. I’m not sure if a company like Stratasys would have anything in their lineup within this budget. I get the feeling I’m stuck a bit in the middle between the higher end hobby grade machines, and the lower end industrial machines.",

My go to suggestion for an introductory printer would be the Bambu Labs P1S (~$600) or the Anycubic Kobra S1(~$500). Both can print with a wide range of materials and have advanced features. Both are under $1000. If yall want to continue with 3D printing another suggestion would be the Mosaic Element which is a pro grade printer which can print even the most advanced materials. It starts at around $10000 USD. My best suggestion is to get a high end consumer printer such as the Bambu Labs X1C, X1E or the Prusa Core One. $35k doesn’t get too much in the industrial printing world and having this starting base might give yall an idea of what the process is like.",

If your looking for a printer for work your definitely going to want something that’s fully enclosed, has a hardened steel nozzle and textured PEI build plate, and can reach temperatures of 300-350C. These specs are key if you want to run high-performance materials like nylon, polycarbonate, or carbon fiber blends. BambuLabs is what I usually recommend to people, especially if people new to 3D printing will be using the printer. The X1 Carbon and H2D are both great options to look at as their very capable and reliable machines. Ultimaker is what we use at my work currently and they’ve worked great so far. Id also recommend taking a look at a couple of Prusas new printers like the Core One or HT90",

They are so cheap and fast it’s silly to buy anything else as a first printer for corporate use. The slicer isn’t as good for inexperienced users as Markforged, but it does allow more customization.\n\nMarkforged still has everyone beat in terms of slicer use and almost surefire set it and forget it success, but it is much slower than the Bambu’s. You don’t need more than an onyx one (not sold anymore) or maybe onyx mark two if you want to do fiber reinforced prints.",

Set it up, stock one material, and have a nice tool that works and a material that is very robust for industry use. A bonus is you guys will be able to play around with weird, custom sheet metal tooling and jigs off the printer. Onyx works extremely well for sheet metal guides, fixtures, prototype dies for a few uses, etc\n\n-Ronnie",

Total PO in the range of $8k. Get a LOT of filament and a couple maintenance items (spare build plates, spare built hotends, etc).\n\nWe use 3x X1C for both prototype and low-volume production of fancy contours that would be a nightmare to cut with conventional subtractive tech, then assemble primarily with heat-set inserts.\n\nIf you are nervous about after-sales support, go with Markforged and get a maintenance contract etc through one of their resellers. It’ll be way more expensive than an intern or fab tech cleaning the printers once a week, but that’ll still make sense for certain firms with leaner staffing and carefully defined employee scopes.\n\nBambulab is Chinese & the primary path for their “print from slicer” option is via an online account that runs through Chinese servers. If network security and information leakage for military applications is a concern, I’d talk to Markforged first.",
