Now we use photon vision and two arducams (one black and white and the other colored) along with an orange pi 5 pro and I was wondering, what other options are their in terms of cameras, vision detection software/systems, why teams use some systems over others, and is there anything worth looking into in regards for future years? Along with this I was wondering, is there anything that your teams have done to have students be interested in learning more about vision and detection on the field of objects? As a senior and a lead it makes me a bit worried that not that many people on my team are actually wanting to learn more about this and just wanted some advice on that end.",

                    "cooked": "Hello,\n\nI was a co-captain of team 4572 last year and I’m finishing my first year of college now. I lead/oversaw the code and electrical departments on the team. I cannot speak that much towards vision, as my specialty was auto, but I wanted to give my thoughts on posterity. I’ll forward this to our vision specialist, though.\n\nI graduated without someone new who could really replace me. I don’t say that as an ego boost, there just weren’t very interested freshmen. I wasn’t able to take someone under my wing during my senior year. I remember we tried to implement something like that, but it just fell apart.\n\nBut I’d argue that the hole the other co-captain left was even greater than my own. He was the team’s machining lead. Not only was he the machining lead, he was the only machinist. He sacrificed so much for this team, between machining and CAD and spending insane amounts of time outside of meetings working on the robot. He tried so hard to get other students involved in the CNC mill but no one was that interested. It’s still shocking to me because, honestly, someone just needed to suck it up and learn while he was still around and able to teach in person. People didn’t realize the significance of the knowledge they were about to lose. A very inexperienced member in machining was given the title of lead this year, and I remember how often the guy and our lead mentor was contacting him about how to do this or that.\n\nI don’t know what we could have done differently to get more interest. I think that some people want to sell their souls to FIRST and others just don’t care enough. The latter isn’t necessarily a bad thing, they just have different priorities. People don’t realize what they lost until its gone. One of the greatest lessons I learned was that you can’t force someone to care more than they do. You can’t force them to be more interested, you can’t force them to want to learn more. You can push them and try to make them realize the importance of what you’re leaving behind, but they’ll only do it of their own volition. They’ll have to figure it out, probably asking you next season. Maybe try to schedule some calls or meetups over the summer about vision, I’d recommend a bit later into the summer to allow the burnout to fade (not sure if that’s a problem with your team but it certainly was for ours). They could just not want to do anything right now, but may be willing later. If it turns out that no one wants to learn how to do vision, then so be it.",

                    "cooked": "My perception is that there are two main camps in FRC vision, PhotonVision and Limelight.  There is almost certainly another group of hardy souls that are rolling their own with OpenCV or neural network object detection models (e.g. YOLO, RetinaNet).\n\nFor PhotonVision, almost any USB camera is a potential option.  There is a list of camera/coprocessor combinations that have been tested with PhotonVision , but this is only a sampling of possible cameras.\n\nKey reasons why teams might choose PhotonVision or Limelight include cost (PhotonVision systems will be less) and perceptions about support, software reliability, and software features.  Some teams prefer a hardware/software vendor where there is some clear pathway to support and software development and release is vendor-managed rather than open-source.  Other teams are fine with open-source and may see it as a way to get new features faster or tweak the code themselves if they would like.  Some teams prefer a tight coupling of hardware and software, while others prefer a flexible ecosystem that lets them use what they have or what they would like.\n\nAs for getting students interested in robot vision, I’d try to find the ones that are interested in making a high-performance robot.  If you don’t have anyone that cares about the robot perfoming well and competing effectively, you have bigger problems. FIRST designs games to be playable in some sense by very low-resource robots, but playing them with all driving and operation done “manually” with no vision help is frustrating.  The demoralization increases when there are many teams you play with that are giving their drivers all sorts of vision help and have supercharged their autonomous routines with vision.\n\nTo the extent that you have a robot that is currently being aided by vision, let students drive and play the game with vision on, and then make them play with vision turned off.  If your robot won’t run without vision, change the code to make that possible.  The difference in gameplay effectiveness should be enough to convince anyone that the team must have some members capable of implementing vision.",
