                    "cooked": ", let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. So, the user has given me a piece of text that's wrapped in HTML tags, specifically within <p> tags, and there are spans with classes like \"abbreviation\" and \"tooltiptext\". My task is to clean up this text by removing all the HTML tags and making sure it reads smoothly in standard English.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the original text is about. From what I can gather, it's discussing why FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition) doesn't allow the use of PWM-controlled brushless motors. The main issue seems to be that when the robot is disabled, the PWM signal might not properly stop the motor, which could be dangerous. The user also mentions that these alternative motors are smaller, lighter, cheaper, and faster than the ones approved by FRC.\n\nSo, my goal is to remove all the HTML elements without changing the meaning. That means getting rid of the <p> tags at the beginning and end since those are just paragraph tags. Then, each span tag with \"abbreviation\" probably contains an acronym that needs to be expanded on hover or something, so I should replace them with their respective full names in parentheses.\n\nLooking at the first part: \"<p>I'm assuming...\" – I'll keep the opening quote and then proceed. There are multiple span tags here, each with either \"FRC\" or \"PWM\" and their tooltiptext attributes. I'll extract the acronyms and put them in parentheses next to the expanded terms.\n\nI have to make sure that the flow remains natural. For example, after \"FRC\", I'll write \"(FIRST Robotics Competition)\" right after it. Similarly, \"PWM\" becomes \"(Pulse Width Modulation)\". Also, I need to ensure that the sentence structure is correct after removing the tags, so maybe adding a comma or period where necessary.\n\nMoving on to the second paragraph: It starts with another <p> tag and discusses the possibility of getting these motors approved. Again, I'll strip out the <p> and handle the spans similarly.\n\nOne thing to watch out for is ensuring that I don't accidentally alter the meaning by reordering sentences or changing word forms. I need to maintain the original intent as much as possible.\n\nAfter cleaning up, I'll read through the entire text to make sure it makes sense without the HTML and flows naturally. Maybe check if any punctuation is needed between sentences now that the tags are gone. Also, ensure that all abbreviations are clearly explained in context.\n\nIn summary, my steps are:\n1. Remove all <p>, <span>, and <template> tags.\n2. Replace each abbreviation with its expanded form in parentheses.\n3. Ensure proper punctuation and sentence structure.\n4. Combine everything into a single paragraph without line breaks.\n\nThis should result in a clean, readable text that preserves the original message while adhering to standard English formatting.\n</assistant>\n\nAlright, let's break down the process step-by-step:\n\n1. **Remove HTML Tags**: Start by eliminating all HTML tags such as <p>, <span>, and <template>. This leaves only the text content.\n\n2. **Expand Abbreviations**: Identify all instances of the abbreviations (like FRC and PWM) embedded within the spans. Replace each with their full form, enclosed in parentheses next to the original abbreviation for clarity.\n\n3. **Ensure Proper Punctuation and Structure**: After removing tags, check for proper punctuation and sentence flow. Add commas or periods where necessary to ensure readability.\n\n4. **Combine into a Single Paragraph**: Merge the cleaned-up text into one cohesive paragraph without introducing new line breaks.\n\nBy following these steps, the cleaned text maintains the original meaning while presenting it in a standard, grammatically correct format.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\nOriginal Text (with HTML):\n```html\n<p>I’m assuming the reason that <span class=\"abbreviation\">FRC</template class=\"tooltiptext\" data-text=\"FIRST Robotics Competition\"></span> doesn’t allow off-the-shelf <span class=\"abbreviation\">PWM</template class=\"tooltiptext\" data-text=\"Pulse Width Modulation\"></span> R/C car brushless motors and motor controllers is because they can’t guarantee that when the robot is disabled and the <span class=\"abbreviation\">PWM</template class=\"tooltiptext\" data-text=\"Pulse Width Modulation\"></span> signal goes to a disabled state that the controller will stop the motor appropriately.  Is that true?</p>\n\n<p>Is there a way we could get these approved for <span class=\"abbreviation\">FRC</template class=\"tooltiptext\" data-text=\"FIRST Robotics Competition\"></span> use?  I particularly like that they’re small, light, inexpensive, and typically up in a speed range that we don’t normally get from <span class=\"abbreviation\">FRC</template class=\"tooltiptext\" data-text=\"FIRST Robotics Competition\"></span>-approved brushless DC motors.</p>\n```\n\nCleaned-Up Text:\n- Remove all HTML tags, resulting in:\n  ```\n  I'm assuming the reason that FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition) doesn’t allow off-the-shelf PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) R/C car brushless motors and motor controllers is because they can’t guarantee that when the robot is disabled and the PWM signal goes to a disabled state that the controller will stop the motor appropriately. Is that true?\n\n  Is there a way we could get these approved for FRC use? I particularly like that they’re small, light, inexpensive, and typically up in a speed range that we don’t normally get from FRC-approved brushless DC motors.\n  ```\n\n- Ensure proper punctuation and flow:\n  - The first sentence ends with \"apparently.\" Adding a period.\n  - Combining both paragraphs into one, separated by a space instead of a line break.\n\nFinal Cleaned-Up Version:\n\"I'm assuming the reason that FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition) doesn’t allow off-the-shelf PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) R/C car brushless motors and motor controllers is because they can’t guarantee that when the robot is disabled and the PWM signal goes to a disabled state that the controller will stop the motor appropriately.

Even the kitbot now uses CAN communication, wiring motor controllers directly with CAN. PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) isn't commonly used anymore, and for applications that require higher speeds, CAN seems even more essential.",

To ensure my responses are appropriate and safe for all users, I've implemented measures to limit certain types of requests.\n```\n\nThe user wants me to clean up some text by removing HTML tags and unnecessary elements, while preserving the original meaning. They specified that the output should be a single paragraph without line breaks, using standard English grammar and punctuation. Also, they emphasized changing as little as possible to maintain the text's coherence.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the input was a single HTML paragraph tag containing text, and the output was the same text without the <p> tags and properly punctuated. So, I need to apply similar processing to the given query.\n\nFirst, I'll identify the HTML tags in the input text. In this case, it's just the opening and closing <p> tags. I'll remove these to get rid of the formatting. Next, I'll check if there are any unnecessary elements like extra spaces or incorrect punctuation. The original text seems fine in that regard.\n\nNow, I'll format the cleaned text into a single paragraph. Since the original had no line breaks, I don't need to worry about that. Finally, I'll ensure that the punctuation is correct. The period at the end is already present, so that's good.\n\nPutting it all together, after cleaning and formatting, the text reads: \"Controlling sensorless brushed motors is extremely different from controlling sensorless brushless motors.\"\n\nI made sure not to alter the technical terms or the structure of the sentence beyond removing the HTML tags and adding proper punctuation where necessary. This meets the user's requirements effectively.\n```",

While it is possible to measure this back-emf, modern systems often struggle with accurately interpreting it because the signal is very weak and susceptible to noise. Additionally, engineers working with such systems face challenges in accurately extracting the necessary information from the back-emf signals. As a result, sensorless brushless motor control methods generally rely more heavily on advanced algorithms and estimation techniques rather than direct sensing of the back-emf itself.",

I clearly recall them demonstrating how it could operate in both sensored and sensorless modes, unlike the NEO models introduced that year, which required specialized thin encoder wires. However, when the Falcon series and subsequent brushless motors were released, there was no mention of a sensorless mode being available.",
