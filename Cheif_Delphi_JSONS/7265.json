Since I only have 1 camera facing the rear of the robot (our shooter is faced behind us, and is in a fixed angle). Because of this, I want to use PathPlanner to compensate for the lack of detection of the notes.\n\nFor now, our autonomous code consists of shooting a preloaded note, and then using PID to drive a multitude of lines towards the next note and back to the speaker.\n\nI’ve tried to follow PathPlanner’s docs as best as possible, but I seem to have some issues:\n\nMy robot won’t log its behavior We use NEOs for the drivetrain, so we use URCL, like the PathPlanner docs state\n\nMy robot won’t log its behavior\n\nWe use NEOs for the drivetrain, so we use URCL, like the PathPlanner docs state\n\nWe have not done any sort of SysID this is new to me, and I believe it was necessary, but because my robot isn’t logging data, I can’t make use of it image 829×176 11 KB\n\nWe have not done any sort of SysID\n\nthis is new to me, and I believe it was necessary, but because my robot isn’t logging data, I can’t make use of it image 829×176 11 KB\n\nimage 829×176 11 KB\n\nimage 829×176 11 KB\n\nSimulations were unable to reach correctly follow the paths I’ve drawn I used the values 1.2 and 0.7 for beta and zeta of the RAMSETE controller.

First, it would be really helpful if you could share all of your code, preferably as a link to a GitHub repo.\n\nDriving paths:\n\nYou didn’t share your code, but I think you’re on the right track with driveChassisSpeeds . The chassisSpeeds object will be in meters per second, so if your tankDrive method expects duty cycle, you’ll need to do a conversion.\n\nA more advanced (and accurate) way to drive would be with closed-loop velocity control. This is where you would use SysID values for feedforward, and you’d need to tune PID to get the right velocity. The Trajectory Tutorial covers some of this.\n\nSysID and logging:\n\nDoes your SysID routine run, but you are unable to find the logs, or is the routine not even running?\n\nCan you provide more information on why you think URCL is not logging? The log files should be on the roboRIO or on a USB drive you plugged into the roboRIO. If it’s not logging, maybe you are out of space on the robotRIO or the USB stick is full or not recognized (formatted incorrectly.) More details will help us troubleshoot with you.",

Also, start with a path that is straight forward and back with no turns.\n\nIt’s hard to help you without logging working. As other have said, you probably need to delete existing logs, which you can do with the WPILib log tool.\n\nI would say based on where you are now, I would also be concerned about you finishing by the regional. I would definitely not want you to give up, but this may be best for an offseason project.\n\nHere is our code, if it helps:",
