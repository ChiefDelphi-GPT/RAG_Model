The mounting pitch of the camera plus the detected apriltag pitch determines the angle that you would use in this case for solving the adjacent triangle side length (distance).\n\nBut then, I don’t know how I can retrieve the vertical offset of a camera connected to the RoboRIO.\n\nYou’ll need to measure the height and pitch of your camera from the ground.\n\nI’ve gotta ask, what’s your motivation for running apriltag detection on RoboRIO instead of something like a Limelight or coprocessor running PhotonVision? As far as I know getting usable framerates on the roborio is difficult. Both Limelight and PhotonVision also have more complete tag pose estimation using solvePnP techniques, which will help you find the distance to the tag (and more) easily.",

It should be easy/cheap to get quickly since you can grab a popular option like a Raspberry Pi 4/5 or Orange Pi 5.\n\nAs for finding the pitch of the detected apriltag in your setup, you’ll need to know at least the vertical field-of-view of your camera first. The most accurate way of determining this will be calibrating your camera, maybe through opencv or a tool like calibdb .\n\nWith an estimated vertical focal length in pixels (if not calibrating, this can be calculated from a given vertical FOV and the sensor resolution) you can do another trig calculation with the vertical focal length and detected apriltag center pixel y-coordinate to find the pitch angle through the camera’s focal point.\n\nNote that this is an approximation and won’t represent the exact pitch angle for several reasons. Here’s how this is calculated in PhotonVision for reference. If you want something more accurate, you’ll have to look into solvePnP pose estimation of fiducials, which is what is used in PhotonVision and Limelight software.",
