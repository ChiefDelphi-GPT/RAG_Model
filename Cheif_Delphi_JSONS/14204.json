                    "cooked": "As WPILib has expanded over the past few years, so too has its pool of contributing developers.  One thing that has become clear to me is that contributing to WPILib is an extremely valuable experience for students, as it teaches you how to interact with a living codebase at enterprise scale, complete with substantial CI, enforced style standards, and rigorous code review.\n\nHowever, WPILib’s contributing guidelines are quite old and date from the days when the library was freshly-hosted as an open-source project.  I’ve heard from multiple students that, while they’ve found contributing to be a rewarding activity, they did not feel that it was obvious that student contribution was desired, and they did not find that the guidelines adequately prepared them for the review process.\n\nClearly we need to improve here.  The first step to improvement is planning - in keeping with the recent trend of “seeking CD feedback on new WPILib developments,” I figured I’d start a thread here to source community feedback on contributing guidelines.\n\nSo, what would you like to see in the way of contributing guidelines for WPILib?  Be as vague or as specific as you like.  Some ideas to kick off discussion, that have occurred to me:\n\nA “student-to-contributor” tutorial sequence of some sort on FRC-docs, that details the “happy path” and likely pain points when transitioning from developing team code to developing open-source library code\n\nA “WPILib architecture and philosophy” article that describes the core structure of the WPILib project and its motivation\n\nGit hooks for auto-formatting available for new developers, so that PRs are less likely to get caught up on linting errors.",

I think it’s also important to mention that contributing to WPILib doesn’t require some really high-level programming knowledge; a programming student with a robot or two of experience should be able to handle most stuff–especially with the immense amount of support from the WPILib team. Proof: a significant amount of the current WPILib team are recent alumni, who got involved while being students and then “graduated” into the team.\n\nThis might’ve been changed already, but the requirement of implementing both C++ and Java changes drives potential contributors away and isn’t really true anyway: if needed, you’ll get help with the other language.\n\nIssue triage/labeling should be improved: many issues don’t have a clear indication of what their status is, what exactly is intended, etc. Keeping issues up-to-date with sufficient information about what exactly is intended, any barriers for the issue to happen, and the like would make contributing easier. Marking issues as good first issue , component labels, and perhaps some sort of complexity level could really help new-ish contributors find issues to gain footing.\n\nFeature requests should be addressed better and discussed earlier: I’ve seen multiple cases where someone starts working on an issue, and only when it reaches the PR review stage then it turns out that the change described in the issue isn’t desired. The time to discuss/debate feature designs should be at the issue stage, not after someone puts time into implementing it.\n\nCommunity transparency/involvement can definitely be improved; these CD threads are definitely a step in the right direction in that regard.",

On Windows, installing clang-format isn’t as simple as running the LLVM installer because Gradle autodetects its broken compiler and uses that instead of using MSVC. You have to run the installer, copy clang-format out of it and put it in PATH, then uninstall LLVM.\n\nFor Java formatting, we already have ./gradlew javaFormat and ./gradlew spotlessApply , and they’re documented in the main readme . They also get run by ./gradlew build and even subprojects like ./gradlew wpilibj:build , but no one runs those because they take too long and require a C++ compiler (Java calls into C++ code).",

And it’s never thought about or discussed after that.\n\nBut I’m all for keeping lint passes as required. I’m all too creative myself when it comes to code formatting, and I don’t want that unleashed on the world.\n\nOblarg:\n\nA “student-to-contributor” tutorial sequence\n\nYes. Also, start with a “Why should you contribute to WPILib?” hook.\n\nAlternate things to discuss too - how to make/explore quick changes to wpilib. IE, in java at least, a quick answer is to copy-paste the contents of a .class file into your own .java file, find/replace names, and include that new one with modifications.  Show the easy path to try out something new, then wrap back around to how to contribute that change back to WPILib.\n\nHaving public forum meetings where anyone can join in to hear about current activities, associate some faces or voices with the current contributors, and hear first-hand where the pain points are at, all could be helpful.\n\nThis is a bigger burden but something to consider… if someone’ serious about wanting to start but doesn’t know where or how, pair them up with an experienced person for mentorship. This requires quite a bit of extra time and formal dedication probably… but I can’t think of a better way to ramp someone from zero to productive.",

Being able to tell new contributors to run vagrant up (we use Docker + Vagrant - so substitute this for some docker-compose exec command in WPILib’s case) as opposed to downloading/installing a bunch of different pieces of tooling is helpful.\n\nI think WPILib will probably have an easier time implementing something like Docker/Docker Compose and having a few commands built that run inside the container for building/testing/whatnot (I worked on a project that had this setup recently and it was a BREEZE to get up and running).",
