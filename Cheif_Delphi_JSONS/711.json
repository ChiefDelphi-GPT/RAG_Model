Fortunately for you, or not, I might fit that description.\n\nFirst: Why it WAS needed. WAY back in the early 2000s, there were occasionally, er, “issues” with robots that lost most but not all of their power. 330 spent most of their first IRI wandering across the field and then dying and then wandering and then dying, toasted batteries or so I recall hearing. Basically, if the controller voltage dipped too low, odd things would happen, and the E-Stops didn’t work properly because the controller would barely get the signal. You’ll notice that the controller is powered directly off of one of the power distribution board ports, with a full breaker.\n\nSo, in the mid 2000s (I want to say 2004 was the first season this happened in), IFI designed in a backup battery port. You’d charge your 7.2V battery, you’d plug it in, and the controller and radio would function enough to get signals and actually shut down properly.\n\nSo why did it go away? When the 8-slot cRIO was introduced in 2009, it came along with a slightly smarter power distribution board. (For anybody that has a blue power distribution panel: Yes, that one.) This particular PDB was built to specifically power the cRIO off of a dedicated branch circuit that ensured that enough voltage was supplied to the cRIO almost regardless of actual battery voltage. When the PDP and PDH and PDP2 came along, every single one of them did the same thing: Put the RIO (of whatever flavor) onto a dedicated power point, which was guaranteed to be the last thing to lose power.\n\nSo, short version: It’s no longer required for safety, because the power distribution board circuitry for powering the robot controller has an equivalent.",

If the battery voltage dropped below about 7 volts for a brief moment, the robot controller would reset and then you’d have to wait for it to come back up and the field to re-connect to it. While these didn’t take as long as the modern RoboRio and VH radio to re-start, you’d have moments with no way to control the robot. This back-up battery made sure your controller wouldn’t reset during those brief voltage drops. You wouldn’t be able to move great when this happened - you wouldn’t have 12 v going to each speed controller and you probably were opening some 40 amp breakers - but you didn’t have to wait for the field to reconnect to each robot.\n\nToday, if you put a cruddy old battery in your robot and try to do something that pulls a lot and causes a voltage drop, look at what happens at your driver station. The RoboRio / driverstation has this brown-out protection built in where it will disable motor outputs if the voltage gets too low. This way it protects itself from resetting (and the subsequent minute or so needed to reconnect) at the expense of your robot moving.\n\nThis software protection does the same thing, and in the end your robot would have the same performance issues if the voltage was allowed to drop below 7 volts but the RoboRio stayed up.",

The price of low-Rds-on MOSFETs and integrated regulator controllers came way down over the 2000s and 2010s.\n\n“Just tack on a second battery” was where the crossover point happened to be at that time.\n\ngurellia53:\n\nI have some fleeting memory of the backup battery also being tied to some specific functionality - maybe servo power?\n\nYes, it provided power to the PWM port power rail, which is where servos connected.
