                    "cooked": "I’ve seen a lot of people talking about CAN wiring. The only technically correct way of wiring is daisy chaining. As most people point out the trunk and branch method works though again not really advisable. Thinking about the new control system coming in 27 I am wondering if they go to CAN FD. If they do I doubt the trunk and branch method will be as successful / could encounter more issues.\n\nThinking forward, as a mentor I really want to make more systems have a plug and play sort of design philosophy. We have some ideas for mechanical and programming that I hopefully post about in the future but for wiring I have had an idea for a while but don’t really know if it is feasible.\n\nEssentially it would be a CAN hub similar to our power distribution. The CAN hub would have the 120 ohm resister and would be the terminator. There would be a connection to the controller (roborio) and there would be connection points for each device. Each connection is actually 4 conductors (2 sets of twisted pairs - One set for outgoing, One set for incoming). This would make the CAN loop fairly long but keep the Daisy Chain. (It looks like you don’t start having issues with length even with CAN FD until your at 40 meters +).\n\nThis would essentially be a star-like configuration but with an actual Daisy Chain bus. This might make wiring easier but it still has the major drawback of single point of failure with the Daisy Chain. So here is where my idea comes in… Can you have the CAN hub check for continuity on the CAN wire and automatically jump the connection of there is none. In essence as soon as you plug in your 4 wire connection the CAN hub sees continuity and adds the device to the loop. Should something happen in a match and continuity is cut so it would automatically remove that device from the loop  until continuity is reestablished.\n\nI’m mechanical so I’m getting a bit outside my wheelhouse here but here are the issues that I am most concerned about. 1 - Can you do a continuity check without effect the CAN signal? 2 - If you switch the device with a MOSFET would the resistance of the MOSFET effect the CAN signal?\n\nI already have something of a solution for both issues but isn’t as elegant as a continuity check with 4 wires and MOSFETs. I could add in a 5th and 6th wire that just check for continuity and would trigger a relay. The major downside is what if just a single wire in the CAN is broken and it isn’t the continuity wire (or the continuity wire is broken but CAN wires are not). Also lots of relays would make the CAN hub rather large and heavy.\n\nI like the idea of using Ethernet connectors like the SWYFT which could potentially allow for redundancy with all 4 wires having a redundant wire (assuming you can check continuity on the CAN wires). If I end up going with a single set of wire just for checking continuity then you would end up with a leftover twisted pair (ethernet has 4 twisted pairs) which could handle low current power like SWYFT.\n\nThe major problem I have with using Ethernet cables is they are usually not motion rated. Over time they will likely have issues (though it could be mitigated with redundant configuration). I think my favorite most bulletproof connection style would be 4 conductor wire with twisted pairs with crimped on ferrules to terminate and connected to the CAN hub using PCB mounted WAGOs.\n\nSomeone with some real electrical/programming chops could even have this CAN hub communicate as a CAN device notifying the controller of a disconnected device which could then allow programmers to have code to deal with non functional devices.\n\nI hope I can get some feedback on this and if everyone seems to think this idea is feasible and worth the effort, I wouldn’t mind some help with execution.\n\nThanks!

First, I’d look around to see if someone has implemented this feature set, and what form it takes. Is it in one of the CAN (or similar bus) standards? In the datasheets of COTS CAN transceiver integrated circuits?\n\nI suspect that the switchable circuit would ideally have to be designed to look transparent to a signal passing through it (i.e. characteristic impedance matched), and non-reflective to a signal dead-ending at it (i.e. terminated). I’m not sure what that circuit would look like with a MOSFET inline, in addition to the mismatch between the 100 Ω characteristic impedance of the twisted pair network cable (e.g. category 5) and its RJ-style terminations, and the 120 Ω CAN transceivers. It sounds like a tractable problem to solve.",

                    "cooked": "BTW I dropped my original post into chat gpt… here is the response for those who are interested. ( @Tristan_Lall I didn’t post your response to chat gpt but based on what chat gpt says your spot on)\n\nHigh‑impedance sensing You can monitor CAN_H and CAN_L with a very high‑impedance divider or buffer (e.g. >1 MΩ), combined with a small bias network, to detect whether the differential pair is intact—without loading the bus. A microcontroller ADC or comparator could watch for the expected idle‑bus voltage (around 2.5 V differential) and flag a break.\n\nAvoiding bus interference Any sensing network must be orders of magnitude higher impedance than the 60 Ω termination so it doesn’t skew bit‑timing or idle levels.\n\nMOSFETs as switches Power MOSFETs typically have on‑resistances in the single‐digit milliohms (e.g. 5 mΩ), which adds negligible DC impedance compared to 60 Ω terminations. However, the MOSFET’s parasitic capacitances (gate‑drain, gate‑source) can introduce reflections at high bit‑rates—especially in the data‑phase of CAN FD at up to 8 Mbit/s.\n\nBetter alternatives Consider using analog switches (e.g. ADG54xx series) or relay drivers designed for high‑speed differential pairs. Their on‑capacitance is usually specified and can be kept under a few picofarads.\n\nStar vs. true daisy‑chain What you’re doing is effectively a star with controlled bypasses , which is fine so long as only one node is inserted between hub A and B at a time.\n\nSingle‑point failure If the hub itself dies, the whole bus is down—so you’ll want redundancy or two hub units per robot, or a watchdog that forces both ends to stay terminated in a fault.\n\nExisting CAN couplers/repeaters Commercial “ CAN bus switches” (e.g. NXP TJA1441, Microchip MCP2562 coupler) already let you isolate faulty segments and keep the rest of the bus alive. You could base your design on one of these.\n\nEthernet vs. M8/M12 • Ethernet (RJ45): 4 pairs, cheap, keyed—but not rated for motion or vibration over long term. • M8/M12 (5‑pin): industry‑standard on industrial robots; they’re screw‑locked, vibration‑proof, and you can buy 5‑pin A‑coded versions that give you CAN_H, CAN_L, +V, GND, plus one spare (for continuity sense!).\n\nTwisted‑pair usage If you add a separate spare pair for “continuity sense,” you avoid ambiguity if one of the CAN wires breaks. You can then still use the fourth pair for low‑current power (e.g. 5 V @ 0.1 A) or a local LED indicator.\n\nHub hardware\n\nTwo 120 Ω termination resistors, switch‑selectable via low‑on‑resistance analog switches.\n\nA microcontroller (e.g. small ARM Cortex‑M) that: Monitors both CAN lines via high‑impedance divider/comparator. Controls the analog switches to bypass a faulty branch. Presents a diagnostics CAN node upstream to report “node X offline” or “bus continuity lost.”\n\nMonitors both CAN lines via high‑impedance divider/comparator.\n\nControls the analog switches to bypass a faulty branch.\n\nPresents a diagnostics CAN node upstream to report “node X offline” or “bus continuity lost.”\n\nFirmware logic\n\nOn plug‑in, test line voltages → close that branch’s switch.\n\nDuring a match if continuity drops → open that branch, notify roboRIO over CAN .\n\nMechanical/design\n\nPCB in a rugged enclosure, WAGO or screw‑terminal PCB headers for quick field wiring.\n\nOptionally, use stranded wire with crimped ferrules rather than ribbon cable—simpler to repair and rated for vibration.\n\nElectrical review: Partner with an EE mentor to finalize sensing resistances, analog‑switch specs, and decoupling.\n\nPrototype: Build a small “2‑port CAN hub” on perf‑board using off‑the‑shelf CAN transceiver, analog MUX, and an Arduino or Teensy.\n\nTest: Verify signal quality on an oscilloscope at 1 Mbit/s and at your chosen data‑phase rate (e.g. 8 Mbit/s). Keep eye‑diagrams clean and confirm bit‑error rates.\n\nYour concept is absolutely doable—and it’s exactly the sort of modular, “smart” wiring system that could make FRC teams’ wiring faster, safer, and more reliable. I’d be excited to help you flesh out the electrical schematic or prototype firmware when you’re ready!",

                    "cooked": "It’s an interesting challenge, but solvable.  The key requirement is that you want the hub to bypass a loop if that loop is not passing CAN messages through it. The bypass detection circuit would check the CAN signals on each side of the loop.  If one side was dominant and the other recessive for at least 1 bit time (>1 microsecond) the detector would trigger. You might lose one CAN message when this happens, but CAN will retry automatically so that’s survivable. Then you’d have a relay or analog switch to disconnect the loop and bypass it.  This needs 6 total switches - two each to open CANH and CANL going to the loop on each side, and two to bypass.  That could all be done by one multipole relay per loop, or with analog switches. Once disconnected / bypassed you’d need a reset method.  maybe that would be a manual process or commanded by software. You’d need N detectors and bypass switches for N loops.  The detector would basically be two CAN transceivers in receive-only mode, some simple logic to compare the two received signals, and a latch circuit to drive the bypass switch.",

The major downside is that you’d have to create a CAN device to work with the RoboRio which is doable but would probably be even more for me to learn / troubleshoot than a dumb device that just checks signals and closes relays / analog switches. In the future though it would be nice to add functionality that would allow the CANHUB to communicate with the RoboRio.",

The key requirement is that you want the hub to bypass a loop if that loop is not passing CAN messages through it. The bypass detection circuit would check the CAN signals on each side of the loop. If one side was dominant and the other recessive for at least 1 bit time (>1 microsecond) the detector would trigger. You might lose one CAN message when this happens, but CAN will retry automatically so that’s survivable. Then you’d have a relay or analog switch to disconnect the loop and bypass it. This needs 6 total switches - two each to open CANH and CANL going to the loop on each side, and two to bypass. That could all be done by one multipole relay per loop, or with analog switches. Once disconnected / bypassed you’d need a reset method. maybe that would be a manual process or commanded by software. You’d need N detectors and bypass switches for N loops. The detector would basically be two CAN transceivers in receive-only mode, some simple logic to compare the two received signals, and a latch circuit to drive the bypass switch.\n\nHow it works: Two receive‑only CAN transceivers monitor the bus on both sides of each stub. If one side ever drives dominant while the other stays recessive for longer than a bit‑time (>1 µs at 1 Mbit/s), you know that segment has gone open.\n\nPros: Uses inherent CAN levels (dominant = 0, recessive = 1) — no extra sense wires. Bit‑time window keeps you from tripping on spurious edges.\n\nUses inherent CAN levels (dominant = 0, recessive = 1) — no extra sense wires.\n\nBit‑time window keeps you from tripping on spurious edges.\n\nCaveats: You need to synchronize your detector clock to the CAN baud (or pick a safe ≥1 μs window at worst‑case clock skew). At higher data‑phase rates (e.g. 8 Mbit/s), that 1 μs threshold actually spans multiple data‑phase bits—make sure your logic still catches bus faults without missing a transition.\n\nYou need to synchronize your detector clock to the CAN baud (or pick a safe ≥1 μs window at worst‑case clock skew).\n\nAt higher data‑phase rates (e.g. 8 Mbit/s), that 1 μs threshold actually spans multiple data‑phase bits—make sure your logic still catches bus faults without missing a transition.\n\nSwitch count: Six throws per loop (CANH and CANL each need “open line” on both sides + “bypass” closure).\n\nImplementation options: Multipole relay : Simple, galvanic isolation—but relatively slow (1–10 ms operate time) and bulky. Analog high‑speed switch IC : Sub‑50 ns settling times, low R ON (single‑digit Ω or less), small footprint. Look at parts like the ADG5412 or similar.\n\nMultipole relay : Simple, galvanic isolation—but relatively slow (1–10 ms operate time) and bulky.\n\nAnalog high‑speed switch IC : Sub‑50 ns settling times, low R ON (single‑digit Ω or less), small footprint. Look at parts like the ADG5412 or similar.\n\nSignal integrity: Ensure your chosen switch’s parasitic capacitance + R ON don’t introduce reflections at your target data‑rate.\n\nLatch circuit: Once a break is detected, your detector logic should “stick” that loop open. A simple SR latch or your microcontroller GPIO can do this.\n\nReset strategies: Manual: Press‑to‑reset button per port (field‑serviceable). Software: Have your roboRIO send a “clear faults” CAN frame that prompts each hub to re‑test and re‑close healthy loops.\n\nManual: Press‑to‑reset button per port (field‑serviceable).\n\nSoftware: Have your roboRIO send a “clear faults” CAN frame that prompts each hub to re‑test and re‑close healthy loops.\n\nDiagnostics: If your hub itself appears as a CAN node, it can publish “Loop #3 open” or “stuck fault” messages back to your driver station.\n\nYou’ll replicate detector + switch blocks N times.\n\nKeep your MCU pin‑count in check by multiplexing: e.g., use an I²C GPIO expander for your switch‑control lines, or daisy‑chain multiple detector ASICs.\n\nChoose your switch technology early (relay vs. analog switch) and order eval boards.\n\nSimulate the detection logic : test your bit‑time threshold on a bench CAN bus (scope the outputs).\n\nPrototype one port : combine a CAN transceiver, analog switch, and small MCU, then exercise open‑loop by unplugging the port mid‑message.\n\nBuild a simple firmware API so “clear faults” can be invoked over CAN .",
