Lots of good resources a google/github search away.\n\nNow here’s a high level breakdown of what I would do:\n\nInitialize your motor controller(s) and a sparkmax pid controller using the leader controller.\n\nConfigure some starting pid constant values. I typically assign a P value to start and leave the others as 0.\n\nWork out the overall reduction in your system from the motor to the travel of the elevator. Essentially you want to work out the relationship between motor turns and distance traveled.\n\nThen you can use that relationship to command the pid to a distance using the SetReference() method with kPosition as the control mode.\n\nI would advise disconnecting the motor, or chain, or whatever can’t spin indefinetly when initially running this on hardware. You want to sanity check that its spinning the right way and making a correct number of turns.\n\nNow start messing with the P, I & D values as needed. Wpilib docs has a good page on that iirc.\n\nCongratulations! You now have a working elevator. Although perhaps a little rough. But don’t worry, there are things we can do to make it nicer.\n\nTo smooth it out you can look into things like feed forwards and motion profiles. The wpilib has built in classes for this. They will require some light reading to get into. But nothing you wont be able to handle.\n\nThere are a lot of other great solutions out there, these are just the initial steps I would take.\n\nIf you post your code, I’m sure others on here will be able to help unblock you quickly. But if you are still stuck by the weekend, send me a PM and we can try and set up a call when I have time to help you out. (I hear the FRC discord is an excellent resource for getting code help. Maybe check there also?)",

If you disconnect the Elevator Spark Max from the Rio (via CAN) you can control it over USB.\n\nI’d recommend setting the current limit to 40-50A (or less) before you start. That will make it harder to smoke the motor.\n\nFrom there, the spark max utility will allow you to change all the Rev parameters that you could in code.\n\nYou can do this in a few ways, but simple position control is the easiest IMO. You can learn to tune from this environment. Here are our parameters for the elevator currently (yours will be different, but this gives you an example).\n\nPXL_20230215_012012981 1920×2550 383 KB\n\nPXL_20230215_012012981 1920×2550 383 KB\n\nPXL_20230215_012012981 1920×2550 383 KB\n\nOnce you know the parameters you like - you can set the in code.",

If you can get one, the REV Through Bore Encoder is a good choice.\n\nThe built-in encoder is not directly measuring the position of the elevator – there are normally gears/belts/chains/whatever, plus possibly something like a winch involved.  And, the built-in encoder doesn’t have a fixed zero reference, so it can be hard to know where it is when things start up (or if the motor controller reboots for some reason).

Take care in if you need to invert them or not.\n\nSetReference is a method on the rev pid controller. You use it to set the position or velocity based on the passed in control mode. Link to the docs: SparkMaxPIDController (FRC-REVLib API)\n\nSo create your “leader” motor controller object. Use that motor controller object to instantiate a pidcontroller object. Init your pid constants and then whenever you want to command it to a position you would call SetReference on the pid controller object.\n\nTake a look at this code example: SPARK-MAX-Examples/Robot.java at master · REVrobotics/SPARK-MAX-Examples · GitHub",
