This is my first post on Chief Delphi and I hope to see my design on other robots as it solved a potential problem this year with Reefscape Coral and its damage potential. Please take a look and as always, constructive feedback is always welcome.\n\nThe Problem\n\nWhen we started to think about how to get the coral from the reef, we noticed that it could deal some damage to the robot, specifically our exposed Rev MaxSwerve components. So I was tasked with making a cover to protect the swerve motors. The requirements for the model are that it must protect the motors from the coral, keep debris from our robot pan, and allow wires to exit the cover without creating wear points and damage them.\n\nHow I Made It\n\nI measured all the Swerve Drive components on our 2025 Bot - Squirt and referenced the REV MaxSwerve stl files on their website to get dimensions and size… My first design was a similar shape to the finished product, but it had less fillets and a thinner shell along with the wire entrance/exit being near the bottom of the pan. This allowed more debris to get into the pan than desired. To fix that, I changed the design so that the wiring entrance/exit would be on the side nearest the interior frame perimeter. I also added some more fillets and a thicker shell to make it visually pleasing and to add structural integrity respectively… Later, I added the team’s name and number to create the finished model you can view below. Finally, I added fillets to where the wires were inserted.\n\nTesting\n\nWe 3D printed several prototype models as we finalized the design. On our next to last print, we started testing. That 3d print run had a filament infill of 50%. Our first test was to drop the coral from 40 inches above the prototype at multiple different angles. The design survived the upright coral drop and the horizontal coral drop with slight marks and minimal damage… With those successful tests, we decided to raise the height to 60 inches to mimic the level 4 reef location and potential coral mishandling at that height. The design took its first damage at an approximately 45 degree angled coral drop from 60 inches with a large gouge and housing crack where the coral impacted the top of the cover.\n\n.\n\nHow we fixed the problem\n\nTo strengthen the design, I changed the infill to 100% infill. Then, I increased the fillet size on the inside to help distribute the impact from the coral. After the changes, we tested it again, only to see that the coral only scratched the design without damage. Then I put it on the chassis and you can see it here\n\nIMG_0728 1920×2560 314 KB\n\nIMG_0728 1920×2560 314 KB\n\nIMG_0728 1920×2560 314 KB\n\nIMG_0730 1920×2560 274 KB\n\nIMG_0730 1920×2560 274 KB\n\nIMG_0730 1920×2560 274 KB\n\nSome Tips\n\nWhen printing this design, print it upside down to preserve filament and we would encourage you to use 75% or greater infill. You may need to clean out the attachment holes with a #10-12 drill bit to be able to more easily put it on the robot.\n\nHere is my design\n\nPlease find my Solidworks Files at the following link.\n\nGoogle Drive file.\n\nSTEP file https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uefgEJfCNqo-jiZPDpJkISjPd6_-hGT6/view?usp=drive_link\n\nClosing\n\nI hope that you will find my design useful for your own robot. Feel free to customize and add your own team name and number. Good luck and let’s Reefscape!",
