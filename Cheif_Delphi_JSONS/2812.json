This means the odometry pose is still allowed to drift over time instead of being gradually fixed by vision measurements. In other words, the odometry is only ever getting fixed by one vision measurement instead of a backlog of all of them.\n\nThe old implementation applied vision updates to old pose estimates, then replayed odometry updates up to the current time. That was too expensive at the time, so idk if we can fix this properly.\n\nThe odometry object pose not being vision-compensated also causes `PoseEstimator.resetRotation()` to make the translation estimate teleport from the vision-compensated version to the odometry-only version.\n\nInitially reported by FRC team 2363:\n\nStep 9 of `PoseEstimator.addVisionMeasurem … ent()` sets the PoseEstimator pose estimate to a vision-compensated version of the latest odometry object pose, but the odometry object's pose is only updated by twists passed to `PoseEstimator.updateWithTime()`.

Reverting to the 2024 version has the “proper” fix (replaying old odometry updates), but it was too expensive for the roboRIO to handle.\n\nThis affects CTRE ’s pose estimator as well, since it’s based on WPILib’s 2025 pose estimator.",

The new twist is basically “how much the odom-to-global transform has moved since the last vision update”, which is the appropriate thing to multiply by Kalman gain.\n\nI think the only thing we’re losing by not updating the odom pose history is the ability to account for the odom-to-global transform not being stationary over time: implicitly, the current implementation is treating vision updates with a zero-order hold: “Aha, I now know the truth is I’ve always been here!” as opposed to “Well, I know I’m here now but a little bit ago I may have been somewhere else”. There can be subtle differences in how you integrate past odometry under different assumptions, but I doubt they are actually consequential in the common case in FRC (vision updates lagging odometry by a couple hundred ms worst case).",
