The price is substantially lower, and they offer volume discounts (20%-40% cheaper than AndyMark). They offer the newly legal CB285-120 model, but not the classic CB185-120. (AndyMark sells both SKUs, but may substitute the CB285 if you order the CB185). https://powerwerx.com/bussmann-cb285-120-circuit-breaker-surface\n\nI like the CB285 because it uses M6 studs instead of 1/4-28 (like the classic CB185), so I don’t have to have any 1/4-28 nuts floating around our shop and getting mixed with the 1/4-20s. The size and hole pattern of the CB285 is a drop-in replacement for the CB185, so no need to re-3d-print breaker covers and whatnot.",

We have removed as many metric tools out of our toolbox as possible to keep the students from using metric allen wrenches and combination wrenches on all the standard hardware on the robot. 99% of the hardware we typically use SAE and not metric. So with that being 6mm It’ll probably take a 13mm wrench which will then be used on a half inch hex head. The bigger problem will be when a student drops one of the nuts and can’t find it then goes and takes a nut off an old breaker they’ll just send it.  Screwing up the threads on the stud as well as the nut. Sorry for the rant but I’ve seen this scenario play out too many times",

Maybe even more likely…\n\nNot really since the only place there are 1/4-28 nuts is on the breakers and the breakers stay in the electrical cabinet. The biggest problem we’ve had with nuts and bolts getting mixed up came from the old head coach buying and using 10-24 hardware to use everywhere on the robots. I finally convinced the new head coach to buy all new 10-32 hardware and remove the 10-24 from use. This year was perfect for it since we only had 1 returning build student that was used to using the 10-24 hardware.",

We tripped ours once at the very beginning of the season before we current-limited everything, and fast-forward a couple months to a qual, the robot turns off mid-match, with the lever STILL PRESSED IN. We turned the bot off and back on, and it worked.\n\nApparently, once these are tripped once, the current they trip at is lowered to a different value. The best guess of the CSAs on site was that we did something (i.e. hit a specific patch of carpet with a specific amt of fuzz in a wheel at a specific angle) that just exceeded that lowered limit, tripping the breaker, with the lever not displaying this trip because our breaker was bad.\n\nSo PSA: Replace your breakers if you trip them at all!

Internally to these breakers, there is a piece of metal that deforms as it heats up… it heats up under load (when current is passing through it).  The amount of time it takes to deform (derived from the temperature it is at for an amount of current being passed through it for that time) is the “trip time”.\n\nAnyway… that metal, like pretty much all metal, has “memory” and once it deforms likes to keep on being deformed so every single breaker on an FRC robot, once tripped, will keep on lowering the value at which it trips.  There is, in theory, an asymptotic relationship here and there is some lower bound to it but… if you’re a team pushing on the main breaker then you’ll be pushing it ever lower.",

When the lead build mentor saw me do it and asked why i informed him of being junk and unreliable. There have been so many parts i have thrown out in the last couple years that were being kept that were questionable wheter they were good or bad including 2 drive station controllers that had major drift and could be used in a pinch. Found out about those at one comp when one was used in a match accidentally and it cost us the match. What made me mad about the controller is the one mentor took it out of the trash and said we will just label it. So i went over took it, and cut the cord off of it and threw it out again. Some things are worth keeping to use if they are questionable but not many.",
