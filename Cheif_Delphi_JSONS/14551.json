                    "cooked": "So at the end of last night’s meeting we installed a Pigeon 2.0 on our robot to try and restore our field centric control (rest of the backstory is here ), and saw some odd behavior.\n\nAt headings of 0 and 180 degrees, everything functioned as expected (i.e. up on the joystick was field-forward, left on joystick was field-left, etc.) but at 90 and 270 degree headings things seemed to get inverted (joystick-left was field-right, joystick-up was field-down).\n\nWe didn’t have much time to try and find a solution, but I did note that when we were previously using a NavX we would return -getAngle for heading, which I did not do with the Pigeon. The above behavior makes me think inverting the gyro value like that may be a fix, but I was wondering if anyone else in the community had seen/dealt with a similar issue, and how you might have solved it.\n\nOur code is located here and I used the FRC 0 to Autonomous swerve example as the base for our drivetrain code.\n\nThanks in advance for any input the community may have!\n\nJosh",
