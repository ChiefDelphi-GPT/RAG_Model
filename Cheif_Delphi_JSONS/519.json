A position PID can be better thought of as a PID with a target velocity of zero. Motion profiles or moving inputs also generate a velocity reference and want you to keep velocity, so asking for a velocity of zero does not make sense. The solution is to pass velocity reference into both your feedforward and feedback controllers, achieving significantly better reference tracking, resulting in the velocity error term you are seeing.  \n\nCTRE uses an S-curve profile, which is a bit harder to implement.  \n\nIts less hard but more tedious as they require a lot more equations but are applied in exactly the same way.  \n\nAs far as I understand, this approach will allow you to follow a non-zero velocity ending trajectory as well, is it true?  \n\nYes. This is how you track moving inputs, but there is a caveat that you must update the velocity and position reference together such that the velocity reference is exactly the first derivative of the position reference. For example, if you want the controller to stay put in one place, the velocity reference must be zero at the end of the controller. If you don’t do this correctly, the system will stabilize somewhere where the kp gains on position and velocity (kd) reach equilibrium.  \n\nI would actually suggest deriving the profiles by hand if you can’t find a good paper describing the math. Math is significantly easier to understand than code in terms of controls.",

To achieve this the position setpoint must correspond to the integral of the velocity setpoint. Abruptly ending this process may not yield the desired results as discussed earlier. The real question is why are you creating a profile with a non-zero end velocity? This is typically done when transitioning between two controllers or setpoints in real-time and aiming to maintain the highest feasible velocity before shifting to the new setpoint. While this approach works universally it's essential to ensure consistency across different applications.",

Since the target point moves with the same velocity as calculated, it likely achieves similar results as understood. However, assuming this is true, it will track the target poorly due to significant phase lag. When near the setpoint, the kd gain tries to decelerate to zero, which isn’t desired. Instead, the system should maintain the desired non-zero velocity, hence requiring the velocity error term.\n\nIt still feels counterintuitive to calculate velocity error from position setpoints. Velocity is the first time derivative of position, and the formula provides a simple discrete method to approximate this derivative.\n\nThe real question is why generate a profile with non-zero end velocity. Common reasons include transitioning between controllers/setpoints in real-time to maintain the highest possible velocity before changing setpoints. This approach generally works reliably unless specific use cases require otherwise.\n\nNotably, achieving velocity continuity is challenging. Poor implementation can lead to velocity discontinuities, causing unpredictable system behavior.",
