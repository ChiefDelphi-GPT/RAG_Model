A position pid can be better thought of as a PID with a target veloicty of zero. Motion profiles or moving inputs also generate a velocity reference and want you to keep velocity, so asking for a velocity of zero does not make sense. The solution is to pass velocity reference into both your feedforwards and feedback controllers, you will achieve significantly better reference tracking, resulting in the velocity error term you are seeing.\n\nlevyishai:\n\nCTRE uses an S-curve profile which is a bit harder to implement,\n\nIts less so hard but more so just tedious as they are are a lot more quations but they are applied in exactly in the same way.\n\nbarkinvar:\n\nAs far as I understand this approach will allow you to follow a non zero velocity ending trajectory as well, is it true?\n\nYes. This is how you track moving inputs, but there is the caveat that you must update the velocity and position reference together such that the velocity reference is exactly the first derivative of the position reference. (e.g if you want the controller to stay put in one place, the velocity reference must be zero at the end of the controller.) If you don’t do this correctly, the system will stabilize somewhere where you don’t want where the kp gains on position and velocity (kd) reach equilibrium.\n\nI would actually suggest deriving the profiles by hand if you can’t find a good paper describing the math. Math is significantly easier to understand than code in terms of controls.",

Since the target point is moving with the same velocity as profile calculated, it is probably going to achieve a similar result as I understand since\n\nlevyishai:\n\n(currentError - prevError) / period = velocityError\n\nbut it still feels counter intuitive for me to calculate the velocity error from the position set points.\n\nAnother thing is that we use velocity feedforward but moteus does not. Wouldn’t it cause the controller to lag behind the target. Do they overcome it by doing torque control instead of voltage control?",

You simply take two points in the graph, find the slope between them and that should be the exact velocity setpoint given by the motion profile. It also handles non-zero velocity profile endings easily; if the rate of change in setpoint is constant and non-zero till the last second, the velocity target will also remain a non-zero constant setpoint.\n\nbarkinvar:\n\nDo they overcome it by doing torque control instead of voltage control?\n\nYeah. Since torque is proportional to acceleration, zero torque should make you stay in your current velocity (if you apply kG, kS and other feed forward terms correctly). kV is used to cancel back-emf (basically the thing that makes motors slow down when the voltage goes down). You could say that just as a “side affect”, it also helps you reach a cruise velocity for voltage control rather than only maintaining it. Because in torque control there is no back-emf (the motor won’t slow down given a zero torque request), a kV wouldn’t really work and would be useless in most cases. If you’ve ever tried to SysId with TorqueCurrent control, you can see it’ll basically return zero for the kV. The kV equivalent for not lagging behind even without a kP for torque control is usually the kA.",

You’ll regardless need to change the position setpoint accordingly to match the integral of the velocity setpoint. If you’d stop only one abruptly, it won’t function as you’d like, as Alex mentioned:\n\nAlex_Y:\n\nIf you don’t do this correctly, the system will stabilize somewhere where you don’t want where the kp gains on position and velocity (kd) reach equilibrium.\n\nThe real question should be; why are you generating a profile with a non-zero end velocity? I’d say the most common case is when switching between two controllers or setpoints in real time, and wanting the first one to try and maintain the highest velocity possible before going to the other setpoint. You might have a use case I haven’t thought of, but it should pretty much always work the same regardless on how you do it.",

Since the target point is moving with the same velocity as profile calculated, it is probably going to achieve a similar result as I understand since\n\nAssuming the first part is true, it will track the target very poorly due significant phase lag. When the system is near setpoint, the kd gain will try to decelerate the system to 0, when that’s not what you want. You want the system to continue at the desired non-zero velocity as dictated by the motoion profile or moving input, hence why the velocity error term is required.\n\nbarkinvar:\n\nbut it still feels counter intuitive for me to calculate the velocity error from the position set points.\n\nVelocity is the first time derivative of position. The above formula is the simplest way to take a discrete derivative.\n\nlevyishai:\n\nThe real question should be; why are you generating a profile with a non-zero end velocity? I’d say the most common case is when switching between two controllers or setpoints in real time, and wanting the first one to try and maintain the highest velocity possible before going to the other setpoint. You might have a use case I haven’t thought of, but it should pretty much always work the same regardless on how you do it.\n\nYes, but it is worth noting that you must have velocity continuity, which is not always trivial. Doing this but not well can result in velocity discontinuities which leads to unpredictable behavior.",
