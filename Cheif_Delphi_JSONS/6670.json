                    "cooked": "To be honest, it depends. On the one hand a gear-driven turret is generally easier to manufacture (especially if you’re making it out of aluminum) though without proper gear design and spacing it can suffer from slop that may affect accuracy at long range.\n\nOn the other hand, a belt-driven turret is generally less susceptible to slop, and thus can be controlled more precisely, but the manufacturing is generally harder (requiring you to either buy or 3D Print a large pulley) and requires more precise spacing to keep the belt tensioned. Belts are also potentially susceptible to skipping which can throw off sensors used to aim the turret.\n\nChain is similar to belts but can be more susceptible to stretching over time, so I’d avoid it personally.\n\nIn general I think I’d prefer a gear-based turret just for the sake of simplicity, assuming you have the fabrication capability for it (they can be 3d printed too but you have to be careful of the durability if you go this route). In general most games that benefit from turrets don’t tend to use them at a range where you have to be super-precise in your horizontal aiming, so a little slop doesn’t hurt that much.\n\nAndrew_L:\n\nGreyT Turret (11\" ID) – WestCoast Products\n\nCOTS is certainly an option too, though we modeled a turret off of this particular design a few years back and had all kinds of issues with it, so it wouldn’t be my first choice, personally.",

                    "cooked": "So Ive done turrets twice for 2451. We loved them, I’m a huge fan and I think they have their place. I have seen many great teams like 254 use gears on most of their turrets and they seem to be happy with them. However we always ran a timing belt. I think that chain should be out of your consideration due to the weight and small translation of distance.  Timing belts are really cool because they allow you to have very little backlash and not have to worry about gear mesh too much. With that said you almost have to use a 3d printer to get this big gear and print in in multiple sections. If you have a markforged or maybe even bambu ur golden, I wouldnt touch it on any other fdm printer. If you dont have either of those go with the gear mesh strategy. If you are 3d printing gears I also encourage you to use a metal insert to add more strength to your hex bores. You will probably round out the hubs if you dont ( I speak from experience). Aside from that bearing methods are a huge thing. Lots of teams use 1 x-bearing in the center of their turret. Go take a look at 2910’s build thread if ur more interested. Ive always used something similar to what you will see in COTS options like the GREY T Turret, but without the top bearings, we made tiny rollers instead. You could also try a low friction material but its all up to you and your teams recources. Cable management is a big component of it too. At the bear minimum use bigus. At the max use a strategy similar to 2451 in 2022. Hope this helps.",

We are having trouble thinking about the wires and such that would need to be rotated. We have looked at slip rings but those usually require them to be centered around the axis of rotation (to my knowledge at least), and that makes game piece manipulation more difficult and time consuming if its not centered.\n\nAs for your questions, when my team was at the 118 open house this year they had a turret prototype out on the table. Ill see if i can find that and post it! It might be really helpful to visualize and demonstrate.",

Personally, I’ve played around with the idea of using a gearing pass-through like how swerve drives run their wheels on a turret, so that way you could mount shooter motors low and keep the turret light, but then you run into the need for (large) custom gearing and it becomes impractical.\n\nThe best solution is probably to just build a 1-full rotation turret (maybe even allow a few degrees of rotation past a full turn if you’re feeling ambitious) and get creative with programming and vision to manage the loop-back positioning.",

First, turrets typically want you to feed gamepieces through their center which is generally incompatible with slip rings. Second, you are not going to find a suitable slip ring that fits within the cots rules. Finding slip rings rated for 40A current, especially on 3+ pairs of wires with an additional 5 pairs of signal wires (1 pair can wires, 4 pairs ethernet) is not cheap. And you don’t need infinite rotation because your drivetrain is not constantly spinning when you are trying to score with whatever is on your turret.",

I posted some more info about this seasons implementation here.\n\nThe CAD of our 2022 robot can be found here and has a very similar turret implementation as this years robot. We epoxied all of the gears to the shafts in the turret gearbox to reduce backlash.",

This also allows you to focus on understanding the turret design by building something that is already known to work properly, and focus on getting the programming and control down, instead of spending your time focusing on making a mechanically robust system.\n\nIf you want to make a custom one afterwards, you can then use the control system you developed for your COTS turret on the custom one. Mechanically, you can design it based on either the WCP one (or whatever COTS turret you decide to pursue), or based of the single large thin section bearing style that 118/254/etc. uses.",

System dynamics significantly overpower any methods of trying to work around slop, with the only way of taming them is to eliminate the slop entirely.\n\nShooters involve extremely high forces and those reaction forces have to go somewhere. For a poorly built turret, it goes into recoil and deflecting the entire assembly which causes shots to miss. Slop or backlash in any form also makes controlling the turret’s position significantly more annoying if often not impossible because as disturbances coming from the drive train are able to influence the shooter’s position and that position control on systems with backlash is extremely annoying if not possible.",

It’s driven by a 10DP gear, supported by a big X-contact bearing (source from Lilybearing) and clamped sort of like an SDS modules bearing, pretty straightforward.\n\nTorrence talked about it here .\n\nAlso, these days you can actually get a bit better backlash by using 20DP gears (instead of 10DP) and getting a service like Fabworks to lasercut the big gear profile. When doing this it’s a good idea to order 2x 1/8 thickness aluminum and stack it because the tolerance will be better than a single piece of 1/4.\n\n4414 did that on their turret this year, notice the seam between the plates and the 20dp gear pattern. 0118E72D-C3A9-4E67-8278-9FE6DCECAE5D_1_102_o 1536×2048 378 KB\n\n0118E72D-C3A9-4E67-8278-9FE6DCECAE5D_1_102_o 1536×2048 378 KB\n\n0118E72D-C3A9-4E67-8278-9FE6DCECAE5D_1_102_o 1536×2048 378 KB",
