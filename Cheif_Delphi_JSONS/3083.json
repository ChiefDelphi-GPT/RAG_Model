Energy chain wiring is hard to accomplish if you are wiring it for the first time, and we lost 1 week because of it. Label all of the wires going into the energy chain as you move forward and be careful when you try to squeeze the cables into it, they can get damaged very easily because of the nature of the energy chain. For the labeling, I highly recommend marking the ends of the wires with electric tapes or zipties, so that you know which red and black cables are couples.",

You can make it work, but it requires even more mechanical design work and precision.  See: 2910’s 2023 robot; the energy chain was kept under tension.\n\nAlso, the energy chain you received in the kit is pretty limited in how much wire it can carry.  You might be able to squeeze 2x 14 AWG super-flexible wires into it, maybe add 2x 22 AWG for signal too, but you can’t put 2x 12 AWG 19-strand wires into it and expect it to work, let alone more.  The size of the opening is not the carrying capacity of the chain, and if you overfill it, you will start popping the joints on links.  Bigger stuff is available, though – check McMaster, for instance .\n\nIf you are new to running electrical wiring up elevators, consider coiled cable .  It’s not as elegant, and it’s not inexpensive, but it’s more forgiving.",

We are using Igus E14 series this year after having used E08 series in 2023. The E08 series started breaking down later into the season.",
