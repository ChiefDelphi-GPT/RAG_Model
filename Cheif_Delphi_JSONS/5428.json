                    "cooked": "I recently learned our program is likely to get a donation of $75k with a high degree of flexibility on how it is spent. Obviously, this is both a dream scenario for a team, and one which is rare, so I want to ensure I’m a good steward of this gift.  The desire is to grow our capabilities and student opportunities and create a foundation for a long-term successful program.\n\nA pillar of our team is in-house, student led design and fabrication. As a team, we’re keen on simple, robust designs that make heavy use of tube/gusset design architecture. This strategy has been successful for us over the past three seasons, qualifying us for worlds each year. Our lab space is relatively limited - we have about 700ft² , and no practice field - but the ability to do with the space as we please. We’ve used both SolidWorks and Onshape, and at this time, we’re more likely to use Onshape in coming seasons\n\nWe currently have access to the following:\n\nSubstantially upgraded/modified X-Carve Router\n\nWazer Desktop Waterjet\n\nA Grizzly g0752 Lathe\n\nA PM45 mill used manually\n\nBambu Carbon X1 FDM printer\n\nAssorted hand and small shop tools\n\nCustom Pit/trailer that has served us well since 2022\n\nOur largest pain point is the router; with jigs and kludges, we’ve been able to get it to make what we need, but it’s a major chokepoint in our process, and fabrication takes weeks, limiting programming and drive teams from working with the robot. A large part of the money will be spent to upgrade that tool.  This serves as my first critical question: what machine(s) would you recommend for student-accessible, reliable, and fast aluminum extrusion machining? Our general largest pieces would be drive rails, at 28\" of travel.  A secondary use case would be large pieces of aluminum plate, generally 1/8\"  thick.  Smaller, high precision parts will continue to be made on the waterjet, and polycarbonate likely still on the xcarve.\n\nMy background is in meteorology (clouds, not metrology), and all my machining knowledge is self-taught. My mentors have varying manual machining experience, but not much CNC experience. I’m willing to learn masterCAM or other solutions so I can teach students, but a tool which is forgiving is key to me, as well as allowing students to run it when possible.\n\nI understand the decision will likely come to mill vs router; since I have (limited) router experience, I am drawn towards routers (especially with automatic tool changing) but willing to hear a mill is better suited. If you were to buy a router, how do you set up for easy extrusion manufacturing?\n\nA machine will not likely cost the entirety of this gift, and I’m curious how you’d spend the remaining money to help create a more accessible, competitive program .  I do not have access to a space large enough to house a full field perimeter, though may be able to create a temporary half-field each year - this is something undetermined.",

We personally don’t have either an cnc mill or an omio but the wcp tube jig is known to be good for workholding tubes. By small shop tools I hope you mean you have drill presses and chop saws and things like that. If you don’t then get those. If you don’t need to spend all that money immediately then you could just keep it to help with registration and travel costs for the next few years. Your shop space seems good enough for 90% of needs for an average frc team. Finally, there isn’t a point to buying all these fancy tools if you don’t have sufficient training. Based on the fact it takes weeks to manufacture things you might need to train students better or learn the limits of the machine. Though that depends on if the machine is limiting or experience is.",

Routers excel at making 2.5D parts from flat stock using a flat bottom endmill of a single size typically; robot driverails basically count as that. At most, you’ll have a single tool change per FRC part for a small diameter hole or something.\n\nMany very nice routers do not have tool changers or even a provision to add that, but don’t let that significantly deter you. I wouldn’t pay more than 10% of the machine’s base price to add a toolchanger to a router.\n\nThe most important thing you can do for any NC machine is document the workflow extensively. Make a slide deck that shows every part of making a CAD file into a real part. It might take a week, but will save weeks of people figuring things out on their own, or the machine falling into disuse at worst.",

You have two options there, win the event or win Impact/ EI .\n\nComing from a team that specializes in Impact, you can pretty easily build up outreach that will get you to worlds. You should set aside a portion of the funds for outreach activities, such as helping local teams with registration, run free summer camps for those who need it, etc. That money will also be great to start a preseason/offseason event with so you don’t have to wait for registrations to come in before purchasing.",

                    "cooked": "I think routers and lasers are the way to go with 95+% of FRC parts.  Mills are expensive and have much smaller working volumes.  They are great if you want to make small precision parts like your own custom swerve modules, but if you build tube and gusset and mainly 2d parts routers will get your most all you need.  Especially with all of the COTS items available now.\n\nI would likely get two routers.  One set up for flat pieces one set up with a permanent tube jig that could do smaller flats on a portion of its bed.\n\nWe have a Shop Sabre 23 and it is a great machine and is a good size for most FRC parts.  The larger format ones would be nice for making game field elements, but we have access to one and rarely use it, and I don’t think they are worth it for the price they add.  I would rather be able to be machining on two separate machines simultaneously for about the same price.  I do not think I would bother with a tool changer.  We use the same bit for everything for the most part.\n\nI would also get a good laser to do super-fast wood prototypes and plastics if you have a good way to extract the air and vent it. Recommended laser cutters for FRC? - #4 by AllenGregoryIV\n\nThen if good looking robots are a priority to your team a good powder coating oven and power coating equipment.",

                    "cooked": "+1 for laser cutter. Thunder Laser has been great to work with and offers a great machine at an awesome price point. The laser cutter can completely overhaul your prototyping workflow, hands down.\n\nI would lean towards a router over a mill, but you can definitely do better than an Omio (and that’s a high bar!) on your budget. Personally I’d go towards a 4 by 4 foot Laguna Swift, with the upgraded spindle. You can then bolt the WCP tube jig to the side of the work surface for any tube milling. This setup has served us great the last couple of years and will probably run you somewhere in the 14-18K range. Shop Sabre has been mentioned and is also great in my experience but the value proposition might not be quite as good.\n\nIn terms of other lab stuff, it seems like you are already set up really well. I might suggest a high-quality miter saw with a blade specd for aluminum as these can get you to perfect (within FRC tolerance) tube cut lengths with essentially no post processing. Combined with punched tube you can cut major hours off machining time.\n\nIf you’re still looking for stuff to spend grant money on you could look at a Fuse machine from Formlabs for somewhere in the 20-30K range, its SLS parts are really unparalleled. We’ve been looking at it and although it’s a little out of reach for us the potential is huge. I’m sure @Joe_Johnson can speak to this",

Available as a set of three or a single fixture plate. Measurements: 26\" x 51.5\" x 0.92\" (overall set size) or 26\" x 15.56\" x 0.92\" (single plate size). Plates are matched to +/-...\n\nPrice: USD 829.00\n\nWe have our ATC loaded up with:\n\nshort 4mm single flute\n\n5mm drill\n\n21 drill\n\nchamfer/debur tool\n\nLong 2 flute 1/4 and 3/8 from https://www.lakeshorecarbide.com/longflutelengthcornerradiusroughfinishgeometry-2.aspx for sizing tubing and pocketing both sides in 1 setup\n\nWe also use their passive probe for zeros, unfortunately it’s not wireless and doesn’t fit in the atc: Tormach Probes and Metology - Passive Probe - Probe Only - SKU 50355\n\nThen we add/replace tools as needed for special projects like thread milling or different small hole sizes. With this setup we chew through 1/8\", 1/4\" and 3/8\" aluminum 6061 plate, tubes, 1\" thick 6061 blocks for tube plugs, and we put in a vertical er32 collect and use it as a “lathe” to do custom press fit hex shaft with 7075.\n\nFor work holding we use the saunders vises for tubes and solid blocks for tube plugs, and then the glue and tape method for plate on top of an mdf/aluminum wateboard bolted to our fixture plate, you can also pull a vacuum through the fixture plate/mdf wasteboard if needed.\n\nFor CAM we use Fusion 360.\n\nIf you have any questions about it or looking for pics or anything just let me know!\n\nEdit: Here’s a link of some pics/vids of it in action from this past season https://photos.app.goo.gl/gmNW2fVJWCTvvB6j7",
