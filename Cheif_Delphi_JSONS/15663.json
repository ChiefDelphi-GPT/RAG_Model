It all started when I tried to access the CAN Network using the USB-C connection in the REV Hardware Client. I could see all the devices in the CAN network, but the Client told me the REV devices needed updates. When I tried to update them, the update failed, so I looked at the signal lights for the PDH. It looked like they were blinking orange and magenta which would suggest a Device Over Current error (according to REV documentation). We had a second REV PDH that we plugged into the battery with no other cables attached to it but the one to the battery. The second PDH then blinked orange and blue which would suggest Low Battery. We unattached all the wires from the first PDH and did the same test on it, and it still blinked orange and magenta using the same battery. Unfortunately, this was done this Saturday, so REV support does not have office hours today (I called to see). Any ideas on what could be the problem would be helpful. Thank you.",

I’m not sure exactly if this was the problem or not, but it seems to be the most logical option since our electrical layout was the same. I would suggest that making sure you are in administrator be explicitly mentioned in the documentation because I think the app might not have been running as administrator as I opened it from the installer.\n\nOnce again, thank you all for your help and have a great rest of the season.",

However, I just realized that I should have been more specific to the error I was getting that wouldn’t let me update the software in the first place. REV Hardware Client said that it failed to write on the PDH ’s disk. Before I tried to update the PDH , the Hardware Client knew that the software was out of date. Afterward, the Client said that the version was unknown. Could I have erased the factory default firmware without replacing it because of a failed write?\n\nHow much disk space did you have remaining? Administrator-level permissions shouldn’t be required.",
