                    "cooked": "The magicbot framework does different things depending on whether it runs in the Teleop/Auto and Test modes. The differences I have found to be most jarring are that on_enable / on_disable are not called in Test, and magic resetables don’t run when you are in Test. Is there a deliberate design philosophy I am missing for why these things don’t also run in Test?\n\n4774 has found these to be some of the most natural interfaces for ensuring the robot behaves nicely on initialisation or between control loops. This works fine for the beginning of our season, where we tend to use teleop for simple prototyping. It becomes an issue when we use Test mode for more specific calibration and testing routines. The robot either doesn’t initialise the same way or reset properly between loops in Test compared to Teleop/Auto.\n\nOne example of using will_reset_to is for motor setpoints. Many simple voltage-driven mechanisms tend to want to reset to doing nothing once an arbitrary operation is completed. I think it makes sense to reset the setpoint to zero using the will_reset_to interface between control cycles, so simple magic components can have a single interface method for making a thing happen while a controller input is received and stop automatically when done. This interface can also play nice with magicbot statemachines commanding a thing each control cycle, and the magic component having some concept of a default configuration it wants to return to if that state machine is interrupted/finishes/wants to do something else. These interfaces all break in Test mode, where the magic resetables don’t run. An easy workaround is to manually default it back to something at the end of execute , but it makes will_reset_to seem unnecessary at that point.\n\nThe on_enable and on_disable seem like they should be run in Test. To me, the most natural usage of these methods is resetting a seriously wound-up TrapezoidalProfile so a robot doesn’t try to track something on enable aggressively. The workaround here is to start doing things in disabled periodic to stop the wind up manually, but that’s nasty IMO because it breaks a component’s encapsulation if it should be in charge of “safing” itself on initialisation.\n\nIs there some intent behind the way things are, and should we be doing things differently? Or, is this unintended behaviour, and can we add these things to Test mode in the future?",
