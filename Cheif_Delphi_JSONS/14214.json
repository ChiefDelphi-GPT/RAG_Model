We are currently running the limelight off of a network switch that is powered from the VRM and connected to the radio with the Rio being ran on the radio’s primary port. We initially needed the switch since we were going to add another camera and we wanted to avoid the second port on the radio as we heard it is not reliable. At this point we are unsure if the problem is with the second port of the radio being finicky and messing with our communication with the Limelight or if it is due to the network switch (whether it be power or connection)\n\nThank you",

So I don’t think it’s the second radio port that’s your problem.  According to marshall, that problem manifests itself as the device in the 2nd port simply not connecting to the network when you power up the robot.\n\nWe have a second HD-3000 “driver cam” plugged into the limelight USB port.  Both the limelight image and the driver cam stream to our dashboard side by side.\n\nDo you have a driver cam plugged into the limelight USB port?  Another thread on here suggested this was the root cause of the limelight cutting in and out, and suggested installing PhotonVision on the limelight as a work-around.",

We don’t think it is power related since our limelight does not seem to be doing its reboot sequence. This seems to be a short loss of data (like maybe 5 seconds) then it’s back. We are getting this issue randomly, but it is very frequently. We are getting it ~ once a minute.\n\nOriginally we had the limelight plugged into the 2nd port on the Radio.\n\nOn Saturday we decided to instead go with the switch solution that Marshall and team 900 suggested, and we now have the Rio and Limelight both on a network switch, and then go out to the radio.\n\nWe will see if this fixes our issue. We were originally going to plug a USB camera into the Limelight, but have decided not to with all the other issues that are reported.",

We use a new LL 2; that may differ from LL 1.\n\nDon’t power a LL 2 from a regulated power supply. The students keep thinking more regulators are good and insisted on connecting the BrainBox and the LL to a VRM.  That isn’t right!  One regulator per power circuit to a device, please, and the BrainBox and LL already have that one regulator builtin.\n\nThis year we used the radio primary  Ethernet port for the BrainBox switch and everything else goes into the BrainBox.  First year we didn’t have comm problems.\n\nThe LL 2 document warns of comm disconnects; even the image previewer in the LL config program hangs! We tried the browser interface they say not to use and indeed it disconnects randomly within seconds to minutes.  They warned us!  Auto reconnection software is required as they stated.  We use the WPILib ShuffleBoard and that does reconnect fairly quickly.\n\nWe used the LL USB port for a driver cam without incident.\n\nWe used the LL 2 POE feature and only once did the LL 2 fail with power off and wiggling a wiring connector revived it.  We know what that problem was! (Does anyone know how to inspire kids to think making good crimps is fun?)",
