Our team has been trying to make a more robust software team (going up from 1 mentor and ~1.5 students to like 8 students now ), but we are struggling to figure out how best to do version control for FRC .\n\nLast season, we had one main branch, to which we pushed code (tested or untested), then made branches for each of our events. During this offseason, I created a branch for offseason but the challenge of managing tested/untested code still persists.\n\nThis summer (we are a community team), I have been having the students create branches for features (e.g. swerve, elevator, end effector, auto-align, etc.) and then using pull requests to merge those changes into the main branch. If this is implemented during the season, we would likely still have the new branches at comp.\n\nI recently saw on 581’s CAD and Code Release Thread that they use Github Issues to add changes to plan and track their work, which I think looks pretty neat but I haven’t used it before.\n\nIf you would like to share how your team organizes your code, makes it readable for new students, prevent untested and tested code mingling, and any other version control tips, that would be awesome!",

We don’t have anything in progress because our season is over and I’ve been slacking on organization (it’s pretty much just me over the summer), but it gives a good idea of how it works in the season. We only use the “backlog” part because it has enough features for us.\n\nThis is definitely not all you can do through Projects, but it was really helpful in terms of organization to get an idea of what we need to get done.\n\nWe used a protected main branch were any PRs into the branch (direct pushes are disabled) had to successfully run ./gradlew build to allow to be pushed. I’d be interested in code formatting checks as well in the future as well.\n\nIn the future, I’d also advise that you know the GitHub language to use in a PR, for example, that indicates that it closes an issue. For example, writing:\n\nin a PR’s description automatically creates a link to that issue ( #34 ) and when the PR is merged, the issue is automatically closed, which is neat.",

                    "cooked": "For managing code, we do a few things:\n\nI, as the mentor, claim ownership of “main” for merging. Main should always be “known good code”.\n\nStudents are added to the same git repository with standard write access perms, and they can make or check out branches as needed. (Github Teams is great for this: Just make a new team each season, add users, give team perms)\n\nWhen their code is “Done”, and they want to merge it we do a code review: The students explain to me, what their code does, how it works, and I can help confirm it’s well formed, and tell them if i spot any bugs or points of concern. When possible, we demonstrate it on the bot. If they can’t explain it, we don’t merge it; we plan a rewrite to code they do know, and/or go over concepts they missed. Copy-pasted code usually gets caught here.\n\nOnce reviewed, we merge Main into their branch, and we resolve merge conflicts and test. If it goes well (and tests properly!) I’ll then I’ll pull their branch into main, or OK them to do it.\n\nOnce it’s merged, encourage them to make a new branch and keep going. This helps reduce long-lived branches.\n\nFor rookie students, I always encourage them to do code reviews frequently, usually whenever they’re ready to commit something. This gives a chance to pull code back toward well formed, readable, and more maintainable code. Reviewed code is readable code.\n\nALWAYS find a way to walk each student through some merge conflicts. They’re very scary the first time you run into them, but once students understand Git just needs a helping hand to get the code working properly, they’re very empowered and can start handling merges on their own, which is awesome.\n\nAnd, of course, teach them to merge other branches when needed! Git doesn’t need to go through main. Especially early in the season, nothing is well-tested enough it goes to main, but sometimes one subsystem needs another subsystem to be minimally functional. This gets students working together, communicating and avoids duplicate work. This also makes your commit graphs fun\n\nAlso teach them about how to do “hunk commits” to add just small subsets of code (a few lines/functions at a time) rather than everything in a file.\n\nThere’s also one philosophical thing I always try to push on them: A commit should aim to be a good waypoint they can reference. Forming a commit is a great time should be a time to step back from from quickly hammering out code and reviewing what their new code for correctness. It only takes a couple bugs spotted before the value of this sinks in, and contributes a lot to a good, clean project.\n\nFrom experience, we’ve also made a few specific decisions to (in general) avoid making a complete mess of our entire git workflows.\n\nDon’t commit code that doesn’t compile!\n\nDon’t commit code that you haven’t ran and conformed works.\n\nIf you must violate those rules, start the commit with WIP so it’s clear what’s happening\n\nWhen we start the season, we create the planned subsystems and stub the expected interfaces before anyone branches out. This significantly reduces merge conflicts, particularly when you start adding buttons in robotContainer.\n\nDon’t name branches after nouns like “intake” or “swerve”. You’ll never get rid of them as some students will sometimes mentally link “subsystem” and “branch”. This causes a lot of long-lived branches as they switch to it to “work on the intake”. It also can lead to very siloed work that never interacts outside that subsystem. Instead, name it something with an end goal (auto align, lob-shots, shot-passing…) that indicate when the branch is done, can be merged, and forgotten. For subsystem bringup, we describe as such with “elevator/bringup”; Once it’s up, you’re done.\n\nGenerally, exactly one competition branch at competitions, and nominally one computer. At this time, the robot is nominally under a relative feature freeze, and the code+bot are tied together for performance, fixes, and workarounds.\n\nFor tooling, we keep it simple. I teach them the basic git commands, how to do them in the terminal, and use git graph vscode plugin for visualization. That’s my single favorite git tool, and we use this a ton. We specifically avoid most GUI tools Github Desktop and VSCode’s “sync” button; I’ve found this type of GUI tool often try to do complex git processes and/or multiple git steps at once, and if they go wrong in certain ways it can do stuff like push non-compiling code, or just leave a branch or repo in an extremely annoying state. I’d rather just teach everyone to do fetch/pull/fix and then push it back up in a fixed state.",

I love all the visualization tools and the assignments feature looks rly helpful with a bigger team. Just to clarify, Issues are like “tasks” that need to be done, then you would make a new feature branch, make sure the code in that branch works, then close the issue, right? However, as @Dan1 mentioned, did you guys have any issues (no pun intended) using GitHub Projects, while (presumably) the CAD/Build/Marketing/Etc. teams used something else? Or was that, in practice, not a huge issue?\n\ntherekrab:\n\nWe used a protected main branch\n\nI didn’t even know this existed! Very cool, will get in contact with my mentor about this. I don’t really do programming outside of FRC , so GitHub is very novel to me.\n\nMikeC:\n\nmaking releases when certain milestones are hit\n\nThis is also something we might look into, especially for newer students I think it would be nice to know how the dev process is coming along, and making sure that we can always backtrack if needed to a more stable version.\n\ntekdemo:\n\nMain should always be “known good code”.\n\nSam948:\n\nalways keep…your main branch as a “known good”\n\nThis is helpful to keep in mind for the future.\n\ntekdemo:\n\ncode review\n\nI think this will definitely be helpful, especially with new AI tools; I’ve seen some of the newer students be a little heavy-handed with GitHub Copilot to solve their swerve PID issues ( Did not go well ).\n\ntekdemo:\n\nThis helps reduce long-lived branches.\n\nDo you guys keep branches from competitions? It’s something our team has done, but idk if it’s standard (in FRC /in general) or not.\n\ntekdemo:\n\nreadable code.\n\nWe do like readable code!\n\ntekdemo:\n\nteach them to merge other branches when needed\n\nThis is something that I didn’t know how to solve, but I should’ve probably thought of this before . Those commit graphs look wild!\n\ntekdemo:\n\nstart the commit with WIP\n\nThis is definitely something we will implement going forward; looks suuuper helpful especially during szn when commits are happening somewhat willy-nilly\n\ntekdemo:\n\nname it something with an end goal\n\nThat’s another thing that I was struggling with when going with the new students, as I was worried they would only work on their thing.\n\ntekdemo:\n\nGUI tools Github Desktop and VSCode’s “sync” button\n\nThis is interesting; will definitely keep this in mind.\n\nDan1:\n\nMonday for task management\n\nSomewhat off-topic, but did you guys use Monday for all of your subteams? If so, did that noticeably help with communication between subteams (e.g. tech binder and the like)?\n\nIf you couldn’t tell I’ve learned how to quote posts, sry for the quote spam",

You can delete branches, but we don’t. It’s nice to see the work reflected in the network graph, even if the particular changes never get merged back. Sometimes that will happen for exploratory work, or if the robot changes underneath them rendering it moot. For the most part, the changes from competitions get pulled into our main branch and we swap out to a new branch, leaving a “comp/nameofcomp” branch sitting in the network tree as a reference point.\n\nI think this will definitely be helpful, especially with new AI tools; I’ve seen some of the newer students be a little heavy-handed with GitHub Copilot to solve their swerve PID issues ( Did not go well ).\n\nI specifically turn Copilot off in the Project settings for our main code, which will keep it out of your bigger projects; We use school owned laptops, and also have Copilot set to off globally there too. You might also be interested in the setting for “Java: Guess Argument Names” , which you should probably set to “insertParameterNames”. The default is “Insert Best Guessed Argument”, which either A) inserts a random variable with the right type, or B) inserts null. It causes the code to compile, but almost never actually make sense. For new students, this tends to insert sneaky bugs, particularly if they’re stressed,  distracted, or under time pressure. InsertParameterNames, in contrast, uses the argument names defined by the library author. With good naming patterns they’re often right (eg, “motor”, “angle”, etc), but in other cases it’s a compiler error, with a descriptive name that students can easily resolve. This is my most hated setting in VSCode because it actively sidesteps the benefits of good name convention and the type system.\n\nThis is also something we might look into, especially for newer students I think it would be nice to know how the dev process is coming along, and making sure that we can always backtrack if needed to a more stable version.\n\nJust as a word of note: While releases (and more broadly, git tags) are nice, robots are somewhat moving targets for code. So “code works” depends on factors git itself can’t capture. If your team is anything like ours the bot is under constant modification; So rollbacks might function, but strip out a lot of important hardware-related fixes and tweaks. Or worse, it won’t work at all or cause damage. So, a rollback then leads to a bunch of rework to get back critical changes. Instead of planning for the rollback, just keeping “main” in a good state is way better. If that’s always something you can pull safely, you can easily put bugfixes there and all branches should be able to pull them in later.\n\nAlso helpful: You do not need to check out a branch or a tag; You can just check out a commit by it’s hash, and then create a branch from it. A “branch” is just a pointer to a commit, and almost anything you can do with branches can be done with a commit hash directly, reducing the need to keep strict records beyond the tree and commit descriptions. Tags/releases in contrast, are also pointers to a specific commit, but immutable.",

Here are a few additional things that our team does that has been beneficial that I’ve copied and pasted from our team’s reference docs.\n\nUsing the Event Deploy for WPILib VS Code extension is critical at all competitions. From its description:\n\nA VSCode extension for quickly committing all changes before deploying robot code. Click “Deploy Robot Code (Event)” in the editor menu. The current branch must begin with “event” (e.g. “event_nhgrs”). After an event, these commits can be squashed and merged to another branch. This is intended for use with AdvantageKit. Replaying the code based on a log file requires that the same version of code is running in the simulator. We record the Git SHA as metadata in the log file; by making a new commit before every deploy, this extension guarantees that there are no uncommitted changes.\n\nAs explained above, in order for this extension to provide the traceability that we want at competitions, we need to create an event branch for each competition (e.g., event_midwest).\n\nthis reduces merge conflicts and commit clutter by ensuring that all differences are due to code changes and not formatting\n\nconfigure Spotless based on WPI docs (just the Spotless Configuration section) specify a version of 6.12.0 in the plugins section of build.gradle: id ‘com.diffplug.spotless’ version ‘6.12.0’\n\nspecify a version of 6.12.0 in the plugins section of build.gradle: id ‘com.diffplug.spotless’ version ‘6.12.0’\n\nid ‘com.diffplug.spotless’ version ‘6.12.0’\n\nenable Spotless extension add the following to the .vscode/settings.json file in the VS code project\n\nCreate a draft pull request. In GitHub Desktop, select the Branch → Create Pull Request menu item Select “Create Draft Pull Request” to specify that the pull request is not yet ready to be pulled into main. This can be done as soon as the branch is created. You don’t need to wait until you are ready to have the code reviewed.\n\nIn GitHub Desktop, select the Branch → Create Pull Request menu item\n\nSelect “Create Draft Pull Request” to specify that the pull request is not yet ready to be pulled into main.\n\nThis can be done as soon as the branch is created. You don’t need to wait until you are ready to have the code reviewed.\n\nWhen ready to request that a branch is pulled into main, first sync main and then merge from main into the branch. This ensures that there won’t be any merge conflicts when accepting the pull request and that all the code that will be in main has been tested. In GitHub Desktop, select the Branch → Update from main menu item resolve any merge conflicts test everything\n\nIn GitHub Desktop, select the Branch → Update from main menu item\n\nresolve any merge conflicts\n\ntest everything\n\nMark the pull request as ready to review\n\nBefore a pull request into main is accepted, it is reviewed by a mentor or software lead All code should follow the team’s conventions. formatting should be enforced by Spotless There should be no warnings or suggestions. including warnings or suggestions from SonarLint\n\nAll code should follow the team’s conventions. formatting should be enforced by Spotless\n\nformatting should be enforced by Spotless\n\nThere should be no warnings or suggestions. including warnings or suggestions from SonarLint\n\nincluding warnings or suggestions from SonarLint\n\nWhen the Pull Request is ready to be approved: the changes should be squashed and merged: CleanShot 2025-08-15 at 12.41.36 871×333 121 KB and the explanation should summarize all changes made: CleanShot 2025-08-15 at 12.41.54 864×197 32.8 KB This keeps the commit history in the main branch clean.

We tried it for like a week early on, but end of practice and compiling has no correlation to stable or bug-free code. Having only one branch also removes the value of being able to isolate code for validation and testing; You’re testing everyone’s changes at once. The worst part though, is that any introduced bugs now go to everyone right away, meaning several people must fix it independently to do their work. Now you have 2-5 different solutions, which are either handled via word of mouth, copy-pasting, or constant re-pulling of main, and likely resulting in merge conflicts one way or another. The Git flow here notably fails because you can’t pull from Remote when there’s a conflict with uncommitted code, so you’re doing a lot more work to manage code overall, and making stash/temp commits to deal with it. Since you can’t push code that induces commits at end of day, you also have to pull and resolve all these merges first, right when everyone is tired and trying to go home. It’s really throwing git in the way of efficient coding, rather than using git to up efficiency. Branching lets students handle features at their own cadence, finish testing before other people get it, and handle merging/management strategies at a more suitable time than wrapping up a practice.",

I’ll add one more suggestion, which is what we do: each student forks the team repo and works mainly out of their fork.\n\nThey can use multiple branches in their fork if they want (most don’t).  Mentors review and merge PRs into the team repo.  There are three main benefits of using forks over branching the main repo:\n\nThey’re disposable:  if a student really messes it up, they can just delete it, and they won’t pollute the team repo in any way.  So students can take bigger risks.\n\nIt separates student contributions.  When we used to use branches, nobody cared whose account was being used, so there was no way to tell which student actually wrote anything.  With a per-student fork it’s easy to see what each student is working on.\n\nWhen we used branches, the students would make a ton of them, and immediately forget about most of them, so the repo was in a constant state of merge hell.  If a student really just has one fork branch, they tend to act more like an “owner”.\n\nThere certainly is a bit more overhead (the PR review), it makes fine-grained collaboration much harder (the sharable work unit is a PR, not a commit), and sometimes work at comp can be fraught (students push from their fork).",
