One problem that we are running into is when we try to run a path that comes back to its original position it is not where the robot started. We have tried running the path at various different speeds and we are running the Rev MaxSwerve drivetrain. Here is a video example of what I am talking about: The Path\n\nWhat happens\n\nI have tried to tweak a lot of little things, but the path is always off by about the same amount(which is usually a bit more than seen in the video I provided). As seen in the video as well, the white outline of the actual odometry seems to overlap with the gray outline of the desired odometry which makes me believe that maybe the odometry drifted(but how can I account for or compensate for this?). Here is the code that I am using(It currently uses a SwervePoseEstimator but also have used normal SwerveDriveOdometry): github\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated, and if anyone else has had any issues like this please let me know how you have approached these problems.",

You can pass in these estimates to the SwervePoseEstimator with the “AddVisionEstimate” method.\n\nThough I do agree that you seem to see about a foot of drift in the -x direction here, which seems like too much for odometry over this time period. I would recommend running in teleop and manually driving the robot back and forth to the same location and seeing if its estimated position drifts as well.\n\nDefinitely look at your pose estimation/odometry though, PathPlanner is doing the right thing here, as you said. It can only work with the information provided to it.",

I also think pigeon’s heading estimation works quite well out of the box.\n\nAs I said, the key thing to test is to see if the drift occurs when you just drive straight forward and then straight back without the wheels swiveling.\n\nIf this works fine, then that means the error is coming likely from synchronization issues between your turn encoders and your drive encoders.\n\nMaybe someone on CD with more experience with Rev MaxSwerve could provide some insight.\n\nAlso, I am now noticing that your planned path seems to have a very abrupt jump as it makes the last turn. I don’t expect this would do anything bad to the odometry but could be something to look at reducing.",

The default velocity encoder filtering settings on the spark max are bad, and average a large number of infrequently taken samples. I would add\n\nto swerve module’s constructor.\n\nIt also looks like something’s weird with your paths, since the target pose jumps after the first path. Is the starting pose of the second path the same as the ending pose of the first path?\n\nI’ve found PathPlanner’s telemetry tab to be useful, but a little limiting. When we were tuning our paths, we logged a bunch of data (encoder readouts, set voltages, etc.) and then looked at it afterwards in AdvantageScope.\n\nYou can turn on logging like so:\n\nIf you do so, you’ll want to periodically delete your logs and/or use an external USB drive for logging.\n\nIn this case, the first thing I’d recommend you do is compare currentPose and targetPose, which should be logged automatically by pathplanner. If you’re currentPose matches you’re robots position on the field, and is different than target pose, I’d think that you’d have to tune you’re drive wheels PID /feedforward, or the holonomic controller’s constants (more likely the former). If the currentPose is the same as the target pose, it might be a little bit harder to fix, and it may be caused by wheel slip, or the fact that you’re estimating the robots movement by a series of straight lines (though it seems a little dramatic for that).",
