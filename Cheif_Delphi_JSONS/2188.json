I’ve seen everything from 6328’s mind boggling approach by basically automating all matchplay, to navigating to any branch position, to not auto align at all. And this is only what I’ve seen.\n\nSo I was wondering - does your team have a somewhat different approach than what you’ve seen normally to auto align? For example, my team had the driver controller vibrate whenever the driver was okay to place to coral, which was our approach to auto align.",

We’d rumble the controller when this sequence ended to signal to the driver that he could start the next cycle.\n\nWe accomplished most of the automation that occurred on  top of the PIDs using Trigger composition, which is all done in our RobotContainer file here if you want an example. Our process was essentially:\n\nDriveToPose command targeting the reef that is triggered by the left & right-align buttons\n\nCommands to set mechanism PIDs that are controlled by Triggers checking for if the reef is being targeted & how close we are to it\n\nA command to score the coral, triggered by if the reef is being targeted & all necessary mechanisms are in position",

It doesn’t use the SwerveDrivePoseEstimator odometry at all. This works really well by itself but we marginally improved the convergence behavior with this .\n\nThe desired pose is calculate with trigonometry from the reef angle. We have two cameras exactly 6.5 inches from the center (distance between reef branch and apriltag) so there’s always a Limelight that sees the tag.\n\nThen there’s some other stuff for automatically raising the elevator and ejecting the coral by checking distance/error to the desired position.",
