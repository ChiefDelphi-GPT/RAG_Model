I thought learning GD&T would help, yet it appears quite complex and challenging to grasp. Additionally, our team doesn’t have access to CNC machining capabilities that rely on detailed technical drawings.  \n\nDo other teams utilize GD&T? Should I begin using GD&T? If yes, what is the most effective way to learn it?",

I wouldn’t suggest you use GD&T because it’s too time-consuming for both you and the manufacturing students. You could include some common symbols in your drawings if time permits, but don’t expect much progress. The students struggle with keeping things within simple tolerances, making additional constraints difficult.\n\nInstead, focus on becoming very proficient at dimensioning your drawings. Make sure dimensions are complete, clear, and minimize the need for complex calculations. Use appropriate tolerances, notes, and avoid ambiguity.\n\nI used to be skilled in GD&T but haven’t used it actively in 25 years, so I’ve forgotten a lot. However, as an internal machinist, I found it more useful to communicate important details on drawings to engineers or designers. This allowed me to effectively meet their needs.\n\nAdditionally, I want to ensure you can inspect parts using GD&T to confirm they meet specifications. Without this, how can I verify the value of what I’m paying for? Tight tolerances or over/tight ones add costs through extra time, effort, or materials.\n\nGD&T is valuable for engineers and designers, but it’s not necessary during your FIRST Robotics Competition experience. Take your time learning it now, as you probably won’t need it later.\n\nCoincidentally, I came across a link to an introduction on GD&T, but I’m not endorsing it. There are plenty of other resources available.\n\nFor those ready, GD&T basics include True Position, concentricity, parallelism, perpendicularity, circularity, straightness, flatness, and angularity. Master these fundamentals before diving deeper into GD&T. Always prioritize learning how to create clear and effective drawings first.",

This is partly due to limited meeting time, which forces the user to frequently monitor the machinist's work, often while they're occupied with other tasks. A mentor provides valuable feedback by questioning the user's drawings, though this doesn't bother the user much since the mentor is correct and the user's drawings are deemed \"not good enough.\" Additionally, the lack of time prevents the user from having students teach them how to create effective drawings. The user's question is about transitioning from a beginner level to effectively communicating design intent through drawings without extensive face-to-face explanations. The user uses OnShape.",

Let me clarify that.  \nI've marked up and sent back drawings on my team for missing dimensions.  \n\nWhen communicating the intent of something depicted in a drawing, it's essential to ensure clear communication. However, effective communication becomes simpler when both parties share common understanding. This isn't a CAD-related issue.  \n\nIn my opinion, the first step is to learn how to machine using the appropriate tools. Creating parts from drawings, including ones you've created, while marking them up with missing dimensions or notes will enhance your understanding. Once you grasp what's missing in the drawings you're sending for machining, incorporating those details will streamline the process.",

Another important point is that your school-based machinists may be just as inexperienced as you.

These drawings often come from recognizable, high-profile industries such as medical, technology, defense, aerospace, and even smaller startups or family-owned businesses. Don’t take it personally.

Ask the machinist additional questions about what information they need beyond what I’ve already provided. Treat these requests as constructive feedback.  \n2. Recognize that completing a part efficiently the first time is valuable and not time-wasting.  \n3. Engage in a conversation with the machinist to explain the complexities of my drawing.  \n\nFor example, “Please ensure the hole in this block aligns with the other hole so the shaft can slide smoothly between them” (get the shaft if possible).  \nNote: The machinist may not need to know the holes are for lateral intake on the bot.",

It helps communicate design intent to the machine shop and ensures parts/tolerance stackups fit as intended. Interns at J&J (or in general in the industry) are not expected to have learned GD&T, and nearly all haven’t fully mastered it. It’s something taught on the job with guidance and peer review.",

Additionally, concentricity was removed from the Y14.5 standard in 2018. When I took GD&T training years ago, true position was replaced with just position. As for basic GD&T symbols, I’d start with the ones related to position and straightness, then move on to parallelism and perpendicularity.",
