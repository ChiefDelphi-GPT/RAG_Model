For reference, here is our code repository . We’ve never used PathPlanner before, and we’d like to use it for auto this year.\n\nOur software versions are as follows: WPILib: 2024.1.1 PathPlanner: v2024.1.2 PathPlannerLib: v2024.1.3 All other software and firmware has been updated to their latest versions.\n\nAfter reading the PathPlanner Getting Started page , we put the AutoBuilder configuration in our SwerveSubsystem file:\n\nThen in RobotContainer , we put this for the auto:\n\nAs far as PathPlanner goes, this is what we’ve got: image 1266×713 23.2 KB\n\nimage 1266×713 23.2 KB\n\nimage 1266×713 23.2 KB\n\nWe just have Auto1 which has nothing but Path1 , no events or anything.\n\nThe resulting action when running this is the robot accelerating quickly to it’s forward-right direction. The floor on which it ran was very smooth and due to it’s rapid acceleration, it skidded a ton which I’m sure is not helping. My main concern is why is it going in that direction every time? I’ve also tried rotating the robot to check if it’s a weird gyro issue but it is always relative to the robot. I’d love to learn the in’s and out’s of PathPlanner and how teams have overcome these issues before.",

There are many great OA threads with plenty of public code to look over. Here are a few:\n\n8088 - Bionic Panthers (shameless self-promotion)\n\n4481 - Rembrandts\n\nForgot what TEAM this was (sorry)\n\nI think this is 8598 - ElectroKnights\n\nGoing over different codes like the above will definitely bolster your knowledge of how pathplanner is implemented with different teams.\n\nThis may be similar to what you are experiencing. There could be many reasons why your bot is drifting, but make sure to test them sequentially, and to triple check all 4 modules are the same. (In both your hardware client and code)\n\nHope this helps\n\nEdit: Make sure you have all your constraints/data/settings in pathplanner properly configured image 800×422 16.5 KB\n\nimage 800×422 16.5 KB\n\nimage 800×422 16.5 KB",

There are many great OA threads with plenty of public code to look over.\n\nThank you. I notice on the 8088 - Bionic Panthers code that there are some paths in the deploy directory but I didn’t see PathPlanner used in the code, rather I saw trajectories manually in the sDrive command file. It is better to start by making trajectories manually before going into PathPlanner? I assumed that PathPlanner is better due to it’s apparent user-friendliness, especially in the 2024 updates.\n\nXactlysharp:\n\nThis may be similar to what you are experiencing. There could be many reasons why your bot is drifting, but make sure to test them sequentially, and to triple check all 4 modules are the same. (In both your hardware client and code)\n\nThat could be the issue, I think however it might be due to our wheels. They are suffering damage after driving them through one competition and down several blocks of a road for a parade. I just included that issue in this thread incase it is somehow connected to the PathPlanner issue.",
