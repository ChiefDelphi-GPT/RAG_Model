We’ve historically used 80/20 along with the KOP Chassis.  I want to try and migrate over to using VersaFrame system (on top of the KOP Chassis) this year to test it out the “can be built with basic tools” theory since our team lacks many advanced manufacturing capabilities and building experience (mentors and students).  I plan to go ahead and pre-order some stock so that we have some on-hand once we enter our prototyping and building in a couple of weeks.  I wanted to see if anyone had any general or specific recommendations on which stock sizes you’ve found more beneficial to have on hand?  Or any great resources  to help us learn how to dream up the cool configurations we see on other robots?  I saw this website in a thread today and plan to explore it for inspiration.  Also if you’ve made the same switchover at some point if you have any lessons learned, that would be great to hear too.\n\nThanks in advance!",

This will require drilling the holes to be slightly larger, but that can easily be done with a cordless drill\n\n*Buy more gussets than you think you’ll need. You’ll burn thru t-shaped and/or plus-shaped gussets quickly.\n\n*Dont be afraid to drill new holes on the “solid” faces when you need to. Especially useful when making angled cuts.\n\n*Get comfortable with a workflow that lets you cut the segments to length quickly and accurately. We use a miter saw, but a bandsaw can work just as well. Hack saws or reciprocating saws can get the job done in a pinch, but shouldn’t be your go-to.\n\n*Get comfortable match-drilling, and your options for mounting components and gussets will expand.",

We are going to take on our first build using tube and versaframe.  Good Lord our last competition machine was entirely CAD designed, laser cut and welded together from about 40 pieces.\n\nbot 461×508 129 KB\n\nbot 461×508 129 KB\n\nbot 461×508 129 KB\n\nYou’ll need to be able to mark, drill and cut accurately and get good quickly with rivets.  Having to work mostly with a miter saw we have had competitions to see who can cut closest to specs.  One of our kids has a talent for quality control and gets the micrometer out to judge.  We’ve also practices with rivets 3/16 and 1/4 as well as rivnuts which look useful for attaching upper works to drive base.  We’ve used little 80/20 “feet” in the past with success.\n\nIf you are long on 80/20 parts you likely have some sturdy 1/4 based brackets around.  These are pretty handy for tube rivet frame.\n\nIn general 1 by 2 and 1 by 1 are the most useful.  We have a mix of versaframe and generic tube, but we do have some decent drill jigs the kids have made.  1/16th thickness should suffice although there might be call for the occasional 1/8 in a real load bearing situation?\n\nOthers here know much more but thought I chime in as we are in a similar situation.

We have tended to build with a plate and standoff style, but are thinking that maybe this could add some more possibilities.\n\nWith teams that use it, what are their thoughts on 3D printed drilling jigs. Given the hole pattern, it seems like you could get pretty good alignment with a 3D printed jig that bolts to the holes for alignment and uses some drill bushings . Ive also imagined some 3D printed miter saw jigs to ensure that your cuts are where you want them.\n\nThoughts?\n\nImagining things like this",

Second, do you really need to use tubes with pre-drilled holes?  You can even use a gusset to make sure you holes are centered and spaced correctly.  The pre drilled holes can come in handy at times, but they also come with a bit of a price premium.\n\nVex: 2 90 degree versa gussets - $5.99, so 5.99 * 4 = $24 The Thrifty Bot: 8 90 degree thrifty gussets - $19.99\n\nVex: 1 1\"x1\"x59\" (.4 wall) versa tube - $25 From online metals: 1 1\"x1\"x60\" (.625) - $13.82\n\nShipping TBD of course.

My preference is not to bore them out unless the strength seems inadequate.

We’ve lost our build space in a machine shop and are now going back to a “shop” at the school which is primarily just an insulated and heated detached garage.  I’ve picked up a small bandsaw for us to use and we have a MitreSaw with a metal cutting blade installed.  I’m planning on also picking up a benchtop drill press for the shop but haven’t pulled the trigger yet.  Any recommendations on a decent one or any other “gotta-have-it” tools when working with VersaFrame?  We also have a couple of cordless drills.",

We’ve found that 5/32 Al mandrel rivets were prone to eventually coming loose/failing over the course of an FRC season (particularly in high shock load games like 2016). After we switched to 3/16, this became far less of an issue.",

To do that I suggest a couple of good spring load center punches (get two of all small important tools if affordable!) , some marker fluid, a really narrow marking stylus (blade of a box cutter seems to work), and of course measuring devices of your choice.  We have a pretty green crew this season and have been playing around with stuff.  Big fan of Thriftybot and second the nom on their brackets and such.  We have some off site laser access so can make our own as well.  We’ve been prototyping with their clamp on bearing blocks.  Likely others make them as well.  You’ll need something to put a hole through tube big enough for a hex shaft.  Various options exist but a small metal cutting hole saw works for the patient.  We had a pneumatic riveter but it gave us a bit of trouble.  It’s now on the “get around to it” shelf where it will likely stay a while.  I mentioned 1/4 rivets a while back.  Really overkill but I suspected you had 80/20 brackets from your prior builds.  Sometimes a bit of overkill is ok.",

Doing it by hand for the time being means Old School.  Careful measure.  Dab of blue marker paint.  Scribe carefully and in the case of drilling give it a good punch and use the laser cross hairs on the drill press to put the pilot hole spot on.  Know how wide your saw blade is and adjust your measurements accordingly.  “Kerf”, your word for the day.\n\nSeems primitive but basic metalworking is not something most kids get exposed to.\n\nIn parallel we are of course also ramping up our CAD efforts, doing more outreach to laser cutting firms in the community (frustrating issues with .dxl files from Fusion right now).\n\nIn retirement I’ve actually gone back to Tech School and learned this stuff.  Making a nice precise part by hand is very satisfying.  But you have to also advance as your circumstances allow into CNC, lasers, high end 3D printing.\n\nBest o’ Luck.  I’m not really a builder either.  Retired ER doc.",
