However, you’re gonna need to gear it down with a gearbox.\n\nAs I was typing this, multiple people already responded with calculators you can use to find what gearing you need.\n\nWhile it’s easy to design custom gearboxes for certain applications, depending on the space, it may just be easier to use a premade COTS planetary gearbox. Both VEX and Rev Robotics make very easy to use and modular gearbox platforms as part of their VexPRO and ION series respectively. They have their own limits however, so use a gearbox calculator to figure out what you need. You won’t get as exact with the planetary gearboxes however, because of their modular nature, but you can stack various reductions to get close.",

It’s like a mechanical diode as the spur gear can’t apply the rotational torque to the worm gear to move it from that side but the motor driving the worm gear moves things very well.  That means the arm can’t back drive the motor which means the position is retained when power is removed.\n\nDue to the mechanical relationship, you can get a non-trivial amount of gear reduction just from the worm gear setup but you’ ll probably need a gearbox anyway.\n\nIt doesn’t have to be the final part of your gear train and could be used as the first stage or even an intermediate stage if that suits things better.  It also provides a 90 degree turn as part of it’s natural design which might be a packaging win (or a packaging loss depending on what you’re doing).\n\nJust tossing that out.  Just off the top of my head, I don’t seem to recall a lot of worm drive setups in FRC that I’ve personally seen but I might have just glossed over them here and there.  Andymark has a set with a 10:1 reduction and of course McMaster-Carr has a fair selection as well.",

Bonus points as it usually allows for low mounting of the motor.\n\nNow the above may be less of a concern, just pay close attention to the specifics of the gearbox and practical considerations (such as motor mounts) when developing the layout of the gear train.\n\nRemember, there is a LOT to be gained (mechanical and software) by making the arm “weightless” with some counterbalancing (see gas springs mounted on sprockets/levers). Then all you are fighting is rotational inertia.",

Most worm drives are actually backdriveable they are just very high friction when back driven. The high friction is still going to be helpful for keeping an arm in place. I like to say that worm gears shouldn’t be back driven, not that they can’t be. Secondly building a custom worm gearbox requires pretty precise machining in 2 directions to function well, which can be surprisingly difficult depending on machining capabilities. The same is true of miter gears, so I machine the box then trial and error shims until the gears run smoothly.",
