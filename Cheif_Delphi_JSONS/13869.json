Very very very easy to understand/learn (our school board runs off Google, so students are familiar with those tools).\n\nFor someone that knows that Google Drive isn’t ideal for CAD files, workbench allowed for easy/seamless version control of CAD files, along with an easy method to “lock” files when being worked on. If you chose not to lock your files, and someone revised the part/assembly you’d been working on, you’d be warned that the file had been updated since you last “sync’d” your files.\n\nAll of this was achieved (from the end user’s perspective) by creating a simple account, downloading a single program, and directing that program to a specific folder location to start syncing/saving your files. Frankly, I’d say it was just about idiot proof, with about as small a learning curve as you could possibly get.",

The Local Folder and Workbench function as upload and download folders, both highly apparent that you have something outstanding to up or download. Not eating your bandwidth with a constant up or download. This also allows for fewer but very regimented and easy to track updates.\n\nThe updates page, the webpage that you are taken to to see which files have changed with each upload, is great for troubleshooting problems. Working with people (students and adults), with differing abilities and understanding of Grabcad, someone will inevitably move a part or change a name not realizing it may blow up the entire mating of an assembly. Additionally the notes feature (although rarely used by our students). The online viewer (although often slow) is great for troubleshooting this as well.\n\nThe local folder method of storage is intuitive and something we all already know, great for quickly jumping in as we are learning. I learned how to do Solidworks and GrabCad while i had covid.

I also agree with his other points.\n\nOur process: Create a new project for the new robot or other new thing we are designing. People create new parts/assemblies and sync those from local to the GrabCad repository and pull in part/assemblies created by others.\n\nNote: We also have some “reference” projects that contain common shared items like motors, gearboxes, bearings, etc., essentially parts that will be used in multiple projects.  Each person starting on the CAD team pulls in the latest project they will be working in, plus the reference projects.\n\nWe also use GrabCad to store any type of SolidWorks files (drawings, pdf output files), and also our CNC gcode files.",

The appeal of this is that it’s easy to setup, easy to learn, and relatively intuitive.\n\nTheoretically sharing your CAD with other teams was pretty easy too although I never really figured out an easy way to move stuff to partner spaces quickly.\n\nHaving a Common Parts Library that everyone automatically had access to was pretty helpful.\n\nAbility to check out parts was helpful, albeit you had to go to the browser to do this so we rarely actually used it. Instead we just used Slack to say “I’m in intake assembly”.\n\nBeing able to revert versions was good, but it only saved 30 days worth of versions.\n\nAbility to automatically open local folder or open on GrabCAD site was convenient.\n\nGC didn’t care about file type so we could store excel files with design calculations right in the same folders with the sub assembly",

With the announcement that workbench will be gone as of June 2023, it’s brought to light just how much we take the software for granted. Investigating alternatives has already been headache inducing for me.\n\nWhile it wouldn’t be a guarantee we’d still use it, if GrabCAD turned around today and announced they were starting to charge $50/year (totally random example cost) per workspace (not per project or user) to cover the cost of keeping their servers going, I’d be strongly urging my team to consider that cost.\n\nObviously if I was choosing between essentially equivalent software, but one was free, I’d take the free one.

I would grant edit access to this new folder to the students and mentors that needed it and view only access to those who didn’t. We had issues in the past with someone with mild OCD moving files around that didn’t need to be in that folder causing headaches, so per-project write access is a must.\n\nI also have the common parts library open to all who need it with the local folder set to ‘read only’ to prompt users to not edit the vendor components in that folder. I kind of wish this folder had a little more control like my last experience with Solidworks PDM, everything is locked but new parts can be pushed to the directory as needed (and locked automatically).\n\nThe other open folder is the Research and Development folder for those that want to tinker in the offseason or develop a project for the fall. It is more or less trust-based and anyone can dump files there.\n\nAfter any given year I will typically remove write access to most users to effectively lock out that project and archive it. This also lessens the number of files any new user needs to download from the cloud to work on any single project (competition year). For the first few years with the Workbench, we used a single project folder along with a common parts library and an R&D folder and things started getting messy when a new user would have to download 3-4 years worth of robots just to modify a couple of parts on this year’s robot. Being able to segregate into project folders with simple admin controls was one of my favorite aspects of GrabCAD.\n\nThe one feature it lacked that I liked from my previous employer and our use of PDM was checking in and checking out of work. GrabCAD handled conflicts pretty well and would let you pick and choose which version you wanted to become official but this could have been avoided by effectively locking out access to associated files when someone checks out a subassembly. This feature used to work when GC had a SW plugin, but that was short-lived.\n\nAs someone who used Solidworks PDM for about three years and occasionally had access to to the admin panel, it is far too complex for what we need in FIRST. Far too cumbersome to set up (especially the networked server), a lot of workflow and acceptance tools, scripting for custom functions, etc. All nice features to have for a power user or someone who needs to show the ISO auditor that we keep to our workflow but very much overkill for FIRST robotics.\n\nIf you told me DS Solidworks had a cloud-based, simplified, PDM/Vault system that allowed us to not skip a beat in using the desktop version of SW and had an online viewer that kept up with the version changes I would switch yesterday.\n\nGrabCAD just kind of ‘worked’, for my team and a lot of others.\n\nTl;dr Google Drive with CAD file recognition, a desktop app, and revision history, same Admin/Edit/View access as well. That is more or less what GC was for us.",

Very very very easy to understand/learn (our school board runs off Google, so students are familiar with those tools).\n\nFor someone that knows that Google Drive isn’t ideal for CAD files, workbench allowed for easy/seamless version control of CAD files, along with an easy method to “lock” files when being worked on. If you chose not to lock your files, and someone revised the part/assembly you’d been working on, you’d be warned that the file had been updated since you last “sync’d” your files.\n\nAll of this was achieved (from the end user’s perspective) by creating a simple account, downloading a single program, and directing that program to a specific folder location to start syncing/saving your files. Frankly, I’d say it was just about idiot proof, with about as small a learning curve as you could possibly get.\n\nSeconding all of the above.  Ease of use (for high schoolers who don’t care to learn difficult interfaces) is huge.\n\nAnd to add on to this, the biggest little feature for us was the small integration in SolidWorks that notified you of the Lock State of a file that you opened.  It is an absolute pain teaching people (especially young people) to keep track of who has what file locked, to make sure to lock the file before making changes, and to unlock after you are done.  The integration that gave you little notifications whenever you were editing a locked part (and who had locked it so you know who to bug), or a reminder to lock if you started making changes, were amazing.  We CONSTANTLY had conflicts after GrabCAD removed this integration feature because we regularly had different people making slight changes to overlapping assemblies and parts.  This is why we went to OnShape, because we never had to worry about proper locking again.",

While everyone is saying free, I look to Google Drive, where accounts get 15GB for free by default, and can then have the option of upgrading to 100 GB for $2/month or 200 GB for $3/month, and so on. I think that’s incredibly fair. I would be more than happy to pay a reasonably small amount a year to get upgraded storage if it helps pay for running and upkeep costs of a GrabCAD replacement.\n\nFor reference, the GrabCAD folder for my previous team is about 46 GB, which spans a ~5 year period. If I were to guess, I’d say that’s on the heavier side of most GrabCAD workbench accounts, though I could be wrong. Either way, if Dassault Systemes is considering making their own GrabCAD replacement product, the cost of creating and running such a product is obviously going to be a major discussion point in their decision making. I think it’s only fair (and extremely doable by FIRST teams) to pay a small subscription cost for the service. Maybe even in the future if the system is up and running and somewhat self-sustaining it could be part of the SolidWorks sponsorship deal.\n\ntl;dr: Putting my money where my mouth is because getting a good product that fills this gap is really important to me.\n\nEdit: Should probably throw some feature suggestions in to help with the original post.\n\nTorrance already listed most of them. Some extras that would be nice to have are:\n\nOnline viewer for parts and assemblies that allows markup and comments (I think eDrawings Viewer does this, but integrated into the grabcad replacement would be nice)\n\nA mobile / tablet app that allows usage of the online viewer, markup, comments, etc. (It could just be a website, I really just wanna be able to provide feedback from my phone)\n\nAbility to create groups that I can add accounts to (like Google Groups for email) separate from the partner spaces equivalent would be nice, so that way groups can be given permissions and people can be added or removed from groups (much easier than adding people individually and changing permissions every time)\n\nIf there is a lock / unlock or check-out / check-in feature, please make it optional or allow admins of the project to have full control over the status of files. I look back to the horror days at previous jobs when someone checks out a file and forgets to check back in, leaves work, and now nobody can access the file until they get back.",

I use it to share cad files between multiple computers with my account and to share files/assemblies with friends.\n\nIf there is a cost I wonder if it would be better to have it be a yearly subscription cost instead of monthly. I know a few teams associated with schools have to get a lot of purchases checked if they are not with preapproved vendors and if Dassault ends up not being ones of those approved vendors then having to pay monthly might be a pita.",

I feel like for most teams, adding a single <$100 line item in their annual budgets is a no-brainer, and for those who may not be able to do so as easily, see below.\n\nI believe a free tier is important for hobbiests, students, and low-budget education programs / teams that don’t need a lot of storage (maybe they store previous years’ work on a local drive and only have the current year’s work on the cloud drive). It’s what gets people using the software, and the more people that use it the more they will get their future companies to use it. Also some people just have no money to spend on a service like this. Been there, done that. Having the free option was almost always a deciding factor, so it’s worth it for those people.",
