                    "cooked": "Several years ago I helped introduce the extremely cheap, pretty-reliable Huhao router bits to the FRC CNC router community. Since then we’ve come a long way, and the demand for long-lasting, high feedrate endmills is bigger than ever. Even the tool libraries and templates that I host are a bit more aggressive than I would really want to run on a Huhao. Some users even reported Huhao endmills that performed well under the median, either due to a bad batch or bad QC. So while Huhao bits are still good for students new to using a CNC router, experienced teams want higher quality bits that last longer. I was able to get the name of the supplier (Grewin) who made the old Ozzyboards endmills from them and commissioned a small order of 30 endmills for testing in the summer of 2022.\n\nThese endmills performed very well in my tests on aluminum, producing a good surface finish and supporting feed rates above 2 cubic IPM. A few CA bay area teams have been running these all season without issues. Unfortunately, Grewin only takes orders of $150 minimum, which works out to 20-50 endmills depending on what you buy, and they only take payment over Paypal, which can be a hassle for some teams. It’s also just inconvenient for them to support a bunch of tiny orders. Therefore, I’m happy to announce that Redux will be hosting a group buy to get in a big order all at once. This is not going to be a regular product at this price, the price basically just covers production, handling, shipping, and import taxes, with a couple dollars of margin.\n\nThe endmills we’ll be offering are:\n\n1. ⅛” diameter, 12mm cut length, 50mm overall length, DLC coated carbide. 5-pack for $18. 2. 4mm diameter, 12mm cut length, 50mm overall length, DLC coated carbide. 5-pack for $20. 3. 6mm diameter, 12mm cut length, 50mm overall length, DLC coated carbide. 5-pack for $32\n\nShipping will be at the normal rate, that is, free above $50 and reasonable below that. Find the endmills here on our website.\n\nI’ll fire off a group buy if we sell more than ~100 endmills. Orders will be closed on April 16th . Manufacturing will take ~2 weeks with an additional week for shipping, so expect to receive your endmills around May 7th. If this goes well, I’ll do it again next year. If not, everyone gets a refund and can continue getting excellent endmills from WCP , TTB , or just directly from Grewin.\n\nHere’s a video of a Grewin 6mm cutting a 1/4\" plate without coolant on an Omio. 24k RPM , 100 IPM (0.0042 IPT), 0.25\" DOC, 0.06\" WOC, total of 1.5 cubic IPM. Here’s a link to that part if you want to peek at the CAM.\n\nShare 2D and 3D design files and project files with anyone.\n\nNote that the pictures we have are all of uncoated endmills. DLC (Diamond-Like Carbon) coating is rainbow-colored and adds a bit to the cost of each endmill, but I think it’s worth it for a better surface finish and a longer-lasting edge. Also, the 6mm endmill is 17mm cut length in this photo, but we are getting the 12mm cut length for enhanced rigidity when making those deep cuts.\n\nimage 740×934 40 KB\n\nimage 740×934 40 KB\n\nimage 740×934 40 KB\n\nimage 682×908 34.4 KB\n\nimage 682×908 34.4 KB\n\nimage 682×908 34.4 KB",

I was wondering how those would compare. For me, these end mills look really appealing, but I’m not sure if that’s just because I’m not utilizing what I currently have to the highest degree.\n\nWe have their 1/8”, 4mm, 5mm, and 6mm end mills, but we almost exclusively use the 4mm because we prefer holes tighter than 5mm for our rivets.\n\nThanks, Chase",

I don’t have any parts on hand. All my tests were run on Omio X8-2200L USB, though I have tried them on a Langmuir MR-1.\n\nI haven’t benchmarked against “better” endmills. Once you start using a 6mm you’re going to be machine- and setup-limited on an Omio anyway. I can send you a couple uncoated ones for free if you want to compare them against different brands and take some pics of the results.\n\nI doubt that an Onsrud will get 10 times the life though. I’ve killed many endmills and it’s usually a result of poor setups or machine crashes, not natural tool wear, with the exception being really cheap endmills like Huhaos. I wouldn’t buy a $50 endmill for an FRC router.",
