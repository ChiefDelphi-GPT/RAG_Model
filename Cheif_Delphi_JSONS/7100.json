                    "cooked": "Hello! My team has been trying to use PathPlanner for following paths during auto, but we are having a problem with power cycling the robot. When code is deployed to the robot, and autos are run immediately after, the robot follows the path directly. However, upon power cycling the robot, the path that our robot takes is completely messed up.\n\nWhat we found by logging and printing values is that when we deployed code and ran the autos right afterwards, our odometry pose and gyro heading was being set to the correct alliance’s pose and gyro heading. But when the robot was power cycled, our robot would always set the odometry pose and gyro heading to the blue side, and the path would veer towards the red side in a straight line to get to what the robot presumed to be the correct position.\n\nWe think that there is an issue with our logic for choosing the red or blue alliance to set the robot position and heading on the first path of our autos, but it’s just strange how the code works differently just after a power cycle.\n\nI will point out that we are not using the AutoBuilder to reset our robot pose at the start of auto, and we are just using the libraries for following a singular path, setting the pose and heading right before the first follow path command of our auto is run. If AutoBuilder will fix this issue, we are willing to pivot to using it, but I would like to understand why resetting robot pose and heading manually is not working after the power cycle.\n\nHere is our code for following PathPlanner paths, implemented into our Drivetrain subsystem class:\n\nWhen we start autos, we call getPathCommand() with the DISCARDHEADING InitialPathState value, so that it sets the robot pose and heading based off of the pose and heading of the initial path’s start position.\n\nHere is the method for determining whether the path should be inverted or not:\n\nI’m at a loss right now trying to figure out this problem before our competition this weekend, so any help and suggestions would be greatly appreciated!",

You don’t show the code, but I’m assuming you’re trying to do all of this (e.g. calling getPathCommand) from robotInit.  The alliance value is not guaranteed to be valid during robotInit, as the DS may not yet have connected.\n\nEDIT: Checking in disabled won’t work, see replies.\n\nA relatively easy workaround is to wait to set up the path until disabled, using code like the below to do a one-shot setup after getAlliance is valid:",

I think I understand what you said because whenever the robot initializes after power cycling, it isn’t connected to the Driver station and would cause it to not have a value for the alliance color.\n\nThe thing that confuses me is that we aren’t calling getPathCommand in the robotInit() method, we are calling it in a command, which is used in our autonomous routines:\n\nThis Command is called in our auto routines. The only thing I think may be a problem is that we are adding all of the auto Commands to a SendableChooser class during robotInit(), which is used to choose our autos through ShuffleBoard:\n\nWe create an instance of RobotContainer in autonomousInit(), and call configureAutonomousRoutines() in the RobotContainer constructor.\n\nDo you think it would help if we configured the SendableChooser after the Driver station Alliance is present?",

We have seen at the start of a match setup the Alliance being null , then the wrong value, then null or the right value.\n\nThinking about it, that makes sense.  When you plug your computer into the field, the DS can start communicating with the robot (thereby giving the wrong value) prior to the FMS connecting to the DS (giving the right value).  The robot code has no way of knowing whether it’s on the field or not.  Seems like some docs updates are in order.",

Sometimes the Alliance isn’t present (null) and that is correctly reported with Optional (but that isn’t helpful). Sometimes the Alliance is wrong (and that is painful) and Optional cannot help with that case.\n\nI cannot diagnose a race condition but do understand from our WPIlogs the apparent order of initially no alliance, then the alliance from the driver station (wrong half the time), then the alliance from the FMS . The amount of time spent in each of these states does vary.\n\nIt all works out by the time autoInit() starts.\n\nWe had considered setting the match Alliance in our DS before connecting but that just adds to the administrative nightmare of the drive team following a pre-match checklist.",
