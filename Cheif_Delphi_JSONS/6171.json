I was able to find a few good resources for the math behind it, but I’m struggling to figure out how I might make sure both camera’s are detecting the same game piece. My understanding is that if there were two game pieces in the the frame of both cameras, I’d have to make sure both cameras are working with the same game piece, otherwise the two  two rays wont intersect, or will intersect but cause an incorrect calculation. I’m unsure how to solve this issue. My first idea is to do some preliminary estimation using trig and the note size to calculate the pose of each note, and then use said poses to make sure each camera is focused on the same gamepiece when doing stereo based estimation. I think this would work but I don’t like it as it seems unproductive to use one form of estimating where the notes are just to do it again, albeit hopefully more accurarely. If anyone has any ideas or suggestions I’d appreciate any advice. Thanks!",

We did object detection on our robot this year , but with only one camera and were able to spit out multiple note poses. The best strategy I can seem to come up with is having each camera spit out it’s own field poses for each of the notes it sees, and having some threshold where if each camera has a pose that is within some distance of the other, combine it to be once piece. This does risk duplications or combining two actual notes into one though.",

If the number of targets is different in the two images then likely skip those frames.\n\nLacking documented purposeful ordering I would not assume the lists of objects in the two images correspond to each other in order.\n\nIf you want to write your own code as I did then I’d try OpenCV feature matching . The code is brief and simple in Java, C++, or Python.\n\nIn OpenCV you could find the centroid of exterior contours and sort the x, y coordinates and hope they match up. You could check to make sure the points that you think match are all about the same distance apart.\n\nThere likely are other ways but I don’t know them.",

Especially considering some of the niche considerations that need to be made for stereo vision like frame trigger syncing. Its also important to note that while you can estimate the 3d positions of some game pieces with only a 2d camera, it will only reliably work for game pieces which look the same from all viewing angles and orientations.\n\nThis offseasion we built a system that uses a ZED 2 deph camera and Jetson Orin coprocessor with a custom CUDA accelerated backend that enables us to track objects in 3d space (through the steroscopoc depth estimation) with YOLOv10 (or v8) object detection. Additionally, we are able to persistently track objects between frames. We are planning to demo this technology at Madtown Throwdown on our main bot.\n\nScreenshot_2024-07-09_184759 1674×1048 145 KB\n\nScreenshot_2024-07-09_184759 1674×1048 145 KB\n\nScreenshot_2024-07-09_184759 1674×1048 145 KB\n\nOur  code for this (on the coproc side) can be found here.",
