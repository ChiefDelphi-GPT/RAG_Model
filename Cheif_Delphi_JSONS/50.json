                    "cooked": "Very clean routing. I particularly like the close placement of the breaker to the PDH and battery. Also, the SparkMax on NEO mounts (is the CAD for those public?).\n\nThe wiring is definitely pretty good for an offseason robot/test robot, but here are some recommendations I would make for an in-season robot that it might be a good idea to practice and teach people on the full robot.\n\nRunning wires under the frame close to the ground like that seems risky to me. They can snag on things, some games might have terrain, and it seems bad for transport. Maybe it would be better if there was some sort of removable protection beneath, or you can try the brainpan approach that some teams do, if you have a suitable robot cart.\n\nYou're using some inline and some non-inline wagos. Either is fine, but it feels like you used the normal wagos in some places where inline would be cleaner. I would be more standardized and purposeful about what you choose where, rather than just using whatever you have on hand. When I looked at the robot of 841 in 2024 (a local team that I think has good reliability practices), they used a lot of inline wagos.\n\nI would find a way to attach your wago connectors to the frame so they are not floating. This can be hard but Wago sells some mounts (some with built-in strain relief, you can buy from Digikey) or you can look for 3D printed mounts on CD.\n\nI would strain relieve your connections better. The way we typically do this is by zip tying each side of every connection to the frame or an adhesive zip tie mount (with some slack).\n\nOne of the most common reliability issues I've experienced is with the NEO encoder cable connector. I notice you ziptied the encoder cables into bundles. This is nice, but it doesn't look like that bundle is particularly well constrained, so as it shifts around it will put stress on the connection. I would ziptie the encoder cable something attached to the frame before it enters the bundle (maybe an adhesive ziptie mount on top or beside the spark max?). I would also make sure you hotglue the encoder connection before the robot sees the field (a hotglue gun powered by a drill battery can help here).\n\nI notice one pair of wires (by your hands) has an extra pair of wago connectors and what looks like a non-wago splice. Why is that? If it's because you cut the wire too short, you should cut a new wire. I would highly recommend stocking up on high-quality flexible wire and using exclusively that on your robot (I like bonded silicone). I also think it's a very bad idea to have your wagos below the frame.\n\nWhich ports you chose on the PDH seem kind of haphazard. I would make sure there's a system.\n\nUse this RIO power connector instead of the default screw terminal: [AndyMark, Inc](https://www.andymark.com/products/roborio-power-phoenix-push-in-spring-connector) (also available from Digikey, lmk if you need the PN). Also, very small thing, but I would turn the RIO 180 degrees so the power connector is closer to ports on the PDH, just for cleanness.\n\nI would backup your navx power over USB so that it doesn't reboot if you brownout (mxp power drops out at 6.3V).\n\nI know this is a lot but reliable wiring is all about attention to detail. It's also an area where there are good returns to doing things well upfront.\n\nHere is a recent post of mine where I make product recommendations:\n\n[Link to Post](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/wire-management/498210/32)\n\n[Link to Another Post](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/most-common-issues-seen-on-robots-this-year/466119)\n\nEdit: I missed you are in Turkey so parts might be harder/longer to source. Definitely important to stock up on all supplies you need before the season then (and the good thing is that electrical supplies don’t go bad). There's also alternate vendors for a lot of the products I mentioned.",

There is still space on the top of the belly pan where wires could be placed. Additionally, the placement of Spark Max on the motors leaves the input/output wires exposed to being hit by another robot’s intake or arm. It would be better to position those wires on the belly pan as well.",

Since we don't have inline wagons and finding them in our city is difficult, we're using non-inline wagos. We plan to replace these wagos with solder during the season.  \n\nWe tried to position the input close to the Spark Max on the PDH, but if it remains under the bellypan, we’re considering running the wiring over the bellypan to address the issues you mentioned.  \n\nUnfortunately, due to supply challenges in Turkey, we may need alternatives for some materials you mentioned. Thank you for your suggestions; we’ll take them into account.",
