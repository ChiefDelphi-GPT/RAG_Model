                    "cooked": "Very clean routing. I particularly like the close placement of the breaker near the PDH (Rev's Power Distribution Hub) and battery. Also, the SparkMax on NEO could benefit from having the CAD details made public.\n\nThe wiring is decent for an offseason robot, but there are some areas for improvement when building a full-season robot. For instance, running wires close to the ground near the frame is risky due to potential snagging, especially on rough terrain. Adding removable protection or using a brainpan approach could enhance safety.\n\nMixing inline and non-inline wagons is acceptable, but inline wagons often provide neater designs. A more consistent wiring strategy across the robot could improve reliability and maintenance.\n\nTo prevent floating wago connectors, attaching them securely to the frame would be beneficial. Wago offers mounts, either with strain relief or 3D-printed options, which are worth considering.\n\nStrain relieving connections properly is crucial. Using zip ties or adhesive mounts ensures secure and durable connections. Additionally, tying cables to the frame before bundling them can reduce stress points during operation.\n\nNEO encoder cable connectors can experience shifting bundles, causing stress. Zipping these cables tightly to the frame, possibly using an adhesive mount, would mitigate this issue. Hotgluing encoder connections before the robot deploys on the field can also help maintain stability.\n\nExcess wires with extra connectors and splices may indicate inefficient wiring. High-quality flexible wire, such as bonded silicone, should be prioritized to avoid issues. Placing these components below the frame is discouraged.\n\nWiring layout consistency on the PDH is essential for easier troubleshooting. Clear port assignments can streamline operations and reduce confusion.\n\nUsing a RIO Power Phoenix Push-in Spring Connector is recommended over default screw terminals. Rotating the connector 180 degrees can align it better with nearby ports for cleaner design. Backup navx power via USB prevents potential failures caused by brownouts.\n\nThese tips highlight the importance of meticulous wiring for a reliable robot. Attention to detail pays off in the long run, ensuring smoother competition performance.",

They shouldn’t run the wires on the underside because they’re very exposed. Also, placing the Spark Max units on the motors leaves the input/output wires fairly exposed to potential damage from another robot’s intake or arm. I’d suggest putting them on the belly pan too.",

Since we don’t have inline wagons and they are not easy to find in our city, we had to use non-inline wagons and are planning to replace these wagons with solder during the season. We tried to use the input close to the Spark Max as much as we can on the PDH, but if it stays under the belly pen, we are thinking of doing the wiring over the belly pen from the beginning to solve the problems you mentioned. Since we live in Turkey, unfortunately, we have problems in the supply of some materials, so we will look for alternatives to the materials you mentioned. Thank you for your suggestions; we will consider them.",
