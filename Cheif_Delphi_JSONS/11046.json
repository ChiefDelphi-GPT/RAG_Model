                    "cooked": "After the Lake Superior Regional, I (programming mentor for 1714) began looking into logging. I was aware of AdvantageKit but I didn’t wanna redo our class structure in the middle of the season. So I opted for WPILib’s recommended solution which is based on the DataLogManager class. I added began adding logging to different subsystems through their periodic methods. I did so slowly and over time. After the Wisconsin regional, we had been running logging for a while to no ill effect so I figured that it was safe to add a bunch more. The result was all of our mechanisms moved a lot slower than they should. We reverted the code to a version that was before I made those changes. This seemed to work but I sat down to identify why this was such an issue.\n\nAnother programming mentor figured that the logging was not thread safe and was running into file write-blocking issues, slowing down the control loops of the main mechanisms. This theory fits with what we were experiencing but didn’t make sense as the docs of the DataLopManager claim that “the data log facilities provided by WPILib have minimal overhead to robot code, as all file I/O is performed on a separate thread–the log operation consists of mainly a mutex acquisition and copying the data”\n\nTo test this theory I decided to strip the logging from everything and just log the amount of time between loops of our Swerve subsystem. Then I proceeded to do tests by adding some logging back in and seeing the results. Below are images from AdvantageScope.\n\nNo Logging: image 1920×1026 90.6 KB\n\nimage 1920×1026 90.6 KB\n\nimage 1920×1026 90.6 KB\n\nSome Logging: image 1920×1024 102 KB\n\nimage 1920×1024 102 KB\n\nimage 1920×1024 102 KB\n\nAll Logging: image 1920×1030 94.1 KB\n\nimage 1920×1030 94.1 KB\n\nimage 1920×1030 94.1 KB\n\nThe logging for loop time was done in this file .\n\nBranch with no logging .\n\nBranch with some logging.\n\nBranch with all logging .\n\nThe current setup we have for logging is as follows in each subsystem (taken from Arm.java ):\n\nDeclare objects in subsystem class:\n\nInstantiate objects in subsystem constructor:\n\nLog data in a method called in periodic() :\n\n}\n\nI understand that this is a lot of data to log but only logging 20 different data points (the some logging branch) caused the RoboRIO’s loop time to spike to 60ms, 3x what it is normally at. Now there are some workarounds like spacing out the logging and scheduling different subsystems at different times but this still feels off to me.\n\nIf this is a widely used logging method, why are we experiencing this? Am I just expecting too much out of this?",

It also does not block on file writes.  It’s about as fast as we can possibly make it on the Rio.  I suspect what’s going on is getting the value to be written is taking a lot longer than you might expect.  Have you separately benchmarked just the reads (e.g. getMotorTemperature etc) from the writes to the log?\n\nThe code path for writing a double is:\n\nDataLog.appendDouble()\n\nDataLogJNI.appendDouble()\n\nJNI code for appendDouble\n\nC++ DataLog::AppendDouble\n\nThe C++ DataLog::AppendDouble() grabs a single mutex, does some buffer arithmetic (and allocates a buffer if necessary, the block size is 16 KB, so this should occur relatively infrequently), and copies the 8 bytes.  This mutex is not held when writing the buffers to the file, which occurs on a background thread (by default the buffers are written every 0.25 seconds, but this period can be adjusted, as it’s a time/space tradeoff).\n\nStrings do have a bit more overhead–in addition to copying the data into the log, there’s also an extra copy/conversion step to go from Java’s UTF-16 strings to UTF-8.\n\nFor absolute maximum performance you can grab the timestamp once and pass it to all of the append() calls.  This avoids incurring the [relatively small, ~1 us] cost of getting the timestamp on each call.",

(If this is what you intended to collect, forgive me- I may have misinterpreted what you meant)\n\nThat third graph is a little concerning- I suspect Peter may be into something with where the data is coming from, though.\n\nYou could try running a profiler like VisualVM to help track down what function calls are taking the longest",

That is to say, the data is transmitted automatically by the motor controller so all the RIO has to do is to copy it from a local buffer to the log. I don’t think something like ramp rate is one of those signals. For signals that aren’t in a periodic status frame, the robot code does a blocking read, which could take time (and also increase busload). There’s a reference page here for the Spark Max about it.",
