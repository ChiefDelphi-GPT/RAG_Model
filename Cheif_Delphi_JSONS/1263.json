Due to the current position of the limelight it cannot see the reef april tags when we are aligned, so we believe that we might need to get another limelight.\n\nBecause we haven’t worked with multiple limelights yet we have some questions and worries and we would like your help, we are currently working with limelighthelpers -\n\nhow do we set up two limelights? from what i have read in other posts - we need to change some parts not according to the documentation.\n\nIs there anything we should know about working with 2 limelights before we commit to it?\n\nHow do 2 limelight network tables work behind the scenes (we are asking this to know if there is we should look out for)?\n\nThe second thing is that the limelights will be positions in “weird” places, they will be off to the side of the robot and slanted down (and maybe slanted towards the middle), we are aware that you can set up in the website the limelight’s relative position so it will work with these positions in theory, but will it work only in theory or also in reality? and if not, what problems we might encounter?\n\nI know i’m asking alot of questions but any clarification would help, thanks alot.",

You can quickly align by looking at your position in the field. If you are not aligning according to odometry, you can approach after measuring from a close distance that limelight will see. The first method is much more reliable.\n\nRight not this is pretty much what we do, but we noticed that when we align towards l2-3 - the robot aligns it self to the wrong position, when we check the odometry it reports that the robot is at the correct position even though it isn’t there. It doesn’t happen when we align towards l4, towards l4 we need to keep a distance from the reef (it still doesn’t see the april tag but the robot has less time without vision) and when we align to l4 the robot aligns to the correct position. Due to the fact that towards l2-3 the robot aligns to the wrong position even though the odometry believes that it is in the correct position we believe that the problem is because the odometry itself struggles to get the correct position and if the limelight could see the april tag from closer it would solve the problem.",

Neither of ours are centered and one is pointed slightly downwards and the other is pointed slightly rightwards.\n\nBTW, I would recommend using CAD to determine your camera position & orientation over trial and error. Look up your camera’s horizontal and vertical Field Of View angles and draw a “pyramid” coming out of the lens using those values.  All of an April tag will need to fall within the pyramid to be seen.\n\nPS, do not make our mistake and assume your competition field(s) will be perfectly to spec – everything has a tolerance (eg +/- 0.5\").  Leave yourself some “slop”. That is, design based on the tag(s) being in the worst possible location for your robot. For example if the reef tag is in the left side of your FOV, assume it was placed 1/2\" left of center.",
