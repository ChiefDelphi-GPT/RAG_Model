It is powered via Rev’s POE injector cable which is connected directly to the second port of our robot’s old radio (not the new Vivid-Hosting one). Whenever the robot shakes (such as when it is accelerating very fast), it temporarily drops from the network, usually for about 3-5 mins.\n\nWe tried shaking the robot by hand while it was disabled and this issue still occurred, so we know it is not an electrical brownout issue from power being drawn by motors. We have also shaken the radio by hand and it didn’t occur, so we know it is not related to the radio vibrating as well. By checking the limelight’s ‘heartbeat’ ( hb on networktables), we are able to confirm that the limelight is only disconnecting from the network, and not completely power cycling.\n\nHas anyone had any issues like this, or have any suggestions? I’d hate to have to send it back.",

It may be that the cable has a break or other internal problem that causes one of the wires to not be connected when under high stress like shaking. This might well not interrupt the power to the Limelight, but cause the network signal to be disrupted.\n\nMake sure you aren’t just experiencing a disconnect problem at the network connectors. Get them seated properly, test that the Limelight is working correctly, then hot glue the connectors into place (on everything: the Limelight, the POE injector, the radio). This may well solve a problem like this where, just as above, a slightly loose connection might not cause the power to be cut off, but will interrupt the network signal.\n\nThose are my two cents on this. Most likely to be something simple like this, though it is remotely possible that there’s something loose inside the Limelight. Hopefully you can solve this without having to return it.",
