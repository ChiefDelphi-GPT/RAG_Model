I was looking around at FTC and VEX things, and I saw that some teams use two or three undriven Omni wheels with encoders that are pushed onto the ground so that they can use it for odometry ( here’s a website that explains it a bit ) I think this could probably be applied to FRC and would be helpful for detecting when your swerves are slipping and help by adding more data to the pose estimator. Have any teams tried/looked into this, or is it just not very practical or helpful? image 1920×1080 158 KB (credit to FTC team 15173 I think)\n\nimage 1920×1080 158 KB\n\nimage 1920×1080 158 KB",

FTC the fields are so small and the games made in such a way no wire runs are needed on the field. FRC is a bit different and in multiple games we have had rough terrain, wire covers and even a 1 inch metal bar near the endgame areas.\n\nMight be why we don’t see it nearly as much in FRC . It’s still a great idea for situations where you will be on a consistent level floor. With AprilTags maybe you can correct for the bumps now. But prior to their introduction it would’ve been really difficult with the retroflective tape markers.",

To add on, VEX / FTC have very different games and very different objectives with their games, in VEX / FTC most of the time, odometry tracking is only used in the auto portion. Meanwhile, in FRC , position tracking is needed for teleop and auto for other subsystems.\n\nIt is also really heavily dependent on the game; in Over Under (a 2023-2024 VEX game), many teams had their odometry “pods” but had to lift them up to get over the massive barriers on the field; some teams entirely avoided using the trackers for weight and space.\n\nDead Wheel Odom is good, but it does slip a lot (in VEX, I saw a team slip a whole foot because they collided with another robot), yes you could have it zero at specific points, but then it’s no better than using just the swerve pose estimator and zeroing. Going over obstacles and getting into collisions will cause it to lose its position fast. It will also take up a good amount of space under your drivetrain and add some unnecessary friction.\n\nFor its cost and benefit, using the PhotonVision Pipeline and a good co-processor with a camera might perform even better than the dead wheels with the swerve pose estimator; I might be wrong, though testing is the only way to find out.",

Therefore, dead wheel pods are a way to get something usable for autonomous. Similarly, VRC (from what I can tell) likes tank drivetrains of all omni wheels. Like FTC , the drivetrain includes drift/slip as a feature.\n\nThis is compared to FRC , where high traction swerve is the norm. Wheel slip is massively less compared to FTC or VRC , so you can get usable wheel odometry from the drive wheels, making separate wheels for odometry has largely irrelevant.",

We took copper coat hangers and turned them into large springs to keep the Odom pods down to the floor at all times. We had 3 pods, one on each side and one in the rear. As we were using X-Drive it’s closer to Mecanum style wheels and driving. It was designed around the Rev Throughbore hex encoders.

It was frustrating enough for us that we bailed on it pretty quickly and went back to swerve odometry.

Optical Flow Sensors!\n\nThis fancy optical flow sensor detects motion of surfaces in front of it, from ~80mm to infinity! It's great for DIY drone builds, and it's compatible with our new Breakout Garden HAT with SPI.\n\nThe PMW3901 is a crafty little sensor that uses a low-resolution camera and some clever algorithms to detect motion of surfaces. A great use for it is detecting and correcting for drift of a drone by looking for x/y motion of the ground below.\n\nThese are out of stock but the page explains it well. By analyzing the difference in pixels between super fast frames it can estimate X and Y position like an encoder sort of. Ever wonder how a drone is accurate when GPS isn’t down to the mm? When coupled with altimeter data you can know your Z and plot your change in Odom.\n\nMaybe this could be applied to FRC ?",

They need to have a high enough frame rate to actually follow visible elements in the image, so if you move too fast, they won’t be able to do that.  You’d have to do something further away with more texture (e.g. a field border), and at that point, why not use AprilTags, which won’t have false positives versus things like other robot movement?",

Something something “VIsual Odometery” pipeline coming to photonvision…\n\nSome napkin math analysis: As an upper bound, to do optical flow on highly regular (unmarked) carpet you need to track the weave movement; each weave is around 1/4\" so you likely need to capture 2-3 frames per quarter inch of movement?  With a robot moving at 20 feet/sec, that means you need (20 ft/sec) * (12 in/ft) * (3 frames / 0.25 in) = 2-3 thousand frames/sec.  This is likely overly conservative because carpet often has variation (marks etc) other than the weave, which would make this a lot more tractable–if the carpet has recognizable (even random smudges would do) markings ~4\" apart at most, you’d maybe only need 120-180 frames/sec to do optical flow on those markings.",
