                    "cooked": "Hello Chief Delphi! My name is Shoumik, and I am the driver for Team 8866. This past weekend, we participated at our Week 2 District Event in the PCH District: Dalton. However, we suffered many communication issues that inhibited our ability to perform. I’ll be the first to admit that our robot wasn’t as durable as it could be (especially the intake), but the amount of communication issues we faced in qualifications is something my team has never experienced before. If anyone could provide insight on what could have caused these issues and how we can mitigate it for our Week 4 District Event, I’d greatly appreciate it.\n\nI’ll be going over the issues I witnessed on the field during each of our qualification matches, which ranged from high latency to complete loss of communications (most of what I’ll be saying is from what I wrote down during the event or based off overhead replays).\n\nQuals 8: In this match, both of our teammates didn’t show, so we were in a 1v3. As seen in the overhead below (look at the bottom left), we grabbed a note, pivoted up our shooter, and then lost communications. https://youtu.be/gsgqvN-7b1Q?t=96 Quals 46: In this match, we died on the field (losing communications), but came back around 8 seconds later as seen in the overhead below (look at the blue stage). https://youtu.be/bng3cbzg6-E?t=130 Quals 51: In this match, we moved for around 5 seconds and then lost communications after our teammate hit us, as seen in the overhead below (though it wasn’t really that large of a hit). https://youtu.be/1oYGoWMQYsw?t=19 Quals 55: In this match, we had our gyro not reset properly (and refused to reset manually), but more importantly, we faced a large amount of lag between our controller inputs and the actions of the bot. As seen in the overhead below (near blue amp), we were acting sporadic and hitting 1102 (and blocking the amp), which wasn’t our intention. Later on in the match the high latency was fixed, but our gyro was still wrong, but that issue was fixed later on. https://youtu.be/ZF1PbQIck0w?t=31\n\nThroughout all our qualification matches, we were talking to volunteers and the CSA about our connectivity issues. We moved the radio to an easily visible place (on the swerve guards), and triple-checked that all our connections were intact. I should mention that we are using the Brainbox SW-005 as our Ethernet switch. Based on the responses to this thread, we may consider switching to a Netgear, as 1102 (who attended Dalton as well) stated in a post ( Brainbox Ethernet Switch Question / Match Issues ) that removing the Brainbox from the equation solved their connectivity problems (though they did have different connectivity problems as us). We never removed our Brainbox from the equation, as we needed it for our Limelight.\n\nDue to our communication issues (plus a variety of other issues), we ended up as the second seed to the fifth alliance. However, our two playoffs matches definitely did not go our way.\n\nPlayoffs 2: Our first playoffs match went pretty terribly. After the end of auto, we immediately lost communications and were dead on the field (as seen in the overhead below). After a bit, we would get communications back, move a couple inches, and then lose communications again. This led to us losing the match and dropping to the lower bracket. Though, we questioned box this match for a replay, we unfortunately did not get. We assessed all our wiring and the security of our cables, and everything seemed fine. https://youtu.be/BDOL8c5Obdo?t=22 Playoffs 5: Our second playoffs match started off with us working after teleop. We start cycling and decide to grab a note from the opposing alliance’s source. As we’re leaving their source, we hit the truss, and lose robot code (we survived much harder hits in the previous qualification matches). As seen in the overhead below, our RSL was blinking, and we still had robot communications, yet we didn’t have any robot code. We ended up losing that match, and were eliminated from the playoffs. We attempted to question box for a replay, but again, we were denied one. A CSA came by our pits to check our robot, and said two lines of code caused us to lose robot code (though our programmers said they were commented out). Overall, it was an extremely strange experience that my team hasn’t experienced before. https://youtu.be/0WIBxSdxXsk?t=88\n\ndalton 1920×2560 364 KB This was taken at the end of the match.\n\ndalton 1920×2560 364 KB\n\ndalton 1920×2560 364 KB\n\nOverall, the point of this post isn’t to complain about what happened at Dalton nor to contest the decisions of any referees, but instead to learn what caused these communication issues and how we can fix it going forward (since we’re now in jeopardy of not making it into DCMP ). Please let me know if I need to elaborate on anything else and thank you for reading!",

Without the log files of the problematic matches and a view of the robots electronics I can only give a general idea of what went wrong in the matches where you experienced a communication problem based on the timings: Quals 8: looks like a radio reboot. Quals 46: looks like a rio reboot. Quals 51: could be a radio reboot but 1:30 of disconnect time seems quite long to me. Quals 55: I have nothing smart to say about it based on the video… Playoffs 2: looks like multiple radio reboots. Playoffs 5: I guess you figured it out?\n\nIf you could share your log files from those matches I could look more into it and give a more precise answer. Also, pictures of the robot’s electrical connections would help. Mainly the radio power (both on radio and on VRM / RPM ), roboRio power and the matching connection on the PDP / PDH . Also, the battery connection and breaker.",

I’ll get the electrical pictures and the driver station logs uploaded soon, but I wanted to say that I made a mistake in my description for Playoffs 5. I meant to say that the programmers stated that those two lines of code were commented out, so we haven’t been able to figure out that issue yet. Once I get the electrical pictures and driver station logs, I’ll upload them as soon as possible!",

Quals 46: I see no communication issues in the logs but it seems there are many errors with a USB camera (although I don’t think this will cause communication issues). Quals 51: Looks like a radio reboot (and many errors with a USB camera again). Quals 55: Looks like in this match you have high latency and packet loss for some reason (and many errors with a USB camera again). Playoffs 2: Looks like multiple radio reboots and while connected you have high latency and packet loss for some reason. Playoffs 5: Your code indeed crashed (you can find the stack trace in the log, say if you need help finding it). Not sure why the Rio didn’t recover and restarted the code. Also, have you tried using the “reset robot code” button on your DS during this match (from the log it seems not, as there is not a code reset request, but I want to be sure). Also, you have high latency and packet loss again.\n\nI think this is all I can offer without seeing your robot electrical system. If your renovations also applies to your electronics and code maybe some of the issues have been fixed.",

We now have a 3D printed case (the 2056 one), which puts some distance between the module protector and radio.\n\nDuring Dalton, we had our Ethernet switch connected to a limelight, but now have it connected to an Orange Pi 5. It’s the same Ethernet switch as in Dalton, so we might try to see if we can ask teams to borrow a new one.\n\nWe swapped the roboRIO two nights ago, so that mainly fixed the comms issue, but last night we saw that we lose comms at around 1:30/12.3 V. It seemed like sudden acceleration from 0 to max caused us to loss comms. We have a comp today, but luckily another team offered to come and help (hopefully we’ll be able to get stuffed fixed). We’re theorizing that it might be a lose connection due to the nature of how communications is lost.\n\nGoogle Drive file.\n\nHere’s a video from this morning of us driving. You can see that the first “disconnect” is the driver station bugging. We suffered from this but at a higher severity two nights ago. Near the end, you can see that we that we lose comms.",

                    "cooked": "I’m assuming thats a swerve module under the radio? I’m familiar with any that have a cover like that, so I’m guessing that’s custom.   In either case, if theres a motor or gears directly below that plate, it might be generating enough EMI to interfere with the radio, which might be the cause of the high latency/dropped packets that @Omer_Huly mentioned.  If that happened before the radio was moved, then we’d need to know where it was previously before we could provide any concrete suggestions.\n\nI haven’t seen the logs myself, but based on the disconnects Omer mentioned seeing, if the radio stayed connected and the rio was dropping out, I’d be looking at that switch.  Especially if the dropouts were under 10 seconds.  BrainBox switches are decent and accept voltage input from 5-30V, but I don’t think they like handling 12V then 6V then 9V then 7.3V, etc.  I’ve seen this a few times in the last couple weeks, and if all the wiring is solid (including trying to swap out ethernet cables and stuff), then putting the switch on a VRM fixed nearly all of them.\n\nI also noticed you have a VRM in use with a couple things plugged in.  Can you tell us what they are?",
