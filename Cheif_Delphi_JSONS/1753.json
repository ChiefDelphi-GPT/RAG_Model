After just myself and @MatthewS had to load up everything for an off-season event, we knew it was time to upgrade. Our setup took 6+ people to get everything out of the trailer and moved to our pit in one trip. Once in the pit, chargers, extension cords, batteries, and shelving all needed to be dug out of their totes, and then setup before the team could begin working on robot inspection. It was easy to forget things back at home base, and if it wasn’t in the main toolbox, finding a spare part or larger tool meant digging through multiple FIRST totes to find it. If you needed a piece of raw material you had to rip apart the bundle and hopefully find what you needed. All of this takes time and adds to the stress of loading in and competing at events.\n\n72” Table provided by the venue\n\nHarbor Freight 27” 2-piece toolbox\n\nHardware Bin Cart\n\nMini Folding Table\n\n4+ FIRST Totes\n\nAir Compressor\n\nCollapsable Shelf\n\nMisc Loose Things\n\nRobot on Cart\n\n2X folding carts for moving all loose items\n\nPile of spare raw materials usually taped together into a bundle 20220310_193655 1920×1440 284 KB 20220319_183348 1920×2560 437 KB\n\n20220310_193655 1920×1440 284 KB\n\n20220310_193655 1920×1440 284 KB\n\n20220319_183348 1920×2560 437 KB\n\n20220319_183348 1920×2560 437 KB\n\nWe sat down and looked through my 15 years of robotics photos and over 30 team’s pit setups to make a checklist of wants and needs for our own SuperPit. Our main pit structure was going to be the third generation of square tube frame SuperPit started by 973 in 2014, and improved upon by @MatthewS on 5460 in 2018. We chose this route because we could mig weld the steel (yes they are steel) frames ourselves, and this style of SuperPit would give us the best bang for our buck.\n\nFit into a 102”x102” pit since Michigan is known to have some tight pits at events.\n\n24” max workbench depth for maximum robot space in the middle.\n\nFit into a 7’x14’ trailer with a 72” tall ramp door opening.\n\nNot require 120v power to set up.\n\nNot require any heavy lifting to set up.\n\nRequire minimal setup to be ready for use. This includes not needing to use any tools to set up the pit.\n\nPack up into as minimal a number of separate pieces as possible.\n\n5” diameter heavy duty casters for longevity and to make pushing across the plastic tile floor at MSC as smooth as possible.\n\nA corner cart to make the sometimes not accessible corner area as useful as possible.\n\nFirst order retrievability for as many parts and tools as possible. Aka, not having to move something to get to something else.\n\nRequire only 1 power outlet to supply the pit with power\n\nHave overhead lighting, free use outlets, dedicated outlets, and testing tools all built into the structure, so everything is ready at the flip of a switch.\n\nHave a place for phones and other small items that end up sitting out on the workbench.\n\nUse a standard 46” toolbox for the main tool storage.\n\nA 21” x 73” x 5” drawer for storing 72” sticks of raw materials and sheet goods.\n\nA 42” TV for match live streams.\n\nDelrin tube inserts and side guides on the vertical extension tubes to reduce friction\n\nHigh quality design and build within a reasonable budget.\n\nAfter at least a month of brainstorming and 3D design in SolidWorks, we were ready to melt some metal. During the design phase we had been calling vendors looking for sponsorships to help pay for or provide products for our SuperPit. We were able to get the following donated.\n\nESE LLC - Build space and use of CNC and manual machine tools\n\nDCS Water Jet Cutting, Inc. - Cutting and bending sheet metal trim pieces and material drawer\n\nColson Caster - 12X 5” heavy duty casters\n\nPremier Powder Coating - Black and Color Matched Gray powder coat\n\nOver 225 man-hours were spent cutting, welding, grinding, wiring, and assembling the three main pieces. We finished 95% of the SuperPit before the kickoff of the 2024 season. During the 2024 build season we had to button up the wiring, Battery Cart assembly, and install the sheet metal trim. After our normal Saturday kickoff meeting, the majority of the team stayed longer to start organizing parts and hardware into their new home in the SuperPit. Our old pit setup fit into a single axle 6x12 trailer with a rear door and no ramp. Before we began building the SuperPit we determined that it would be easier to build a SuperPit in the off-season and then figure out a trailer later or borrow one if needed to move it to competitions during the 2024 season. We ended up using my single axle 6x10 trailer and the team’s 6x12 single axle trailer to move everything. My trailer was not rated for the fully loaded SuperPits, so we removed the battery cart and FIRST totes, and put them along with the robot and TV cart in the team’s old trailer.\n\n4X Albion (Colson) 1050 Lb capacity Swivel Caster Pit Carts 1 & 2 have 2X swivel locks for trailer loading\n\nPit Carts 1 & 2 have 2X swivel locks for trailer loading\n\n2X 1000 Lb Weld on D-Rings for Trailer Tie Downs\n\nSteel Square Tube frame Construction\n\n¼” HDPE over ¾” plywood bench top\n\n¼” HDPE rear enclosure panels\n\n14” 12v Electric actuators on Carts 1 and 2 Gas shocks carry majority of the weight\n\nGas shocks carry majority of the weight\n\nExternal Anderson SB50 connectors for lift actuator power RV Slideout toggle switches for controlling the actuators\n\nRV Slideout toggle switches for controlling the actuators\n\nE-Stop Switches in each corner to quickly turn off all pit 120 volt functions\n\n5660 SuperPit BOM .xlsx (27.6 KB) BOM does not include the SuperSnack Cart 5660 SuperPit Schematics.pdf (204.6 KB)\n\nCAD 1027×729 127 KB 1B1A0086 1920×1280 218 KB 1B1A0028 1920×1280 243 KB 1B1A1609 1920×1280 223 KB 20241212_205643 1920×1440 438 KB 20240327_191444 1920×2560 570 KB\n\nCAD 1027×729 127 KB\n\nCAD 1027×729 127 KB\n\n1B1A0086 1920×1280 218 KB\n\n1B1A0086 1920×1280 218 KB\n\n1B1A0028 1920×1280 243 KB\n\n1B1A0028 1920×1280 243 KB\n\n1B1A1609 1920×1280 223 KB\n\n1B1A1609 1920×1280 223 KB\n\n20241212_205643 1920×1440 438 KB\n\n20241212_205643 1920×1440 438 KB\n\n20240327_191444 1920×2560 570 KB\n\n20240327_191444 1920×2560 570 KB\n\n8X easy access outlets\n\n12 volt Anderson 1327 hookup for component benchtop testing\n\n¼” Push-Connect Pneumatic Testing Station\n\n46” Kobalt Toolbox for all high use tools\n\nRemovable 12 Battery cart\n\n4” Swivel Bench Vise\n\nHidden trash bin\n\nHigh use nut and bolt hardware storage\n\nHigh Priority spare standard parts storage\n\nNotebook Cubby\n\n72” LED Bench Light 1B1A0034 1920×2880 374 KB 1B1A0065 1920×1280 189 KB\n\n1B1A0034 1920×2880 374 KB\n\n1B1A0034 1920×2880 374 KB\n\n1B1A0065 1920×1280 189 KB\n\n1B1A0065 1920×1280 189 KB\n\n73” x 21” x 5” drawer for spare raw materials 8X Soft Close Drawer slides Latching Handle\n\n8X Soft Close Drawer slides\n\nLatching Handle\n\n2 Gallon Quiet Air Compressor\n\nMini Refrigerator\n\nIncoming Power voltage display\n\nPit Power Amp draw meter\n\n4X FIRST Totes for larger spare parts and other low use items\n\n26’ x 1/4” Air Hose Reel\n\n50’ 3-Plug Cord Reel\n\n5X easy access outlets including 2X USB outlets\n\n12 volt Anderson 1327 hookup for component benchtop testing\n\nPhone Shelf\n\nPaper Towel Rack\n\nLow Use hardware storage\n\nLow Priority spare parts and tools storage\n\nMatch Schedule Board\n\n72” LED Bench Light 1B1A0045 1920×2880 336 KB\n\n1B1A0045 1920×2880 336 KB\n\n1B1A0045 1920×2880 336 KB\n\n42” Fire TV with Twitch app\n\n600mm 12V Electric Actuator for majority of TV Lift\n\nCustom 4-Bar lift for additional 14.625” of TV lift 2X 2.4” 15Lb gas shocks for TV 4-Bar Lift\n\n2X 2.4” 15Lb gas shocks for TV 4-Bar Lift\n\nSealed bottom main frame tubes with npt plugs for 30lb of lead shot ballast\n\nFront and top doors for storage access in any pit configuration\n\nTV & PC power outlet\n\nHDMI cable for laptop hookup 20231206_212708 1920×2560 510 KB 20231204_180005 1920×2560 438 KB 20250307_171032(0) 1920×2560 581 KB\n\n20231206_212708 1920×2560 510 KB\n\n20231206_212708 1920×2560 510 KB\n\n20231204_180005 1920×2560 438 KB\n\n20231204_180005 1920×2560 438 KB\n\n20250307_171032(0) 1920×2560 581 KB\n\n20250307_171032(0) 1920×2560 581 KB\n\nAfter seeing multiple teams at MSC with shelving setup in the lunch areas in 2023, and 5612 snack cart in 2024, we decided to build our own while finishing up the 2025 robot. Typically in the lunch area of a competition the cooler is on the ground taking up floor space. We built the shelving unit over the cooler to use the air space above it for storage so the table can be clear for food. This allows one person to bring a large cooler and all of the snacks to the lunch area in one trip. One benefit of being a smaller team is we can fit a competition weekend worth of snacks, plates, silverware, and cups, in a small cart like this.\n\n57” Overall Height for easy pushing through a crowded gym\n\nIgloo Marine Ultra 70 Qt Cooler Tall enough for 2-liter bottles to stand up Opens far enough to remove 2-liter while in the cart\n\nTall enough for 2-liter bottles to stand up\n\nOpens far enough to remove 2-liter while in the cart\n\n4X Harbor Freight 5” Rubber Swivel Casters\n\nULine 18”x36” Mobile Shelving Cover shortened by 13”\n\n9X Sterilite 16 Qt Clear Snap Top Bins\n\n2x1 steel tube base and 1x1 angle iron upper structure 20230406_162910 1920×1440 186 KB 20250201_203640 1920×2560 757 KB SuperSnack 557×851 38.3 KB 20250610_193444 1920×2560 719 KB 20250610_193409 1920×2560 620 KB 20250610_193327 1920×2560 371 KB 6936327895509936883 1537×2047 462 KB\n\n20230406_162910 1920×1440 186 KB\n\n20230406_162910 1920×1440 186 KB\n\n20250201_203640 1920×2560 757 KB\n\n20250201_203640 1920×2560 757 KB\n\nSuperSnack 557×851 38.3 KB\n\nSuperSnack 557×851 38.3 KB\n\n20250610_193444 1920×2560 719 KB\n\n20250610_193444 1920×2560 719 KB\n\n20250610_193409 1920×2560 620 KB\n\n20250610_193409 1920×2560 620 KB\n\n20250610_193327 1920×2560 371 KB\n\n20250610_193327 1920×2560 371 KB\n\n6936327895509936883 1537×2047 462 KB\n\n6936327895509936883 1537×2047 462 KB\n\n20230807_115146 1920×2560 439 KB 20230818_182611 1920×1440 209 KB 20230912_181950 1920×1440 224 KB 20231121_175302 1920×2560 417 KB 20231121_175239 1920×1440 398 KB 20241007_185020 1920×2560 789 KB 20231213_210712 1920×1440 303 KB\n\n20230807_115146 1920×2560 439 KB\n\n20230807_115146 1920×2560 439 KB\n\n20230818_182611 1920×1440 209 KB\n\n20230818_182611 1920×1440 209 KB\n\n20230912_181950 1920×1440 224 KB\n\n20230912_181950 1920×1440 224 KB\n\n20231121_175302 1920×2560 417 KB\n\n20231121_175302 1920×2560 417 KB\n\n20231121_175239 1920×1440 398 KB\n\n20231121_175239 1920×1440 398 KB\n\n20241007_185020 1920×2560 789 KB\n\n20241007_185020 1920×2560 789 KB\n\n20231213_210712 1920×1440 303 KB\n\n20231213_210712 1920×1440 303 KB\n\nWe modified how the Tote shelf was mounted to the frame to lower it by ½”. With the plywood over top of the horizontal tubes , you could not remove the top tote without sliding the lower tote part way out.\n\nThe aluminum tubing for the electrical was originally ⅛” x 2” square tubing. This makes it difficult to fit all of the circuits and almost impossible to fit USB outlets due to their depth. We replaced the short piece of tubing under the phone shelf with a piece of ⅛” x 2x3 tubing so we could add some USB outlets under the phone shelf.\n\nThe original material drawer was bent out of one piece of 20 Gauge mild steel with a hemmed top edge and bracing welded inside. We had problems with warping while welding in the bracing, which then made installing and aligning the 8X drawer slides a hassle. The fix for this was to weld a skeleton of the drawer using ½” square tubing and then rivet the sheetmetal to that before stitch welding them all into one piece. This version of the drawer is able to be opened and closed with one hand.\n\nA Michigan team contracted myself and @MatthewS to weld them a set of SuperPit frames in September of 2024. After having built ours, we made the upgrades listed above to theirs and we were also able to build it faster using better manufacturing techniques. Total time to go from 24’ sticks of raw material to the welded frames ready for powder coat was 106 man hours. 20241004_161932 1920×2560 559 KB 20241111_170748 1920×1440 376 KB 20241112_183746 1920×1440 365 KB\n\n20241004_161932 1920×2560 559 KB\n\n20241004_161932 1920×2560 559 KB\n\n20241111_170748 1920×1440 376 KB\n\n20241111_170748 1920×1440 376 KB\n\n20241112_183746 1920×1440 365 KB\n\n20241112_183746 1920×1440 365 KB\n\nOur SuperPits are made of a welded steel 14 gauge tubing main frame, which sounds heavy, but actually isn’t that bad when you look at the final weights.\n\n7x14 Vee Nose Trailer\n\nRobot Cart On Passenger SIde Vee Robot Mounted to Robot Cart\n\nRobot Mounted to Robot Cart\n\nTV Cart on Drivers Side Vee Shipping Blanket protects it from the wall\n\nShipping Blanket protects it from the wall\n\nToolbox Cart on Drivers side\n\nDrawer Cart on Passenger Side\n\nSuperSnack Cart on Drivers Side Shipping Blanket protects it from the wall\n\nShipping Blanket protects it from the wall\n\nPassenger side door is not obstructed and is still usable\n\nTrailer Weight - 1975 Lb\n\nToolbox Cart - 1159 Lb\n\nDrawer Cart - 852 Lb\n\nTV Cart - 191 Lb\n\nRobot & Cart - 227 Lb\n\nSuperSnack Cart - 239 Lb Total Weight Pulled By Tow Vehicle - 4643 Lb Trailer Loaded 1500×2000 343 KB Trailer Loaded Top View 1525×840 72.7 KB\n\nTrailer Loaded 1500×2000 343 KB\n\nTrailer Loaded 1500×2000 343 KB\n\nTrailer Loaded Top View 1525×840 72.7 KB\n\nTrailer Loaded Top View 1525×840 72.7 KB\n\nAfter two seasons of use, there have not been any issues or “I wish we did that’s”.
