We can use that functionality ourselves - without needing all the virtual thread stuff - and use it to implement coroutines and async/await functionality for a command based framework.\n\nBasically, it allows for commands to written almost like a normal function - standard Java control flow like if statements and while loops are possible and encouraged.\n\nFor example, a simple command in v2 that sets a motor until some setpoint target is reached, then turns off the motor would look like this:\n\nWhich needs knowledge of how command functions are handled (init, execute, end condition, completion/cleanup) and the DSL methods to do so.\n\nIn v3, the same command would just use a normal while loop with a coroutine to manage pausing and resuming - it must be cooperative multitasking - but otherwise is just normal Java code.\n\nThis is fairly similar between both frameworks because all the logic is in a periodic function. The only change is that V3 moves the logic to an explicit while loop with a yield call, while V2 relies on the scheduler running its body once per robot loop.\n\nMoving an elevator to a specific reef level, then scoring a piece of coral. Note how v2 needs to make use of multiple proxies in an awkward parallel group at the start of the command, while v3 can just use the coroutine to fork them in a single function body. This is because the v3 scheduler keeps track of every running command, instead of having parallel and sequential groups manage their commands internally, allowing the scheduler to prevent inner commands from interrupting their parents.",

It feels wrong to require adding something to my code that has no actual meaning in terms of the command’s logic. What’s even worse is that if I somehow forget to add this single line, MY ROBOT WILL EXPLODE . And I get absolutely zero warning or error about it during compile or deploy.\n\nIt’s also very hard to explain coroutine.fork() and coroutine.yield() to a junior programmer without giving them a big lecture about signals and threading. The new API forces students to always add something that they don’t truly understand to their code, and missing it leads to catastrophic consequences.\n\nAnd frankly, I don’t see the upside.\n\nYou said that the V2 Commands library requires students to understand\n\nSamCarlberg:\n\nhow command functions are handled\n\n, but those concepts are simple; I can teach them to new team members in 5 minutes.\n\nAnd composing command logic in CommandsV2 can be elegant and clean.\n\nThe scoring command that you’ve mentioned can be written as:\n\nSuch code just looks so beautiful and reads like natural language.\n\nIf the advantage of the new API is simply allowing the use of native if and while inside commands, it feels like not worth its price.",

And I get absolutely zero warning or error about it during compile or deploy.\n\nYep. That’s the glaring footgun with the coroutine-first approach; there’s no way to check at compile time so it’s up to the programmer to be aware of it. A watchdog will be necessary to detect misbehaving commands and throw an exception if one is taking too much time before yielding (continuations aren’t threadsafe, so I don’t think it’s possible to do something like forcibly unmounting a running command from a different thread, though future Java updates might change that).\n\nMaybe it’s useful if you consider coroutine.yield() to be analogous to Thread.sleep(20)\n\ncatrix:\n\nThe scoring command that you’ve mentioned can be written as:\n\nNot quite - the elevator is uncommanded during the coral scoring command at the end. If you use onboard motor control, then the elevator could sag (you’d have to use something like coral.scoreAtLevel(level).deadlineFor(elevator.holdLastKnownSetpoint()) , which isn’t obvious).\n\ncatrix:\n\nSuch code just looks so beautiful and reads like natural language.\n\nThat’s if you’re used to the DSL - but I generally agree that it’s better to express intent in your code than implementation (ie, declarative programming > imperative programming). The issue with DSLs, though, is that there’s a learning curve to the syntax and framework behavior, and that’s not always easy.\n\nThere will still be DSL-like decorators and builders in v3 like until , withTimeout , alongWith , etc, and - because they’re a higher-level part of the framework - don’t particularly care about how commands are implemented at a lower level.\n\nIt’s pretty easy to add a v2-like shim layer if you really want (see below); though I’m not yet convinced that we’d want something like this included in the library. Convenience factories for simple looping commands (eg Command.loop(Runnable) I think would be good fits, but if you’re doing something more complicated - that’s where coroutines are more powerful",

Transitioning from a v2 project should be easy and safe.\n\nThink of the new coroutine syntax as a more expressive alternative to the current ProxyCommand.  It lets you write code that is somewhat more-granular, at the cost of sharper edges.\n\nThe relation between continuation/coroutine-style commands and fluent/decorator-style commands is similar to the relationship between async/await and promise-chaining.  Typically you want to be able to do both, since they’re good at different things.",

These currently must be manually wrapped in `CoroutineCommand`s\n- [ ] Tests\n- [ ] Docs\n\n## Overview\n\nAdd support for coroutines into commands2. These coroutines are compatible with commands. Coroutines can be converted to Commands and Commands can be converted to coroutines.\n\nNote: \"Coroutine\" in this PR and impl act as coroutines for the purposes of FRC but are actually generators. This PR does **not** add support for any async/await. Coroutines have been implemented as generators so they can run synchronously with robot code and can be managed by the CommandScheduler loop (instead of asyncio).\n\n## Usage\n\n### Buttons/Triggers\nButtons and Triggers currently accept `Command`s and functions (`Callable[[], None]`). This has been expanded to accept generators and generator functions.\n\nButtons have been moved to a Python implementation and `Trigger` has been partially moved (the exposed `Trigger` is Python that encapsulates the c++ `Trigger`) to facilitate this. This is because most of `Trigger`'s methods have to have multiple return types to support both decorator and non-decorator forms. \n\n#### Generator\n```py\nb: Button\n\ndef generator_command():\n\twhile True:\n\t\tprint(i)\n\t\tyield\n\ng = generator_command()\n\nb.whenPressed(g)\n```\nWarning: While this is supported, it is not recommended. Python does not allow for generators to be copied. The workaround, `tee` can potentially use infinite memory. Because of this, coroutines bound this way can only be used once. The above snippet would only work the first time the button is pressed.\n\n#### Generator Function\n\n```py\nb: Button\n\ndef generator_command():\n\twhile True:\n\t\tprint(i)\n\t\tyield\n\nb.whenPressed(generator_command)\n```\nThis is the recommended way to pass in generators in the non-decorator style. Using a function with no params (`Callable[[], Generator[None, None, None]`) that builds the generator. The internally used `CoroutineCommand` saves this function and rebuilds the generator each time `.initialize()` is called.\n\n### Buttons/Trigger as decorators\nAll `Callables` accepted by buttons and triggers can also be passed in by using it as a decorator. This style is how flask, fastapi, and Swift (Trailing Closure Syntax) do things.\n\n#### Functions\n```py\nb: Button\n\n# Ex 1\n@b.whenPressed\ndef _():\n\tprint(1)\n\n# Ex 2\n@b.whenPressed()\ndef _():\n\tprint(2)\n\n# Ex 3\n@b.whenPressed(interruptible=False)\ndef _():\n\tprint(3)\n\n# Ex 4\n@b.whenPressed(requirements=[robot.drivetrain])\ndef _():\n\tprint(4)\n```\n\n#### Generator Functions\nAll 4 example arguments as above work but only the \"Ex 1\" form is shown.\n\n```py\nb: Button\n\n@b.whenPressed\ndef _():\n\twhile True:\n\t\tprint(i)\n\t\tyield\n```\n\n[Simple Example in 2022 Robot Code](https://github.com/CtrlZ-FRC4096/Robot-2022-Public/blob/main/robot/oi.py#L167-L169)\n[Complex Example in 2022 Robot Code](https://github.com/CtrlZ-FRC4096/Robot-2022-Public/blob/main/robot/oi.py#L123-L134)\n\n### Composing Coroutines\nIn the current command framework, commands are composed using extra classes (`ParallelCommandGroup`, `SequentialCommandGroup`, etc.) or using helper functions (`.andThen(...)`, etc.). \nCoroutines aren't natively supported by these constructors (yet?) and must be wrapped in `CoroutineCommand` to enable this.\n\nBut, coroutines can be composed within themselves using `yield from`.\n```py\ndef a():\n\tfor i in range(10):\n\t\tyield\n\ndef b():\n\tprint(1)\n\tyield\n\tprint(2)\n\tyield from a() # this runs a until it's complete (each yield in a() still applies of course)\n```\nFurthermore, since coroutines are generators with no input, they can be used as iterables.\n```py\nyield from a()\n```\nis equivalent to\n```py\nfor _ in a():\n\tyield\n```\nfor the purposes of this framework.\n\n[Very Complex Example in 2022 Robot Code (Untested)](https://github.com/CtrlZ-FRC4096/Robot-2022-Public/blob/main/robot/oi.py#L265-L336)\n\nSo, to run coroutines in parallel and move on when any one command finishes:\n```py\ndef c():\n\tfor _ in zip(a(), b()):\n\t\tyield\n```\n\n### Converting Coroutines to Commands\n#### commandify\nThe `@commandify` decorator lets commands be written as coroutines and be exposed as commands currently are.\n\n```py\n@commandify\ndef MyCommand(i, j):\n\tprint(i)\n\tyield\n\tprint(j)\n```\n\nThe signature of MyCommand is now `(i, j) -> CoroutineCommand`\n\n```py\ncommand: CoroutineCommand = MyCommand(1,2)\n```\n\nRequirements can be passed into `commandify` as\n```py\n@commandify(requirements = [robot.climber])\n```\n\nNote that the access time of requirements has changed.\nIn the new style (above), requirements are saved when the file is parsed.\nIn the old style, requirements are saved when the command is constructed:\n```py\nclass C(CommandBase):\n\tdef __init__(self):\n\t\tself.addRequirements(...)\n```\n\nBecause of this, commands with requirements created using `commandify` must be defined in a scope where the robot object has already been created (in the subsystem object for example).\n\n#### CoroutineCommand\nThe `CoroutineCommand` class's constructor can be used to convert coroutines to commands. This way, coroutine functions defined in code stay as coroutine functions can be converted to commands as needed.\n```py\ndef coro_no_params():\n\tprint(1)\n\tyield\n\ndef coro_params(i, j):\n\tprint(i)\n\tyield\n\tprint(j)\n\n# Ex 1\ncmd = CoroutineCommand(coro_no_params())\n# Not Recommended. A generator has been passed. This command cannot be reused.\n\n# Ex 2\ncmd = CoroutineCommand(coro_no_params)\n# Recommended. A generator function has been passed. This command can be reused.\n\n# Ex 3\ncmd = CoroutineCommand(coro_params(1, 2))\n# Not recommended. A generator has been passed. This command cannot be reused.\n\n# Ex 4\ncmd = CoroutineCommand(lambda: coro_params(1,2))\n# Recommended. A generator function has been passed. This command can be reused.\n```\n\n### Converting Commands to Coroutines\nAll `Command` and it's subclasses are now iterable. Calling `command_obj.__iter__()` returns an iterable that will only exhaust when the command's `isFinished` returns `True`.\nA coroutine is created with `command_obj.__iter__()`.\nA coroutine function is created with `command_obj.__iter__`.\n\n### Using `Command`s *in* coroutines\n#### Manual calls\n`Command`'s initialize, execute, and isFinished can be manually called.\n```py\ndef a():\n\tcmd = MyCommand()\n\tcmd.initialize()\n\twhile not cmd.isFinished():\n\t\tcmd.execute()\n\t\tyield\n```\n#### Yield from\nVia the `__iter__` added to `Command`, `Command`s can be yielded from in coroutines.\n```py\ndef a():\n\tcmd = MyCommand()\n\tyield from cmd\n\n# OR\n\ndef a():\n\tyield from MyCommand() # todo: make sure the command isn't destroyed by c++ before it finishes.\n```\n\nStill todo\n- [x] Add support for `runsWhenDisabled` in the constructor\n- [ ] A … ccept coroutines in helper functions (`.andThen`, etc.) and `Subsystem.setDefaultCommand`?

I’m more accustomed to using coroutines in a non-real-time context, where the constraints are somewhat different.\n\nAre we likely to see an end to the assumption that all commands run on the same (currently 20ms) cycle? Could there be a case for multiple yields in a command’s main loop? Will long-running tasks (e.g. the dreaded LiveWindows update) get extra yields?",

But I have found that teaching the “your Runnable will be looped for you” paradigm is not hard compared to all the other things you need to teach to code a functional robot.\n\nI much prefer the world where there’s consistent, compile-time enforced control by default as opposed to expecting students to remember to thoughtfully place coroutine.yield() calls inside mandatory for/while loops.\n\nI am sure there are some complex cases where having more fine-grained control over Command flow may be beneficial (we rolled our own composite commands this year for precisely this purpose), but switching the default seems to me like it’s handing out semi-automatic footguns for little benefit.\n\n(Note that other V3 improvements like asProxy-by-default and improved telemetry sound great to me)",
