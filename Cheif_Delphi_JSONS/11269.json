Take a look at this github issue where we discuss it: Red Alliance - Invert Path Y Value · Issue #207 · mjansen4857/pathplanner · GitHub\n\nWhat’s happening is, the FRC standard is that the (0, 0) origin point is defined as the right corner of your alliance station wall. So on the field, when you’re standing behind the alliance wall, (0, 0) will always be to your right for both the blue and red alliance. If you’re looking at the field from a top down perspective where blue alliance is on the left, when you are on the blue alliance, the origin is in the bottom left, with 0 degrees pointing right. When on the red alliance, the origin is in the top right, with 0 degrees to the left.\n\nBecause of this, to transform a path created relative to the blue alliance to the red alliance, it is flipped around the field X axis. Combining this with the 180 degree rotation around the center of the field caused by changing the origin point, you get something that is an equivalent to flipping around the Y axis.",

                    "cooked": "This keeps coming up and I think where people are getting confused is in the word flipping and mirroring, and the fact that it doesn’t matter if you are red or blue, that 0,0 is against your alliance wall on the right hand side of the field as you look down the field from your alliance wall.\n\nFor a path that is designed for the blue side of the field for the blue alliance (which is the recommendation way to make paths in PathPlanner) to work when you are Red alliance, you leave all the x values as they are, make the y values equal to “field width” -y value and swap the sign on all the angles, both path heading angles and holonomic rotation values.\n\nTo help visualise, Imagine this. You are blue alliance and your robot is roughly in front of April tag # 8 at say approx x=1, y=1 and say the robot is facing the corner of the field that is nearest to the tag, so this would indicate a holonomic rotation of -135 degrees. The robot is to move down the field and to the left 1 meter and rotate until its facing straight down the field.  So the path heading is 45 degree and the finishing position would be at 2,2 with a holonomic rotation of 0 degrees.\n\nNow leave this path where it is and rotate the image of the field so that the red alliance wall is now where the blue alliance wall was.  The 0,0 point for red is the same bottom right corner of the field.  But for this path to work as it did when your blue.  All the y values need to moved to the other side of the field.  Lets say the field is 8 metres wide. The 1,1 point used before when you were blue will become (1,8-1) which equals (1,7).  X value stays the same, y value changes. The robot needs to be face the corner closest to where the robot is located, so the starting holonomic rotation is negated to +135.  And the robot now needs to move down the field and to the right 1 meter to the new point (2,8-2) =(2,6) and the direction that the path is heading in is -45 degrees. and when it get there it is facing down the field at 0 degrees.  So all the angles are just negated (not 180 minus), all x values are left untouched and all y value become field width minus y value.  So everything is all good, and the y values are supposed to mirrored on x.\n\nIt took me a while to get this as well, but rotating the field image in your head and leaving the paths where they are makes it easier to understand why the Y values are the values that need to be changed and the angles only need to be negated.",

The work around for this is to make your command code target to Tags A & B & C.  With A being the Tag that is closest to the field perimeter and C being the tag closest to the divider between the two zones.  Then inside the logic of these commands you works out the correct tag number to target based on the alliance colour.\n\nFor example if your command code targeted to Tag A, the logic in the command would evaluate to Target 8 if you were blue and Target 1 if you were red.\n\nThis one work around will save you all the pain of running a fixed 0,0 origin.\n\nAlso with the system you are proposing with only blue (0,0), are the driver on Red alliance going to turn their joysticks around and operate them backwards?",
