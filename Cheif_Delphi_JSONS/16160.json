                    "cooked": "Hi everyone,\n\nOur 2021 bunnybot featured a belt driven intake. However, due a design error, the belt was moderately under-tensioned. (Image below) image 828×1792 5.96 MB\n\nimage 828×1792 5.96 MB\n\nimage 828×1792 5.96 MB\n\nDuring the general craziness of matches, the outer flange of one of the pulleys was knocked off. We noticed this in the queue for our next match and mentally prepared ourselves for the belt inevitably falling off during our the match. But, we were surprised to find that the belt stayed on the damaged pulley for the two high contact matches it took us to get a replacement.\n\nI’m wondering if the under-tensioning of the belt played any role in the belt remaining on the pulley (perhaps due to the crown pulley effect)?  And if it might be useful to deliberately under-tension similar low load intake belts in the future?\n\nThanks for any help or perspective you can give!",

I’m not sure from your image if it’ll act as a clutch, as some teams do intentionally, but you’ll be reducing the current draw when running idle (something intakes do often) and likely not suffering any consequences. A loose belt as a clutch can wear down, but I haven’t seen that alone become an issue over the course of a season.\n\nIt likely played into the belt not slipping off, but I’ve also seen properly and over-tensioned belts stay on flangeless pullies. Iirc there’s some formulas that can be applied there based on belt length and other factors, mostly for industrial and automotive stuff.\n\nI despise the classic aluminum pulley flange ejection as it becomes sometimes, and recommend 3d printing a simple disc or something as a retainer. Or even the whole pulley if you’d like, they usually work fine on intakes.",

Especially if you have 3 or 4 successive belt runs, moving the pulleys closer by 0.03\" to 0.06\" makes the mechanism much more efficient at the cost of drive strength. I believe 254 did this on their 2017 hopper to avoid overcurrent issues with so many driven belts.",
