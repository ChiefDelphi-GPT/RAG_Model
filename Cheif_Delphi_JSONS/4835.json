                    "cooked": "I have been working on ball drive for a while and have had some traction problem driving a ball directly (still working on it) So for now I decided to do a prototype based on this\n\nOnly with 6 in balls and in xdrive configuration. To allow to clear obstacles fwd and back and side to side. The achilles heel for clearing obstacles is if you take them on at exactly a 45 deg diagonal or within 3-4 deg of that but that is avoidable or could be taken care of with a skid plate if necessary - I lean towards taking obstacles on head on It should easily clear 2 in obstacles as the radius of a 6 in wheel/ball is 3 in and above 2 in height you kinda ram it - its a question of sin and cos lol.\n\nSo here is where I am at. PXL_20241224_2201422841 1920×1446 219 KB now more detail… PXL_20241224_191115857.MP1 1920×1446 147 KB Starting of with a 304 steel bar (I picked it cause it flexes less than mild steel or aluminum) 1/8 in thick with some holes drilled in it PXL_20241224_1936232741 1920×1446 188 KB insert into a matching 3dp (either petg or abs probably abs as I got an enclosed printer with heated chamber now ) So the holes were drilled on a drill press with a 3dp template to ensure accuracy. The first version I used the 3dp axle plate as a template - not a good idea - works great with aluminum but the 304 got to hot and damaged the plastic even with oil. PXL_20241224_1936504781 1920×2550 277 KB Holders with 6806 bearings PXL_20241224_1938386981 1920×1446 206 KB First measuring try in the holder. This is temporary. I probably either (preferably) make it out of fiberglass or CF or print it fatter. Quite sufficient for prototyping but not if they put a 4 in high steel bar across the field again and you take it on full speed or through rough terrain. Even though quite a few local coaches said FIRST would not dare rough terrain as that is no good for swerve and a lot of companies make a lot of $$$ selling swerve and donate a lot to FIRST so as FIRST needs $$$ no action that messes with the profit line of vendors. PXL_20241224_2007474721 1920×2550 489 KB Mount 625 bearings as rollers on the semisphers. They take the job of Thrust bearings vertically down PXL_20241224_2035289581 1920×1446 236 KB Sitting in the axle rases. The bolts that douple as axles (M5) for the bearings will be countersunk as soon as they arrive so further in. PXL_20241224_205619385.MP1 1920×2550 232 KB Assenbke the little top wheel in case you are going exactly on a 45 on flat ground PXL_20241224_2134378661 1920×2550 324 KB Mount the first base for the 6806 bearing that is parallel to the axle and perpendicular to the 625s So we got a bearing set in each direction the 6806 will als keep the semisphere from falling off PXL_20241224_2134447091 1920×2550 353 KB The countersunk bolts sticking through the 304 steel axle and the 3dp axle race. PXL_20241224_2139294151 1920×2550 306 KB Both Mounted. One side has the head of the bolts countersunk the other has the nuts press fitted into it the material is TPU 95A to give some shock absorbtion. it also holds the press fit nuts for the “little wheel” mount PXL_20241224_214306386.MP1 1920×1446 158 KB insert the 6806 bearings on each side PXL_20241224_2154102961 1920×2550 571 KB And mount the wheel using an allen key wrench there is access to the head of the bolt the other side is printed in a mirror so the little wheels pint in the direction of the axle PXL_20241224_2201422841 1920×1446 219 KB Here is the whole assembly so far. Its intended to mount below a frame using in my case 2x1 U channel and gives 4 in clearance using the conical skid if you get to a 4 in tall obstacle. I am in the process of making an octagonal frame out of 2x1 u (always wanted to do one rn I am ordering parts) If you have a low rider like last year the top of the 2x1 sits at 6 in so theoretically you can mount the top of the bumpers flush with it with a 1 in ground clearance or higher depending on bumper rules. The Gear on the long end will interface with a gearbox I am making that can be configured by picking gears from 8.2 to one down as low as your heart desires, The gear could also be replaced with a HTD pulley of about 40ish gears. The mount has the hole pattern of an andymark hub So you could mount an andymark pulley. The motor will sit in my case on top of the ball  a little to the side with clearance of course so on top of the 2x1 u channel ( you could also use 2x1 square extrusion but I find U easier to work with and mount things to) So thats it for now. Next is getting the right bolts and designing/printing the gear box. Oh and the profile of the balls has been tested on carpet. Has good grip and as its angled does not damage carpet.\n\nPXL_20241224_2201422841 1920×1446 219 KB\n\nPXL_20241224_2201422841 1920×1446 219 KB\n\nPXL_20241224_191115857.MP1 1920×1446 147 KB\n\nPXL_20241224_191115857.MP1 1920×1446 147 KB\n\nPXL_20241224_1936232741 1920×1446 188 KB\n\nPXL_20241224_1936232741 1920×1446 188 KB\n\nPXL_20241224_1936504781 1920×2550 277 KB\n\nPXL_20241224_1936504781 1920×2550 277 KB\n\nPXL_20241224_1938386981 1920×1446 206 KB\n\nPXL_20241224_1938386981 1920×1446 206 KB\n\nPXL_20241224_2007474721 1920×2550 489 KB\n\nPXL_20241224_2007474721 1920×2550 489 KB\n\nPXL_20241224_2035289581 1920×1446 236 KB\n\nPXL_20241224_2035289581 1920×1446 236 KB\n\nPXL_20241224_205619385.MP1 1920×2550 232 KB\n\nPXL_20241224_205619385.MP1 1920×2550 232 KB\n\nPXL_20241224_2134378661 1920×2550 324 KB\n\nPXL_20241224_2134378661 1920×2550 324 KB\n\nPXL_20241224_2134447091 1920×2550 353 KB\n\nPXL_20241224_2134447091 1920×2550 353 KB\n\nPXL_20241224_2139294151 1920×2550 306 KB\n\nPXL_20241224_2139294151 1920×2550 306 KB\n\nPXL_20241224_214306386.MP1 1920×1446 158 KB\n\nPXL_20241224_214306386.MP1 1920×1446 158 KB\n\nPXL_20241224_2154102961 1920×2550 571 KB\n\nPXL_20241224_2154102961 1920×2550 571 KB\n\nPXL_20241224_2201422841 1920×1446 219 KB\n\nPXL_20241224_2201422841 1920×1446 219 KB\n\nCost… The Semi spheres are TPU 95A geetech ($80 for 10 kg) they have cavities printed to make a solid semispher and still have some give on the outside. Each weigh about 300g so about $2.50 per semisphere. The other parts are about 400 g of PETG or ABS also about $8 per kg so $3.20 then you got the steel and bearings which I buy in bigger quantities too So I guess all in all less than $20 per wheel not counting motors and controllers. The motor can be a CIM or any motor with a CIM style mount (NEO etc) or if you roll your own mount and driver like a belt - well than anything sensible and legal.\n\nMain reasons for this project besides seeing if I can do it is that besides the real well funded teams who can spend 1000s for serfe I know “poor” teams and then this is supposed to tackle the swerve short comings with rough terrain and it should change directions faster like an xdrive while having decent to good grip.",

There were 2 CIMs to drive left/right on the balls, and 2 CIMs that drove front/back, with a chain connecting the ball to the omni.  Technically, it would still be legal today!\n\nI don’t know if this was ever shared, the original balls were actually the outdoor metal decorative balls that people have in their yards (like this ).  Then a urethane cover was poured over it to give it the grippyness.\n\nThe big problem we had with it was when the balls were put in tension (As you were pushing someone), the knurled wheels would dig into the ball and leave marks.  It seems like you have a better torque transfer system, hopefully you can do it better than we did!",

It’s a great example of taking two different (semi-obselete) drivetrain styles and how you can pick and choose pieces to make something new that can be useful again.\n\nIf that legal motor cap ever went away I’d love to see a ball system on each corner of a larger kiwi frame again. Not sure how kiwi swerve compares to this for stability. I feel like ball drive would be better and have less chance to snag on a ‘wire run’ or other bar in the field. Since the entire swerve wheel moves, the flat edge of the wheel can get wedged up against an object on the field. Where a ball will want to slip over it, even if it’s not aligned properly.",

                    "cooked": "I intend to do it with 4 balls in an X-drive configuration. It is more natural to drive straight in either the x or y axis and if you do that with a Kiwi you sometimes “loose” a wheel as it kinda stops or just coasts. With X drive you got all 4 wheelse engaged (or balls in that case) no coasting So you got the power of 4. The only time you would have coasting is if you attack exactly at a diagonal (45), That is kinda unnatural, difficult to do in teleop so very unlikely and easy to recover (spin out) off. So I picked X over KIWI Frame will be an irregular octagon basically a square with the corners flattened a bit. Should make it more difficult to pin down and again easier to spin out of plus You can make a 32x32 robot (if you want to) and still stay below the 120 in circumference rule. if you realy want to push it  you could I think even go to a full octagon with 15 in sides which should roughly give you 36 in across. IDK in which case that would make sense but you have a lot of flexibility to adapt to all kinds of situations from small to very large depending on the task at hand. I think the first prototup will have 8 inch at the corners thereabouts and whatever is still legal length and width assuming the stay with 120 in circumference. so up to 22 in length and width  giving you up to 33 in X and y. (Or less cause I always hear “robots are getting smaller”)",

If you don’t need to make the robot narrow to traverse the field (no tunnels with flaps (2016), but need it narrow to score (2023) this is a distinct advantage that you can’t get with a square/rectangular frame with full bumpers (no cut out sections in the chassis). You can pull one corner into the scoring area with a game like 2023 and have an advantage to make your arm shorter and still reach.\n\nNot always the case with a game, but it’s something to keep in mind if you want to jam a corner of the chassis into a tight spot to score. And this is an advantage for ball drive in general of being able to make an oddly shaped chassis but ultimately be able to provide locomotion and stability wherever you need it.\n\nI don’t know of a COTS swerve with adjustable angle brackets for non 90° frames",

As you only got 2 motors working to push - so 2 balls whereas on an xdrive you got all 4 pushing even though at 70 percent full power still better than the 2 on a kiwi at 80some percent. But then due to the shape/math the Kiwi could provide you with a bigger intake area.",

I got something similar in works but for now there are traction problems which could interfere with placing the robot accurately plus in his format if that was on a bot 4 wheels there be a good chance to knock it off the balls. Now I kinda got that solved but still the traction problem on a 6 in or smaller ball. And RN the ball drive is a fill in as I am full time busy with helping my peeps with reefscape things like this prototype PXL_20250120_171803343.MP1 1920×1446 246 KB As for that kinda ball drive where I am at is 20230324_1731271 1920×3409 451 KB A ball like this 20240205_2212361 1920×3409 397 KB An omni kinda like that with a planetary inside and a bevel imput to save space and rollers with teeth that interface with the above holes in the ball might at be a little jerkey at time causing position problems of the bot of +/- 2mm  in any direction plus the ball also needs a different profile section as the grip of the ball on Nyland ( FRC ) carpet IMO was below what it should be. Whereas the current design grips well enough without causing damage. Plus thos wheels have a petg inside tpu whereas the new semisphere ones are all TPU so no cracking there. 20230412_1032471 1920×3409 596 KB They are to be sandwiched in 2 frames like this - there are 4 mm bearing balls behind the 18mm bearing balls visible to prevent the robot from “loosing” its balls with the teethed omnis on top in a kiwi or xdrive configuration.

IDK if I posted it but in the meantime I added a 1in by 1/8 in strip of 304 stainless to reinforce the axle and the only thing that is a bit “hairy” is that you got to drill the holes dead on to match the print.",
