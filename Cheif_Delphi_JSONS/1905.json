Screenshot 2025-07-20 115517 861×660 38.6 KB all dimensions in mm. I know that lots of the dimensions and the part box isn’t very standard so if anyone has anything I should add or a better way to do things I’m open to suggestions. the flywheel will likely be made out of brass because it has a relatively high density and wont rust. (rust will change MOI and total weight) Screenshot 2025-07-20 010356 943×693 73.7 KB This is the motor + wheel assembly, the motor was a very simple model I made of this motor here, it has all of the holes and clearances I think are necessary. I’ve decided to cad the screws due to the weight budget and it will be good practice for my later projects. I’m going to start on the MOI math and the torques on the motor (to find current draw) to determine the batteries I will get for it, looking for around 8minutes of 100% speed run time.\n\nScreenshot 2025-07-20 115517 861×660 38.6 KB\n\nScreenshot 2025-07-20 115517 861×660 38.6 KB\n\nScreenshot 2025-07-20 010356 943×693 73.7 KB\n\nScreenshot 2025-07-20 010356 943×693 73.7 KB",

Officially under 500 grams not including airframe or wiring, the batteries will likely change as they take up 99 grams I still need weight for the wiring and airframe.\n\nQuestion for today: are there any good 4s lipos that are around the 850-1200mah range that you have used before, if not are there any lightweight wires you/ your team uses?  The final question I have, are there any specific filaments your team or you have used that you really liked for any reason? Is there any reason the mounting bracket can’t be petg or pla?\n\nedit: fixed images\n\nScreenshot 2025-07-23 192804 719×625 64.8 KB Screenshot 2025-07-23 192809 946×307 14.4 KB Screenshot 2025-07-23 192759 673×509 37.6 KB\n\nScreenshot 2025-07-23 192804 719×625 64.8 KB\n\nScreenshot 2025-07-23 192804 719×625 64.8 KB\n\nScreenshot 2025-07-23 192809 946×307 14.4 KB\n\nScreenshot 2025-07-23 192809 946×307 14.4 KB\n\nScreenshot 2025-07-23 192759 673×509 37.6 KB\n\nScreenshot 2025-07-23 192759 673×509 37.6 KB",

The one that really showed it’s worth was the herringbone gear on our wrist. It held up shockingly well and we would say it compares well to aluminum in that scenario while being lighter. It is not a cheap setup though. The roll itself is near $200 for half a spool. We used a Bambu X1E and a Creality Dryer with heat. All that is to say, the biggest downside with the CF filament is the cost in my experience.",

You probably found some info like this in your research but as a 15 year spacecraft Guidance, Nav, and Control engineer I thought i’d share a few helpful tips from my experience:\n\nMost space-based reaction wheels are configured in a tetrahedral (triangular) configuration for redundancy (can still exert momentum in any axis even if one fails or saturates)\n\nReaction control considers both secular and periodic momentum buildup to maximize time between desaturations.  In most cases a momentum bias is utilized to react to secular momentum and avoid frequent desats\n\nTo avoid the affects of viscosity and similar forces  in the reaction wheel assembly (particularly for wheels enclosed with lubricants), desats usually dont spin-down the wheel to zero.  Usually they are spun down to either a negative value (increasing momentum capacity) or slightly above zero\n\nBalance in the wheel is so incredibly important.  Any non-uniform wear or fabrication (like something you’d get from 3D printing) causes vibration and this can be a killer for satellites and aircraft.  Even perfectly balanced wheels usually need some sort of shock absorption for the frame\n\nApply sensible rate limits to the reaction wheels if using it for attitude control.  At least in spacecraft, when pointing the satellite you will get your wheel’s momentum capacity back when nulling rates after a slew, but only if you didn’t saturate\n\nIf you want to expand beyond reaction wheel system, take a look at Control Moment Gyros, which can apply much larger torques thanks to the gyro’s angular momentum.  This is used on larger, heavier satellites where higher rate limits are needed.",

My wheel will just sit horizontally and control the roll axis of a small model rocket but may look into some kind of small dampening system (how truck cabs attach to frame with rubber pads or something similar) it would just be a little more work and because I’m only leaving around 4-8 millimeters between the outside of the wheel and the airframe it could be difficult but very interesting.\n\nI’ve looking into building a tetrahedral style system just for fun, but want to get this first one done before that. Just because you might know, what kind of test stands would people use to hold the frame (cube sat style frame) when testing on earth lol would it be like a fft gyro style stand or something else.",

I might end up putting in an off the shelf LCD voltage monitor in it so I can have that handy at some point. if there are any files people would like to have for this project, I’m open to sharing them, they might not be standard of any kind because it is my first time using kicad well, I’ve tried before but not great.\n\nif anyone has any resources for designing voltage step down circuits (or knows anything about them in general) it would be wonderful if you could share those. I’m thinking about using kobalt 24V 4A power tool batteries to run it, I already have a few and I figure it would be easier to half the voltage and double amp then to deal with dewalt and have to 2/3 the voltage and such.\n\nIMO wanting to use kobalt batteries but need to half the voltage.",

If I step down the voltage to twelve volts does it double the amps? I’m finding out a lot online but can’t seem to make any sense of it. Any guidance here would be great. It would be a closed loop system I think because it’s not plugged into anything other than what’s in the robot. Are there any good resources on learning custom electronics like this or just general electrical engineering/pcb design.",
