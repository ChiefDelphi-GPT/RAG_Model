I want to create a thread for all the tips and troubleshooting guides on the CAN Bus. Your contributions are more than appreciated. Any suggestions and corrections can be posted below, and I will add them later.\n\n(edit: ChatGPT grammar fix)\n\nSource: https://store.ctr-electronics.com/products/canivore 1280×1208 162 KB\n\nSource: https://store.ctr-electronics.com/products/canivore 1280×1208 162 KB\n\nSource: https://store.ctr-electronics.com/products/canivore 1280×1208 162 KB\n\nroboRIO CAN Bus (the one where Talon SRX controllers are connected) - Built-in port on the roboRIO. Pretty much all FRC -legal CAN devices can be connected to this bus.\n\nCANivore CAN Bus (the one where Falcon motors are connected) - USB extended from CANivore . Only CTRE CAN FD devices can be connected to this bus.\n\nThese two CAN Buses CANNOT be interconnected. They must be isolated from each other. This means CANivore cannot exist on the roboRIO CAN Bus and vice versa.\n\nA CAN Bus connection should be made using at least 22 AWG (0.5 mm²) twisted pair cable, color-coded in Yellow/Green. This is because CAN Bus is a differential signal, and twisted pair cable ensures that electromagnetic interference affects the signal in both wires uniformly, limiting errors.

In this topology, one device will connect after each other in a daisy chain. At both end of the chain, a termination is needed. This is the most recommended way when it comes to topology.\n\nSometimes on rare occasion a star (branched) Bus might be necessary. However, this is not really the recommended way to do CAN Bus. In the past with CAN 2.0, teams with very short CAN buses may have been able to get some degree of success without ensuring the above requirements are met, such as with star or ring topologies. However, as transmission frequencies increase (such as in CAN FD), it is more important to ensure proper bus topology (daisy chain or short stub lengths). ( Source & @andej ) please avoid this kind of network at all cost unless you have no option (for example, a mechanism was slippering that cannot accommodate 4 conductor for CAN Bus).\n\nWhen making a star Bus, make sure to insulate the unconnected leads. If using Krakens with bolted connections, you can make cables with only one lead. ( Source @Mike_Schreiber ) You don’t need to terminate every single device in a star Bus stop (except for the last one at a distinct end).\n\nThe CAN Bus is bidirectional, and both ends of the cable must be terminated. However, only the two nodes at the far ends of the cable, not every node on the bus, require termination resistors.  ( Source ) Termination is done using a 120 Ohm resistor at both distinct ends of the CAN Bus. Not doing so could cause CAN Bus instability or complete failure. ( Source )\n\nThe roboRIO has a built-in termination resistor. As the roboRIO is always the first device in this CAN Bus, nothing is needed at this end.\n\nThe roboRIO has a built-in termination resistor. As the roboRIO is always the first device in this CAN Bus, nothing is needed at this end.\n\nAll power distribution devices ( PDP / PDH ) have a jumper that enables the termination resistor. If these devices are used as termination, they should be placed as the last device on the Bus. It is strongly recommended that you connect your power distribution device onto the CAN Bus for current logging if your device supports it (all PD devices except CTRE PDP 2.0 have this feature). Even though this is no longer required in 2025, current logging makes troubleshooting for brownouts much easier.\n\nAll power distribution devices ( PDP / PDH ) have a jumper that enables the termination resistor.

Refer to the manufacturer’s recommendation when using these devices to ensure the proper termination of your CAN Bus.\n\nA 120 Ohm resistor can be manually added at the end of the CAN Bus.\n\nThe CANivore has a 120 Ohm programmable resistor for terminating the CAN Bus. The resistor can be configured using the CAN Bus Termination toggle in the CANivore device card in Phoenix Tuner X . ( Source ) You need to open Phoenix Tuner X and manually enable this option.\n\nSource: https://v6.docs.ctr-electronics.com/en/2024/docs/canivore/canivore-config.html 1054×767 26.6 KB\n\nSource: https://v6.docs.ctr-electronics.com/en/2024/docs/canivore/canivore-config.html 1054×767 26.6 KB\n\nSource: https://v6.docs.ctr-electronics.com/en/2024/docs/canivore/canivore-config.html 1054×767 26.6 KB\n\nA 120 Ohm resistor must be manually added at the end of the CAN Bus. All power distribution devices do not support CAN FD , which means they can only be connected to the roboRIO CAN Bus. Unless you have a third-party device that supports CAN FD termination, you will need to add this resistor manually.\n\nCertain third-party devices, such as Swyft Cannect , have built-in termination resistors. Refer to the manufacturer’s recommendation when using these devices to ensure proper termination of your CAN Bus.\n\nDue to the complexity of CAN devices, most peripherals require third-party libraries in your code to function properly. Each device from a different vendor will have a unique set of APIs. Always refer to the latest documentation from each vendor.\n\nA number of FRC ® vendors offer their own CAN peripherals. As CAN devices offer expansive feature-sets, vendor CAN devices require similarly expansive code libraries to operate. As a result, these ...\n\nEach vendor provides configuration software for their CAN devices. Here are some major ones:\n\nCTRE : Phoenix Tuner X\n\nREV Robotics: REV Hardware Client\n\nRedux Robotics: Alchemist\n\nGrapple Robotics: GrappleHook\n\nThe Thrifty Bot: Thrifty Config Software\n\nIf you use a CAN device from a vendor, you must install the appropriate configuration software on your computer to set the ID and update the firmware for your CAN device. Firmware and software across different companies are not interchangeable. The firmware version must match the library in your robot code. A mismatch could cause degraded performance, high bus utilization, and software bugs.\n\nEach CAN device needs a unique ID. If two devices from the same manufacturer on the same bus have the same ID, both devices will not function correctly. Usually, two devices from different manufacturers can have the same ID; however, it is strongly not recommended to do this to avoid confusion. A device will have an ID of 0 if it is new, has its firmware updated, or has been factory reset. You must change the ID from 0, or your device won’t work properly. Please refer to the documentation from your device manufacturer on how to set the ID, as each device is slightly different.\n\nThese are some of the most common issues when it comes to CAN Bus failures.\n\nTo troubleshoot these kinds of issues, a digital multimeter can be used to test continuity between wires. When doing so, make sure the battery is disconnected. Test continuity between both CAN Bus wires, between each CAN Bus wire and multiple points on the robot frame, and between each CAN Bus wire and battery positive/ground. There should not be any continuity.\n\nWires that are shorted together, touching the robot frame, or other non- CAN Bus wires.\n\nLoose connectors, crimps, etc.\n\nUse a digital multimeter to measure resistance between CAN Bus wires. When doing so, make sure the battery is disconnected. If the resistance is near 60-120 Ohms, your termination should be good. If the measurement turns out to be several kiloohms, you need to check your termination.\n\nMissing termination resistor (very common for CANivore CAN Bus).\n\nJumper in the wrong position.\n\nSwitch in the wrong position.\n\nDamaged wire or solder point to the termination resistor.\n\nDisconnected device.\n\nSometimes a broken device could send rogue packets onto the Bus. This can also be caused by old or corrupted firmware. When this happens, it is critical to isolate the device causing the issue. You might need to disconnect CAN devices from the Bus one by one until the problem disappears. Then, reconnect only that device back to the roboRIO or CANivore and see if the problem reappears.\n\nOnly certain devices supporting CAN FD from CTRE should be connected with CANivore. The CANivore Bus should not be connected with the roboRIO Bus.\n\nToo many devices on the same Bus can cause issues. Ideally, an average of less than 80% utilization is desired. You can check Bus utilization on Driver Station and Phoenix Tuner X . Sometimes, a firmware update could reduce utilization. However, if you simply have too many devices, you might consider moving some devices to another bus. Currently, only CTRE supports this with CANivore , and only CTRE CAN FD devices can be connected to this bus.\n\nThere could be multiple reasons behind these kinds of problems, and they are often the most frustrating to troubleshoot. Sometimes, it is the vendor’s library causing the issue, while other times, it could be your code pulling data from the device too frequently. This might be one of those moments when you need to contact manufacturer support, make a post on Chief Delphi, and spend a lot of time debugging. However, it is critical to isolate the issue from the other types of failures. Consider loading a basic code where you have all your CAN devices initialized but performing no actions to confirm that it is not a communication problem.",
