                    "cooked": "Hi all,\n\nMy team is using mk4i swerve modules with NEOs for driving and steering. I explicitly set the rotation and sideways transition values to 0 in the drive method of my code to make sure I was only commanding the swerve modules to go either straight or back for debugging purposes. When I try going forward, the robot drifts and rotates a noticeable amount, and when going back and forth a bunch of times, the robot almost turns 60 degrees.\n\nVideo showing gyro plot: https://youtu.be/vZIdrbKYHIM\n\nVideo showing robot movement: https://youtu.be/cVLMU1bkP-0\n\nCode: https://github.com/team2059/Max-Quordlepleen/blob/master/src/main/java/frc/robot/subsystems/SwerveModule.java\n\nI don’t think it has anything to do with Gyro drift because we are using a NavX 2, and it only drifts a degree/per minute, which is not nearly enough to cause the behavior shown in the videos I’ve linked above. I suspect it has something to do with the steer motors because they seem to be turning ever so slightly, and over time, it seems to be making the robot turn more and more, even though the steer motors shouldn’t even be active if the robot is only translating in the forward/backward direction. Maybe I’m missing something here, but any suggestions/feedback is greatly appreciated!",

I know this doesn’t really have anything to do with drift, but at least what I’m seeing on my computer matches what I’m seeing IRL. Still learning the ropes of AdvantageScope.\n\nIf I rotate CCW on my joystick, AdvantageScope shows the robot rotating CCW as well, and the robot moves CCW IRL. It’s the same thing for CW. Telemetry data is now good in AdvantageScope and matches my robot’s behavior. I still need to figure out the drift.",

If this is causing the drift, why? Why would this cause the steering motors to actuate very subtly, even when I tell it to go straight? If this isn’t causing the drift, what could it be? Also, how would I mitigate this overshooting anyways, if it matters at all?",
