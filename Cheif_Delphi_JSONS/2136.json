                    "cooked": "Hi everyone,\n\nOur team recently acquired a Duralast 12V 100A crank tester, and I had a few questions about how others are using this type of tool in the context of FRC .\n\nI have read a few threads discussing load testing, but I am curious how often teams actually use this kind of tester as a quick diagnostic tool. My goal is to use it primarily for a quick **PASS/FAIL ** check to identify obviously bad batteries more quickly than with a full CBA test.\n\nI understand that automotive batteries and FRC batteries have different characteristics and use cases, but I’d love to hear how others approach using a cranker like this. Specifically:\n\nHow long do you apply the load during testing?\n\nAre there any key voltage thresholds you look for?\n\nDo you use it regularly as part of your battery maintenance workflow?\n\nAny tips or best practices would be appreciated. Thanks!",

Starting batteries are good at emitting high current over a short time, generally used for starting motors. Deep cycle batteries are good at cycling up and down and supplying a sustained power for a longer time. Dual purpose just combine the two.\n\nFRC batteries are dual purpose. They’re good at cycling, but can also be used to start small motors. You’ll see them commonly in generators. Motorcycles generally use starting batteries.\n\nNow as for testing batteries. You can use a CCA tester to get a generalized test of battery capacity, but it would be better to do a full discharge test. The battery is charged and discharged three times to find an overall measure of capacity. If you want to do this, take it to a batteries Plus. I can’t speak for all, but the one I worked at would test batteries for free.\n\nTLDR: CCA will give you a rough estimate of battery capacity, but take it somewhere to be professionally tested for a more accurate result.",

Testing using yours with some known good batteries will give you the stats you can apply for your tests.  I don’t consider these to be traceable to any NIST standards in terms of the accuracy of the load applied or the displayed voltage on the analog dial but that’s not what I’m looking for anyway.\n\nYou’re applying 100A load so I’d adjust the time and voltage expectations but some testing will get you in the ballpark.  100A is up there so you don’t want to go too long.\n\nWrite the instructions on the case someplace so people can do this in similar ways and Bob’s yer uncle for a quick pass/fail test.",

The test takes literally 10 seconds\n\nWe dig it out when we have a mysterious brownout match and suspect the battery.  Tag the battery “bad/weird/dunno”, charge it back up and test.  If it passes the 100 Amp tester you need to dig further into what caused your brownout…  Fail the test, well, I bet you know what to do\n\nThere’s a pretty good chance that a bad-cell battery will have a similar “fail” behavior partially charged.  BUT, I haven’t tried it.  Maybe next time we get a failed cell I will remember…  We had a rash of failed cell batteries in the Covid era.  Whee.  I think it was 4 or 5 of them.  Honestly, at the time, it was MOST of the new batteries.\n\nHere’s my latest version, with integrated Anderson and all the excess junk removed.",

Verify on some fresh and old batteries.\n\nWe run it before the battery goes on the robot.  One less way to get surprised during a match.",

A few seconds at 100A is well within the operating environment of a battery on FRC duty.  If it can’t take this, it’s gonna be miserable on the field.",
