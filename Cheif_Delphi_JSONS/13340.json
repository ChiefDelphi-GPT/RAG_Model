The electrical lead gives preliminary electrical input in early august and raises concerns regarding the indexing motor passing the belly pan perimeter. Concerns are also raised about the placement of the circuit breaker.\n\nElectrical team wire control system. They experience issues with wiring power into the Power Distribution Panel due to lack of space and its proximity to the Back Left Swerve Module. Other issues experienced include loose mounting wires caused by a lack of a patterned belly pan. Indexing motor concerns are also brought up.\n\nCircuit breaker is mounted to the Delrin compression panels.\n\nThe electrical system experienced zero failures. The electrical pit crew conducts electrical systems check on the morning of 10/9 and does not see any issues.\n\nThe electrical team conduct an electrical systems check during climb wiring do not see any issues with the battery ground wire.\n\nProgramming and Drive Teams test and practice with the robot.

Power and Ground wires from the battery route into the PDH. The power wire is spliced by the Circuit Breaker while the ground wire is directly routed into the PDH. During battery replacement, both wires are tensioned. The power wire is mounted on the circuit breaker rendering it immune to said tension. However, the ground wire places direct tension onto the PDH port. Previous generation distribution panels (CTRE PDP) use a nut and washer assembly to mount the ground wire which is far more resilient to external forces. The PDH, in contrast, used WAGO connectors which function based on metallic cage clamps exerting force onto the wires. This system does not have a bolt preventing unsanctioned removal. Over multiple battery replacements, the ground wire can be slipped out of the port.\n\nThis was the most likely cause. The lack of thorough electrical inspections did not help in any regard. It is likely the case that the robot entered Block Party with loose wires.\n\nAdditionally, after the practice match, or quals 1, the battery replacement may have been aggressive causing the wires to further shift out of the WAGO connectors.\n\nBy match 8, the robot was experiencing issues with the breaker tripping. The likely cause was a minor short circuit between the power and ground wires. It was small enough to be undetectable but large enough to cause the breaker to trip.\n\nBreakers are designed so that the threshold for tripping lowers each time it trips. For this reason, breakers tripped in subsequent matches.\n\nThe pit crew replaced the breaker before match 19 but did not inspect the PDH directly after. The power wire may have slipped out further in the instance. In match 19, the robot was heavily defended by 4911. During this, 4911 slipped under the robot and caused the ground wire to shift more causing a large short circuit. This melted through other power wires causing a fire.\n\nAfter this match, Pit Crew replaced the wiring but failed to inspect the PDH due to time constraints and the fact that the PDH was buried under wires. The Pit Crew failed to notice molten residue left inside the port and instead mounted the wires back into the WAGO port. This meant that the ground wire did not have a proper connection to the PDH and was not mounted. over the next two matches, the robot experience power loss as the wire shifted from contact.\n\nIn match 27, the wire likely caused a short circuit that melted through the plastic casing on the WAGO connections.\n\nWhile some electrical considerations were taken (placement of electrical components, and batteries), the wiring was not thoroughly planned out\n\nWhile some electrical considerations were taken (placement of electrical components, and batteries), the wiring was not thoroughly planned out\n\nComponents on the electrical board were not placed until the design had been finalized.\n\nComponents on the electrical board were not placed until the design had been finalized.\n\nThe electrical subteam was not kept in the loop during the design process (members were absent).\n\nThe electrical subteam was not kept in the loop during the design process (members were absent).\n\nBellypan and electrical board were made of flex poly making damage to the electrical system during heavy defense easy.\n\nBellypan and electrical board were made of flex poly making damage to the electrical system during heavy defense easy.\n\nBellypan was smoked poly so it had to be removed for every inspection leading to hesitation/time delay for full systems check.\n\nBellypan was smoked poly so it had to be removed for every inspection leading to hesitation/time delay for full systems check.\n\nDuring battery mounting, stress is placed on the connections to the PDH.\n\nDuring battery mounting, stress is placed on the connections to the PDH.\n\nElectrical fixes were not necessarily prioritized in pits.\n\nElectrical fixes were not necessarily prioritized in pits.\n\nWiring was not planned well (in conjunction with design).\n\nWiring was not planned well (in conjunction with design).\n\nNot all electrical cables were tensioned.\n\nNot all electrical cables were tensioned.\n\nPower and Ground wiring were not expected to slip — no effort was made to tension them.\n\nPower and Ground wiring were not expected to slip — no effort was made to tension them.\n\nLack of cohesive systems check.\n\nLack of cohesive systems check.\n\nLack of frequent systems checks.\n\nLack of frequent systems checks.\n\nPDH breaker and CAN layout not recorded or updated.\n\nPDH breaker and CAN layout not recorded or updated.\n\nWire- protection was not used as extensively as needed.\n\nWire- protection was not used as extensively as needed.\n\nHot glue for mounting was not used extensively.\n\nHot glue for mounting was not used extensively.\n\nElectrical was given minimal time during robot wiring.\n\nElectrical was given minimal time during robot wiring.\n\nThe electrical subteam has only 3 official members.\n\nThe electrical subteam has only 3 official members.\n\nNo cohesive drive or testing logs led to a lack of contextual data.\n\nNo cohesive drive or testing logs led to a lack of contextual data.\n\nBattery mounting\n\nBattery mounting\n\nElectrical was not necessarily prioritized in the budget leading to a lack of spares.\n\nComponents need to be placed on the CAD.\n\nComponents need to be placed on the CAD.\n\nThe wiring needs to be taken into consideration.\n\nThe wiring needs to be taken into consideration.\n\nThe electrical board needs to be machined\n\nThe electrical board needs to be machined\n\nThe electrical system needs to be better protected (Rigid Poly or integrated electrical)\n\nThe electrical system needs to be better protected (Rigid Poly or integrated electrical)\n\nif a belly pan is used, it needs to be transparent.\n\nif a belly pan is used, it needs to be transparent.\n\nPrebuilt electrical board and drivetrain\n\nPrebuilt electrical board and drivetrain\n\nBattery:\n\nEnsure easy wiring from the battery to PDH while also routing to the breaker.

Further failure was caused by the lack of time, organization, and extensive inspection procedures in the pit leading to greater damage in the PDH.\n\nIt also concludes that the indirect cause of PDH failure is poor electrical considerations in design, improper battery mounting procedures, and lack of extensive inspection procedures.\n\nThis report details recommended optimizations to multiple processes to prevent both the direct and indirect causes of PDH failure.\n\nFollow the 7461 build thread for more updates!",
