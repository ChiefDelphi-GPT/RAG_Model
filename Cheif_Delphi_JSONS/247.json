If I want to know the specifics of what a command does, I have to go into that class. A single incorrect ifFinished() method leads to commands continuously running. It’s harder to make different subsystems to work together. Creating new robot behaviors is really difficult.  \n\nDisclaimer: I am in no way the first to have this idea. This is only my implementation of a state machine, and my framework that I am presenting.  \n\nThis might not be for you  \nWhen designing our team’s state machine, I did it to help myself. This framework may not be the best solution for everyone. I highly recommend adapting it to fit your specific needs as a team.  \n\nWhat my state machine does well  \n- The framework is incredibly stable, making it very difficult to have any unknown errors in your code.  \n- The adaptability allows adding new robot functions quickly, easily, and isolated from creating bugs in other areas of the code.  \n- Heavily reduces the time from zero to autonomous when debugging code.  \n- Creates more understandable control flow of the robot  \n\nThe proof is in the pudding  \n- Switched a coral mechanism for a de-algae mechanism with almost no software issues  \n- Code did not crash/break in a single match this year!!!  \n- Was able to bind our entire controls to 3 buttons (which meant controlling our robot was silky smooth)  \n- I made the next programmer after me (a sophomore at the time) make his own code base (using a state machine) for our robot. He got the code he was working on running fully in four hours with the robot without my or anyone’s help!!!  \n\nWhat do you think? (Please be kind!)  \nWhat are your opinions on this idea? How can it be improved? What would you change? We, the FIRST Robotics Competition programming community, have an opportunity to create some real change with the RoboRio replacement coming soon. I hope that some version of a state machine becomes the next default paradigm, but that would only come with community support. Also, please be kind, use constructive criticism and be mindful of what you say.",

                    "cooked": "This is neat. I know 2910 uses FSMs instead of commands, and it’s interesting to consider other ways of thinking. Unfortunately, I’m a command-based fanboy, so it’ll take a lot for me to switch, but this is very informational, very well thought-out, and overall a good take on a different way to approach control.\n\nAn entire robot in 4 hours is bizarre, but in a good way.\n\nI’ve got a couple questions/comments, though:\n1. The handler is supposed to read input from sensors\n2. The handler is supposed to make writes to the hardware through the subsystem class\n3. Each handler is responsible for the state logic of the subsystem and no other subsystem.\n\nIf the manager is connected to just one subsystem, and it reads from that subsystem, and it writes to that subsystem—and it’s responsible for solely the behavior of that subsystem—why is it its own thing and not implemented as part of the subsystem itself?\n\nAlso, is it fair to say that this style of programming doesn’t do encapsulation well? Everything in your codebase is a singleton, with mutable global state that can be accessed anywhere. There’s nothing wrong with that right now, but that opens up the opportunity for other parts of your code to access and make writes to hardware that really shouldn’t be accessible publicly. How do you handle this besides telling people “don’t do that”?\n\nThe singleton design pattern doesn’t seem (to me) to be a critical part of your FSM structure; I would chop this out. Instead, I would merge the handlers and the subsystems, and then just have each as a regular instance in the code. This would force programmers to only be able to use the class where they should be using it-i.e. binding things to triggers, and make sure that subsystems’ access is as limited as possible.\n\nReally, I’d even go further and create a mix of a command-based paradigm and a FSM. Instead of creating commands in RobotContainer, I’d move the creation of commands to the subsystem classes themselves, as well (but that could be too much CB). Currently, there’s this line in RobotContainer (formatted for CD readability):\n\nOI.driverController.start().onTrue(new InstantCommand(\n  () -> S_Swerve.getInstance().setHeading(0),\n  Swerve.getInstance()));\n\nIf you put the command creation in the subsystem, you could make it look like this:\n\nOI.driverController.start().onTrue(swerve.setHeading(0));\n\n(<code>swerve</code> not <code>Swerve.getInstance()</code> because I don’t love the singletons)\n\nIf setHeading() is a public method that returns the instant command to do the thing. But again, this may be too much focus on commands—even though it doesn’t actually replace any state logic, but only moves it. I prefer to separate bindings from the actions they do, but that could just be me.",

                    "cooked": "You make some valid points. I recommend taking a look at our competition codebase. I think it’ll make things seem a little more sane. You’ll see there that I have hidden away making new commands so the programmer doesn’t have to do it over and over. Also, the manager is connected to EVERY handler (except your drive train) and is responsible for all of them. Each handler is only responsible for ONE subsystem. I had in a previous iteration the handlers combined with the subsystems, but the functionality is different enough I found I was only looking at one of the two at a time. As a result, I separated them for better readability and making the debugging process a bit easier. As for encapsulation, I believe the best solution is to make the handlers a subclass to the subsystems and keep the subsystems private. Then only the handlers can modify the subsystem it extends. I graduated before implementing it and I think it’s good enough at this point. The singleton design pattern isn’t critical, that’s true. However, I found it’s just nice to have and I like using it so I decided to include it. It’s more personal preference, although it does help ensure only one subsystem has only one handler. Thank you for your insights, I hope this answers your questions!",

Instead, you (and everyone else) should be using the command factory methods: startEnd, run, until, etc. It’s harder to make different subsystems to work together. Difficulty varies based on what you’re trying to do, but it is in no means hard to coordinate two subsystems with command-based architecture at the simplest level, such as running two motors at the same time. Creating new robot behaviors is really difficult. This is very vague, and likely points to inefficient organization of subsystem architecture rather than a flaw with command-based setups. New behavior is as simple as making a new command that does something different, unless I'm misunderstanding. It seems about as complex in either an FSM or command-based setup.",
