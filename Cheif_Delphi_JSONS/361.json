A couple years ago I created a Shuffleboard like application built using the FWC component library . Since then some great new dashboard alternatives such as Elastic have been released which fill the needs of most teams. However, if you’re interested in creating custom dashboards and enjoy using web technologies I encourage you to try this project out!\n\nThe app can be installed from here: Release FWC Dashboard 2025.1.3 · frc-web-components/app · GitHub\n\nA web hosted version of the dashboard is also available if you’d like to try it.  You can even connect to your simulated robot right from your browser: FWC Dashboard\n\nDashboard documentation can be found here: frc-web-components/docs/dashboard.md at master · frc-web-components/frc-web-components\n\nPlugin documentation can be found here: frc-web-components/docs/plugins.md at master · frc-web-components/frc-web-components\n\nThis year the dashboard app has been completely refactored and now uses React for rendering and Redux for state management. The project previously relied on a lot of custom stuff as well as some lesser known libraries such as Lit . I found this to be a turn off for would-be developers looking to contribute. I decided to switch to a software stack that was more familiar and approachable. This was a lot of work and contributed to the late release, but I’m hoping long term the switch will make it easier for myself and others to continue supporting the project. There’s still work left to be done on documentation and probably a few bugs that will need to fixed, but I wanted to make a post about this before it becomes too late in the season.\n\nAside from refactors, other significant updates have been made this year, particularly to the user interface:\n\nA new layout manager was added powered by React FlexLayout . Tabs can now be rearranged into rows, columns, and tab groups:\n\nThis is a frequently requested feature from other dashboards such as Elastic and Shuffleboard:\n\nComponents can now be arranged in a grid:\n\nComponents can be changed to other components that accept the same type of source that it’s current assigned. This can be done by right clicking a selected component and selecting from the Show As… menu:\n\nimage 1197×500 38.8 KB\n\nimage 1197×500 38.8 KB\n\nimage 1197×500 38.8 KB\n\nA lot of the improvements here were pulled from AdvantageScope so a huge thank you to AdvantageScope and its team of developers!\n\nNT4 client has been upgraded to 4.1\n\nAdded support for structs\n\nThe dashboard subscribes to all topics only while editing. While competing only the topics used by your components will be subscribed to.\n\nThe dashboard now includes built-in layouts which can be opened from the File > Open Example… menu. Currently only a YAGSL Swerve layout is available, but more will be added soon:\n\nComponent behavior can be modified through their properties. Properties can be edited from the “Properties” panel:\n\nProperties can be externally controlled by binding them to sources. In previous versions you could only bind a source directly to the component. In the 2025 release you can now also bind sources directly to individual properties:\n\nIn the image above the NetworkTables “/box” source has 2 children: /box/value and /box/Label . The children are mapped to properties in the component (the keys are converted to camel case, so an exact match is not required). Another source is bound directly to the “trueColor” property.\n\nThe plugin API is now simpler and more consistent between different front-end frameworks. Plugins can be created using React, Svelte, Lit, and any front-end framework that supports web components.\n\nHere’s an example of a simple component created using the plugin API with React and Svelte:\n\nThe component will be typed based on the properties you provide the component:\n\nimage 1207×342 21.7 KB\n\nimage 1207×342 21.7 KB\n\nimage 1207×342 21.7 KB\n\nPlugins can be built and imported into your dashboard. Once imported plugin components will be available to add:\n\n(Using an image here because the text is preventing me from creating the topic for some reason)\n\nimage 625×640 25.1 KB\n\nimage 625×640 25.1 KB\n\nimage 625×640 25.1 KB\n\nIf you have any questions, suggestions or find any bugs feel free to post here or create an issue in the github repo: Issues · frc-web-components/frc-web-components",

These assets are static so they would only need to be downloaded when the robot first connects, and as long as your browser can cache the files this should only happen once. I think for this to work you’d need a stripped-down version of the dashboard for display purposes only (no editing capabilities) to reduce its size and the ability to export a layout from the app as a file that can be dropped into the deploy folder and served directly from there.",

Are you by chance seeing an error that looks like this?\n\nThere’s a process for signing and notarizing a macOS app that I haven’t gone through, so if you’re seeing this issue then it’s likely its being blocked. I had to get around this issue with the following command:\n\nAre you running a mac with one of the newer apple silicon chips, or one of the older intel ones? I’ve only tested with my M2 macbook pro so there might be issues I’m not aware of on different models.\n\nAs far as developing in that repo you were on the right track, but unfortunately the documentation is very confusing and out of date. I’ll spend some time updating the docs and address the concerns you posted in the issue and this thread here.\n\nTo run the app you’ll have to first run pnpm dev as you’ve already done. This builds the other packages the dashboard relies on and watches for changes. Once that is done in a separate terminal you’ll have to run pnpm dashboard:dev which launches the dashboard in the browser using vite.\n\nHowever, what you probably want is run in the tauri app: frc-web-components/app: Tauri app for FRC Web Components dashboard\n\nThis requires rust as well as npm. Once cloned you’ll have to run npm install and then npm run tauri:dev to launch the app. I’ll also add developer documentation to this repo as well.",

I was looking through all your documentation about FRC WEB Components, because I’m working on a robot project that needs a front-end with a dynamic and complete interface. I’m using Studica Robotics Hardware, which in general all the programming is the same as FRC , but it only supports VScode and WPILIB version 2020. My current problem is that I can’t pull the encoder values ​​to run on my front-end. Do you have an example just to pull the value?",

The dashboard app uses a newer version of NetworkTables (4.1) and is incompatible with older versions of WPILib which uses NetworkTables version 3. The dashboard can communicate directly with an NT4 server since it uses websockets, while back in the NT3 days additional tools like pynetworktables2js needed to be used as well. If you’d like I can assist with creating a plugin that allows the dashboard to communicate with an NT3 server using pynetworktables2js. Alternatively, I can help get you started with a React, Svelte or some other web based template that uses the component library and pynetworktables2js?",

In my WEB interface, I set up the Operator’s camera by creating a simple action stream using USB port 1181 along with the robot’s IP address. I also added a JS function to capture the image and achieve my goal of displaying the date and the encoder value—which, in the robot’s programming, is already calculated in millimeters. However, I am really lost on how to retrieve the encoder value. I looked into pynetworktables2js, ran it in my WEB project, and also implemented the FRCWebComponents script that you shared!
