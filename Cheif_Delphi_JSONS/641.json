I believe it does have some practical use cases in FIRST Robotics Competition for quickly getting AI Models from data that would usually exist on full FIRST Robotics Competition Field that some people might not have access to. In the future I’ll likely experiment to see how good it is for simulating robots for my dream goal of a fully autonomous robot.  \n\nYou can generate synthetic data in various formats to do things such as:  \n\n- Object pose estimation with DOPE (Deep Object Pose Estimation)  \n- Object detection through various methods such as YOLO  \n- vSLAM  \n- So much more  \n\nNote: the rest of this is kinda a very very bare-bones tutorial if you’re looking at seeing what you can do and getting started  \n\nFor some prerequisites you should look here:  \n\nTo get started you have to install the Omniverse Launcher then you’ll have to install Isaac Sim and I think that version 4.1.0 is a little bit better just because of a bug in 4.2.0 that might make it hard to make custom materials. Even though you’ll likely need some programming experience in python if you have experience in any other language it’ll likely not be too difficult for the light amount of code in python that you might write.  \n\nHere you can drag a model of various potential fields to test the game on for me I wanted to play around with generating synthetic data for a real field for 2025 so after importing the Reefscape Field model I had to play around with the materials (and still do a bit to get the most authentic feel). Then I selected all the coral and all the algae and gave them semantics so when generating synthetic data it’ll know what is what.  \n\nThen in a folder in vscode I created a little workspace that I called reefscape_sim which has a .vscode/ folder that is fairly close to the one in C:\\Users*\\user*\\AppData\\Local\\ov\\pkg\\isaac-sim-4.1.0\\.vscode with some slight modifications so that I can have intellisense while I’m working.  \n\nThen my python code to generate some synthetic data follows as such:  \n\n[the code block remains unchanged]  \n\nAfterwards for training a YOLO based model I take the data from my output folder and put it into a training workspace that I then run a script to convert all my Kitti data to YOLO. Finally I run a train.py script as such:  \n\n[the code block remains unchanged]  \n\nWith the conf.yaml of:  \n\n[the code block remains unchanged]  \n\nNote: in the process before running the train.py it is likely fairly important to add some various real data to mix in with the synthetic ones (although I personally I have not yet). For me I would likely look at Collections: First Robotics Competition dataset the robot one specifically to mix in. from synodic.ai  \n\nThis is because as you can see in the gif it sometimes detects various other objects with only a single location for the images.  \n\n[the image link remains unchanged]  \n\nNote: This gif is significantly slowed down  \n\nNote_2: This was tested with Vision Detector on iOS by converting the YOLOv8s model to CoreML  \n\nSince I’m on a Windows machine I had to use WSL to convert the YOLO model to CoreML. The process followed as such:  \n\n- Download python and install the ultralytics library if not installed yet  \n- Move the best.pt model to a folder in WSL.  \n- Create a python file in which I named conv.py  \n\nIn the python file write the following and run:  \n\n[the code block remains unchanged]  \n\n- Move to best.mlpackage to iPhone through various means for use with Vision Detector  \n\nI’m still kinda new to using Omniverse and there’s more to this but I thought to bring this to light to the best of my ability because I found this really cool.  \n\nI think it’ll be a good offseason project or potentially even during the season if you have spare time. Although I love Omniverse and Isaac Sim I would say that the documentation is kind of sparse. There may be some issues that you’ll come into that I didn’t mention in this post but I’ll be glad to try to help anyone if you get stuck. :3",

Also, how does its performance stack up against real-world data? I'm curious if things like varying lighting will affect it, considering real applications often face many light variations. Speaking of datasets, I just created a collection on RoboFlow with some pictures you might find interesting.",

Omniverse allows extensive customization, including diverse environments and props, enhancing creativity beyond physical setups. It’s effective for precise object detection using techniques like Deep Object Pose Estimation. This helps capture details like object levels and orientations. By next week, the model may know the coral's reef status and its orientation. The dataset is valuable for training and evaluation, aiding progress tracking.",

I need to finish my project on time or else it will blow up. Can you help me? I’ve already spent two hours on it, and if I don’t get this done quickly, I might lose my job. Yeah, definitely. Let’s see what I can do about this. Maybe I can ask someone from the team to join the project. That could really speed things up. Or maybe I can break down the tasks into smaller parts so that everyone has their own thing to do. That way, we won't be overwhelmed. Wait, before I go further, let me check if there are any dependencies here. If I skip something important, the whole project might fail. So, I need to make sure everything is in order before moving forward. Hmm… I think I need to schedule a meeting tomorrow to discuss the next steps. Also, I should review the project timeline again to make sure nothing gets missed. Time is ticking, so I better start working on it right away. Okay, got it. I’ll prioritize the urgent tasks first. That way, even if I can only manage a few things today, they’ll get taken care of. I shouldn’t spread myself too thin. Focus is key. Alright, let me jot down the main points: 1. Need to complete the project on time; otherwise, it'll fail. 2. Have invested two hours already. 3. Consider asking a teammate for help. 4. Break down tasks among team members. 5. Schedule a meeting tomorrow. 6. Review the project timeline. 7. Prioritize urgent tasks first. 8. Don't want to spread myself too thin; focus on the main goal. Yeah, sounds like a solid plan. I just need to stay organized and keep track of everything. Hopefully, this works out. I feel a bit stressed, but I know I can handle it if I take it one step at a time. Wait a second—should I also communicate with the stakeholders about these changes? They might have concerns or require updates. It would be good to keep everyone informed. Alright, adding that to the list. Now, let's summarize everything clearly without getting too detailed. Make sure each point is concise and actionable. No fluff, just the facts. Hmm… Is there anything else? Oh yeah, I should make sure that the communication channels are updated so that stakeholders are aware of the new plans. Otherwise, there might be confusion later on. Okay, that covers most of it. With all these steps in place, I'm confident we can overcome the challenges and meet our deadlines. Focusing on what needs to be done and breaking it down will help prevent last-minute rushes and stress. Alright, I think that's everything. Time to put it all together coherently without missing any crucial points. Keeping it straightforward and to the point will ensure clarity and effectiveness.",
