Like last year we’re going to structure feedback as looking for the good the bad and the ugly:\n\nThe good: What worked well? What did you find particularly beneficial to your team? What would you like to see more of?\n\nThe bad: What didn’t work? What did you struggle with? What would you like to see changed?\n\nThe ugly: What did you have to hack around to make it work for you? What made figuring out the right solution more difficult for you (e.g. wasted precious time)?\n\nWe’ll be using this feedback to evaluate priorities during the upcoming offseason. Any feedback is valuable – if we don’t know about it we can’t fix it! As PhotonVision is an open-source community project run by students alumni and working professionals in their free time the best way to see a feature get implemented is to implement it yourself or get someone in the community interested in implementing it. We welcome both ideas and contributors!\n\nThe most permanent way to make sure a particular issue doesn’t get lost in the noise is to open a GitHub issue ticket – we’ll be triaging these as we move into the offseason.\n\nWe’re also interested in the cameras and coprocessors you’re using. We would appreciate if you can fill out the survey below so that we can identify areas of focus for the offseason.\n\ndocs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSesrJfPiouxTSdv_Ke2NGHEVVKsnhkQKXqvat85gFQEAUu-wg/viewform?usp=dialog This form is private\n\nHere’s a spreadsheet of all the responses for data analysis: docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JDvl16I2n9pY_JhoOPynfvgrstvxJfTo8WkOWOaWqeA/edit?usp=sharing",

However, we encountered intermittent issues with camera connectivity, which became less frequent as the project progressed, ultimately prompting limited reliance on vision systems toward the end of the competition.  \n\nWe improved upon this by tilting one camera upward to enhance viewability and faced challenges in determining the appropriate translation matrix for accurate pose detection, which was largely due to our insufficient knowledge rather than a lack of sample resources or guidance. Additionally, we struggled with overheating in a Pi module because it was deployed without adequate cooling solutions, suggesting potential benefits from incorporating heatsinks or fans in future projects. Despite these hiccups, PhotonVision proved successful for us personally and within the team, particularly due to my argument against purchasing integrated vision processors, opting instead for a solution that would meet our needs more effectively and affordably.",

While managing multiple cameras was straightforward, the initial setup using copy-pasted or template code was quick. Calibrating devices minimized trial-and-error thanks to robust calibration features. Device documentation served as an invaluable resource, making complex operations simple. Vision simulation proved to be swift and efficient, adding value without complications. However, challenges arose with camera setups and consistent tagging. Cameras occasionally failed on startup, necessitating frequent resets. Despite setting names/serials, specific USB ports were assigned, complicating troubleshooting due to inadequate device ID handling. Struggles continued with multi-tag filtering, where scaling adjustments were crucial for accurate results. Default settings were too aggressive, causing issues during practice. Object detection training proved demanding, requiring extensive tweaking. An experienced guide would have streamlined the process. Though initially frustrating, the system became dependable and effective upon resolving issues. Satisfaction grew with reliability and precision, solidifying its effectiveness. Future use remains confident.",

                    "cooked": "The system is extremely easy to set up and works exceptionally well. It is significantly more affordable than Limelight, with parts available on Amazon and typically ready for use within a day. Cameras can be individually positioned, swapped, and relocated without the need for complex computational setups. However, the system presents several challenges. There are excessive customization options, leading many teams to feel overwhelmed when deciding on hardware purchases and assessing performance metrics. Additionally, teams often lack knowledge about the importance of calibration, particularly when dealing with multi-camera setups requiring hot swaps. Clear guidance on calibration processes, including multi-tag filtering, prioritization, standard deviation tuning, and object detection, would greatly enhance the system's usability.",

                    "cooked": "Initial setup and calibration for 3 cameras (across 2 co-processors) was painless and took approximately 2 hours. This is our second year using PhotonVision, so we primarily reused our robot-side pose estimation code, which was already well-tuned for filtering vision measurements, thereby significantly reducing the setup time. We implemented the cscore frame time fix and observed no degradation in system performance, contrary to expectations. Despite not rigorously analyzing reported frame latency, we assume the reported ~80% FPS improvement maintained pose accuracy. All our robot logs from the 2025 season are publicly available on GitHub. Notably, we successfully employed both new solve methods: PNP_DISTANCE_TRIG_SOLVE due to its stability and CONSTRAINED_SOLVEPNP with headingFree = true. These methods proved better suited for this year's challenges compared to MULTI_TAG_PNP_ON_COPROCESSOR, as we rarely encountered simultaneous multi-tag observations from a single camera. Our co-processors occasionally failed to boot into the OS, but we resolved this issue by monitoring the status light on the Orange Pi. Relaying instructions to our drive team to power-cycle the device prevented failures. We faced issues with old heading data poising future estimates after pose resets, particularly early in autonomous operations. We mitigated this by clearing the heading buffer manually in our PhotonPoseEstimator. Later, we switched to using constrained solvePNP to determine our initial field position without resetting pose. While this resolved the issue, it may still pose risks for others. We plan to address this in a future PR. Overall, our experience with PhotonVision this year was highly positive, and we look forward to continuing with it. Thank you to the maintainers and contributors for their hard work!",

Without a solution, manual flipping of autoexposure was necessary upon robot booting during every competition, which required remembering to do so each time.\n\nIn rare cases, about once every 50 matches, either during practice or competition, one of our camera streams would abruptly shut down and reset. This typically occurred when pose accuracy dropped notably.

While experimenting with the `Transform3d` helps identify the correct mount angles, especially when using the cartoonish representation of the robot and target with numerical poses, adjustments might still be needed based on actual measurements. \n\nCreating a `PhotonPoseEstimator` requires specifying the `Transform3d` representing the robot-relative location and orientation of the camera. This `Transform3d` comprises a `Translation3d` (in meters) and a `Rotation3d` (in radians). For more details on the coordinate system, refer to [Coordinate Systems](https://docs.photonvision.org/en/latest/docs/aprilateral-pipelines/coordinate-systems.html).\n\nA common setup initializes this transform as:\n```java\npublic static final Transform3d kRobotToCam = new Transform3d(\n    new Translation3d(0.5, 0.0, 0.5),\n    new Rotation3d(0, 0, 0)\n);\n```",

The situation occurred during a practice session on Curie where one of the team members missed an opportunity to adjust camera settings correctly after transitioning into teleoperational mode. Despite efforts to improve communication and workflow during subsequent practices, similar issues persisted. While the team explored solutions involving advanced monitoring tools and alternative methods to manage camera streams, ultimately, such fixes were only implemented during at-home training sessions due to the constraints of competition environments.",
