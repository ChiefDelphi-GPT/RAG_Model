We could do a RAID 1 to ensure boot volume protection as well as some data retention.\n\nAdditionally many laptops today don’t have full size Ethernet ports so we are going to have to get a port replicator. I worry about the reliability of such devices as I use a thunderbolt dock at work and I’ve ran into random issues with it. How do you overcome issues like this?",

Here’s some thoughts we had last year when buying a new one:\n\nWe have the budget to afford a laptop that is solely the driver’s station, and we have a few other laptops for shared use. (All of our code team has our own laptops; design is something we’re working on but that’s out of the scope of this.) This means that we can avoid having any extra software running.\n\nWe knew we wanted an in-built ethernet port so we could run without a dongle, but (in order to preserve the port since it’s constantly getting plugged in and unplugged, and especially because it’s one of those ports where the bottom is on a lever) we almost always run with a simple male to female cable and leave the adapter plugged in unless there’s an issue (and make sure it’s one that doesn’t just come out - one of the adapters we tried could just be pulled out if you applied upwards pressure).\n\nIn a similar vein to wearing out the ethernet, we plug our controllers into a USB hub and leave the hub plugged in constantly.\n\n(Yes, these do make disconnects during a match more likely, but that is not an issue we have had this year or last year, the laptop isn’t actually moving during a match, and I’d rather lose a match because the hub or ethernet adapter came out than have our laptop’s ethernet die and need to quickly buy a replacement which isn’t cheap.)\n\nDon’t get more than you need. Getting a laptop with an inbuilt GPU for example is another thing that can fail. I know these don’t directly answer the question of hardware failures but it’s a few thoughts I had that I wanted to share.",
