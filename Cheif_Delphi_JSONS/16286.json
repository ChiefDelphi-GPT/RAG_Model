For some reason, when I tried to compile it, the connection in USB type-c cable or wireless via radio was taking a time of 8/10 minutes or more. In this case, I was using Windows. So, I switch to Linux and tried to deploy, to test how much the deploy delays to send the code. Now, the code was taking a time of 2/3 minutes. Why in the first case the robot code deploy is slow? I updated the WPILib packages in RoboRIO and computer, but it didn’t work. If you use a another robot code, the delay doesn’t change and doesn’t show errors in the terminal or Driver Station.",
