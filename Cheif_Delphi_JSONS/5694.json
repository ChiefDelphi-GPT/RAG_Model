This class is intended for students on our team, but we figured it would be a useful resource to share with the community.\n\nThe class is based on a class I did a few years ago for my former team (FRC5413) now adapted for Onshape.\n\nThe class sessions will be once weekly on Mondays 7pm-9pm CT (8pm-10pm ET).  The first session will be May 30th (it’s a holiday, but 10 weeks starts to run into our fall activities if we start a week later).\n\nThe class will include lessons on peripheral engineering topics that will be needed to be successful in designing robots during a season. The format of the class session will be:\n\n30min for an engineering topic or discussion about a common type of robot mechanism in FRC.\n\n30min for a highlight of common off-the-shelf components that we buy and use on our robots.\n\n1hr for self-paced hands-on CAD practice. I will pre-record a video that students will follow along with to perform the CAD exercises for that week.\n\nI will be live streaming the first hour of the class on our YouTube channel .  I will be working through the CAD practice live with the RoboChargers students, but I’m not going to bother streaming that.  Those of you following along will have access to the pre-recorded CAD video and I will answer any questions in this thread.\n\nI’ll post the video and slides in this thread each week.\n\nA few disclaimers:\n\nThis class is very focused on our team, so the CAD topics are tailored to our manufacturing resources, preferred suppliers, and design style.  We’ll be teaching our methods of modeling, file organization, part numbering, etc. which might not work best for all teams.\n\n2022 was the first season of Onshape for 3005 so we’re still working a few things out.\n\nAny experienced Onshape users, robot designers, or general CAD users feel free to chime in with feedback on the class content or design practices.",

Anyone can join in and interact through the youtube live chat (ask questions and such) for the first hour (general engineering topics rather than CAD).  After that I’m planning on ending the stream and answering questions about the pre-recorded CAD video(s) here in this thread (I’ll be at my keyboard for prompt responses for the second hour of the class so it’ll be pretty much live).\n\nThere are certain parts of the class that will be a bit different for non-robochargers students (e.g. I’m going to walk through the process of adding them to our workspace in the class but obviously won’t invite outside people).  Some adaptation to the format would need to be made in order to get your students into your own team’s workspace.  I’m just going to be using www.onshape4frc.com as a resource so feel free to work through their “Getting Started” section at any point before the class starts.\n\nIf you had in mind a more integrated involvement in the class for your students, we can probably work something out.  Just shoot me a DM in that case.\n\nI’m finalizing some stuff for the class this afternoon.  I’ll post the topic schedule and pre-requisites here soon.",

Here are some of the things you need in order to participate:\n\nDecent internet connection.  Need to have access to most FRC supplier websites as well as McMaster Carr.\n\nComputer of some sort (Onshape supports a lot of platforms so even a chromebook is probably good enough for the class).  That being said, it needs to have decent graphics support for doing any kind of complicated model (we’ll do a few later in the class).\n\nGeneral computer use experience.\n\nMouse with scroll wheel and “middle click” functionality.",

The important stuff is that you’re introduced to some concepts and know what to look up in the future. If you want to take the quiz while listening to the training, or looking through the slide - great! If you want to see how much you remember after listening to it a week ago - great!",
