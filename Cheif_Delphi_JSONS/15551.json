We have done everything according the docs. I have attached some videos where you can see our robot drift quite a but by simply going back and forth, and the bigger problem we are facing is when rotating and moving in any direction, it almost begins to pivot on one module rotating around its self. We aren’t sure what the problem is and have dine everything according to the sds template. I have also attached a video of our modules as they move in all directions near the end is when we rotate and go forward at the same time. Thanks for any help in advance!\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1XxSsy8QRLnJm7wogKuUK-ewoeOgp_ZIP/view?usp=drivesdk\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y2byu3CS7ff6wSukUGQI3mdP5Bld3wEx/view?usp=drivesdk\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y8IgHwVhwfS_JAwKTlbqWGb2op4T5TQx/view?usp=drivesdk",

Remember counter clockwise is negative.\n\nVerify your geometry for the kinematics.  The number passed in is the offset from center of rotation for each module.  If not defined correctly your center of rotation will not the be the center of your bot. It should look something like this.\n\nVerify the 0 of your wheels.  that is Are they pointing straight forward and parallel (use a straight board) when it is turned on?\n\nIs the gyro coming unplugged from the can or power.   We had an odd problem where the drivers kept reporting that the swerve would switch back and forth between field oriented and bot oriented drive.  It became bot oriented drive when the power was lost to the pigeon (gyro) and the pigeon would be reporting 0 as the angle.\n\nTry the rotation very slowly and see if you have the same center of rotation issue that may tell you if you have a loose connection somewhere.\n\nThat is all I have for ideas.  You may also want to post a link to your code in github or post it on here so people can take a look to see if there is a conversion issue somewhere.\n\nYou said you used swervelib, did you start with the swerve template?  That is where we started.  IT is pretty good you have to add some more to it to get autonomous information and drive but it is a great start.",

                    "cooked": "It’s a little hard to tell what’s going on from the videos, but the video of underneath the robot shows something that might be wrong, if I’m viewing it correctly.  At the end of that video, it appears that you are trying to rotate while moving linearly.  Again, it’s hard to tell, but I don’t think the wheels on the left side of the screen are pointed correctly to do that.  It looks like they are pointed almost directly at the corresponding wheel on the other side of the robot, which I don’t think is correct (i.e., parallel to the nearest wall of the robot).\n\nThat could be because of a software problem, where you are instructing the wheel to move to the wrong direction, or a hardware problem where the encoder is giving you false information or the motor is not behaving properly.\n\nWhen my team is facing a vexing problem like this, I always encourage them to break it down into smaller problems to try to diagnose.  For example:\n\n-Turn each wheel by hand through a few full rotations, and log out the angle being produced by the encoders.  Do they always produce the correct value? -Turn each wheel by hand and make sure that they all turn smoothly. -“Drive” each wheel by hand and make sure they all drive smoothly. -Write some simple test code that directs each wheel to a few test angles (outside of the complexity of your whole code base).  Validate that each wheel behaves as expected. -Write some simple test that directs each wheel to spin forwards (outside of the complexity of your whole code base).  Validate that each wheel is spinning in the same direction and roiligjly the same speed. -In the main swerve code, log out the desired angle of each wheel and the actual angle, perhaps to the smartdashboard.  They should track pretty closely together.\n\nOne of these test will likely fail, and then you’ll have something more narrow to focus on fixing.",

I don’t believe that the gyro coming unplugged is the problem, it would sometimes switch off field orientated but not when moving at speeds I would consider fast enough to unplug the gyro’s connection to the roborio. We kind of started with the swerve template, we took the drive train and replaced it with our old code and it has been modified in no significant way other than adding methods for other subsystems/commands or to fit our Constants style. We did test the robot on our old code and it acts the same, we are decently sure it’s a gyro problem but we don’t what exactly",

We also noticed that the tire belts screws on our robot were sticking out now, as the track got worn down so we tightened them and that helped with another issue we saw where a few of the modules were lifting off the ground.\n\nSo after these chains of issues were solved we noticed that the module are now slightly off. We will be realigning them when we next meet, and we’ll be sure to have them be the best aligned modules anyone has ever seen. I’ll report back with the result after all this. We are also adding locktite to a few screws we noticed were loosening.\n\nLet’s hope we can finally put these issues behind us, at least for a little bit.",
