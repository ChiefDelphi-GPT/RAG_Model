If you’re referring to the main tubes the bearings ride on, i’d advocate against it.\n\nNot necessarily to be avoided, best as stages not attached to the frame though (for rigidity reasons associated with drilling cross holes).\n\nOP, I do notice you have a rookie number, please be catious of scope creep and designing too much/beyond you means.\n\nA lot of successful bots (only a small handful of which are listed below) have used Carbon Fiber elevators, two world champions in my short cherrypicked  list below, but correlation does not equal causation\n\n254 in 2023\n\n33 in 2019\n\n2767 in 2019 2767 in 2018 2767 in 2023\n\n148 in 2018\n\nProbably a host of TX, East coast, and CA teams as well.\n\nThere have been a lot of CF elevators.  Some using round tube (148 in 2018 I believe, which was a widely copied design for 2019)\n\nSome using square tube (2767 in particular here, although I am sure there are others), common sizes to reduce cost\n\nPlay to the materials strengths, design around dimensions available for the commercial drone market (generally cheaper, see 67’s thoughts on this in 2023)\n\nHigh melt hot glue and quality 3d printing (see 2767’s bots) is an awesome way to avoid cross drilling (and weakening the material)\n\nHave a game plan for how you are going to do a 5 minute repair, a 15minute repair, and a 30 minute repair… Things always break at the worst time. Pre-bent thin aluminum shim sheet stock, hot glue and clamp pressure can get you out of a pinch, effectivly making a splint (important for end effectors, ask me how I know… )\n\nAs always, be mindful of dust and look up how to properly cut the stuff.\n\n@Mark_Wasserman @Sam_Dare @Cory_Walters did I miss anything?",

If this is brand new to you, build season isn’t the best time to test new build systems. I’d suggest you wait until offseason and then build some test pieces there to get familiar with how to best use the material.\n\nPiggy-backing off of Skye’s reply, definitely have a plan to swap out parts since they won’t bend and typically just shear or shatter if they fail. Having a set of replacements (either CF or aluminum) to drop in will save you a lot of headache.",

Think of most exotic materials as being the equivalent of “take the tightrope shortcut across the fast-moving river, instead of the longer path around.”  That is to say, if you aren’t good at using them, there’s a greater chance your robot ends up nonfunctional, rather than functional, but slightly slower/heavier/bulkier when made of good ol’ 6061-T6 aluminum.\n\nSkyehawk:\n\nAs always, be mindful of dust and look up how to properly cut the stuff.\n\nAnd remember that you can’t cut it at all at competition, as it falls under R203, part K in the blue box.  You must be prepared to repair CFRP parts without sanding, which means you may need to bring spares replace them completely.\n\nIt may also help to think of CFRP and FRP (fiberglass) as though they behave like very strong wood: bendy, but brittle, with a meaningful grain (anisotropic), and less tolerant of point loads and stress risers than most metals (glued joints preferred).\n\nThis is probably the best, concise account of CFRP on an FRC robot: Team 254 Presents: 2023 BREAKDOWN - Technical Binder, Code, Q&A - #56 by Torrance",
