There’s pretty much 3 levels of music specifically for YouTube (this is a gross generalization, I’m not a music/copyright lawyer but I have some pretty good experience on this).\n\nTL:DR There’s what is practical (below) and some things that are technically correct.\n\nMusic that is free and clear (or not detected by YT). Nothing Happens. Sometimes it gets flagged later and sometimes it’s flagged by a bot that is not even on behalf of the artist and just trying to claim ad $ falsely.\n\nMusic that is free and clear (or not detected by YT).

Sometimes this is only blocked for specific countries (example: UMG tends to block in Russia and Belarus) of which you are probably fine unless you specifically want your video to show in those markets.\n\nIf you ever want to test a very easy way is to just upload something random with the song to YT. See what happens or search for that song especially ones that are not official like lyrics on screen. The majority of popular music will be detected immediately and YT will tell you. The image is an example of an upload we did of Premiere Night Finale teams. In this case FUN does not receive any Ad Revenue from this video and you can see that YouTube automatically attributed the music here.\n\nIt’s like this because essentially YT is doing the legwork of working out licensing agreements on your behalf.\n\nimage 875×736 134 KB\n\nimage 875×736 134 KB\n\nimage 875×736 134 KB",

Sometimes it gets flagged later and sometimes it’s flagged by a bot that is not even on behalf of the artist and just trying to claim ad $ falsely.\n\nThis has happened to our church service several times. Even though we only use music from free sources, from providers that give rights to it. The pastor protests the flag, and eventually it gets cleared. It’s apparent that there are bots that scan YouTube and take hits on anything, because if they get 1 in 1000 right they get some kind of “finder’s fee”.",
