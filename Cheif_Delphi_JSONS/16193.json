                    "cooked": "Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a methodology in which at any point in the design process you have a product that is feasible, while adding additional ‘layers’ to increase functionality. How do you balance this with choosing a specialized design? Using 2017 as an example, some robots only ran gears, and some chose to do gears and fuel. I would imagine a robot designed to do just gears would perform better than a robot that was designed for gears while not ruling out the option of doing fuel (ie. designing around the possibility of fuel).\n\nHow do you determine if you should design for the possibility of adding something vs. ruling it out altogether? I think from a scoring analysis and team resource evaluation you can figure out what to do vs. what not to do, but determining if you should be able to do something later on seems like a gray area to me.",

So think more of “we think a pneumatic grip will be a good way to pick up a gear, what’s the fastest and cheapest way we can build an MVP to prove or disprove that?” It’s part of the “build-measure-learn” feedback cycle that came from the book.\n\nAn MVP can be thrown out once you’ve proven the hypothesis if necessary. It’s the minimum amount of work for us to learn, not necessarily go to production with.\n\nAgile is possibly a better methodology here. In Agile we tend to have a fixed deadline (or series of deadlines) and scope is variable. So we may decide to do both gears and fuel, and come up with some milestones with which to decide if we’re going to toss one or the other in order to meet the deadline.\n\nOf course, that’s all what the book says, and actually doing it is part of the fun of FIRST.",

It was obvious that you shouldn’t mess with it, right from the beginning.\n\nBut for more balanced scoring objectives…yeah, it’s tricky. We tend to look at what our team’s abilities are to be able to complete something, and we usually can just barely get the stuff done that we consider to be minimum (usually the main scoring objective, and the end game). Some are kind of subtle, we figured out that we needed to do cargo and panels in 2019, along with the end game, but limited ourselves to the lower to levels, because we knew we wouldn’t be able to fill them up in a match, and if we were teamed with a fast robot, they could do the high stuff.\n\nI don’t know how to make these decisions with charts and numbers any more, although we’ve done it in the distant past.",

I wonder how this changes when looking at how a game evolves. Using 2017 again, you could analyze the game and say that fuel is worth little and won’t be a deciding factor in low-level play. Now, if a team says they want to win a week 1 event, it would behoove them to focus on gears and climbing before fuel. But if they also have a goal of winning a late season event (DCMP/week 6 regional), now fuel becomes more important. In my mind, you’d have to decide to do fuel right from the beginning for it to be effective at the end. Spend as much effort on fuel as you would gears and climb when designing, but when practicing and optimizing make sure you get gears and climb down before fuel.",
