                    "cooked": "For our robot, we need our NEO motor to spin faster over one half of the revolution until it hits a certain position, then spin slower over the other half until it completes a full revolution. We currently have a NEO Brushless 1.1 in a 36:1 gearbox hooked up to a Spark MAX controller and we’re controlling the motor through PWM (coding in C++).\n\nRight now, what we’re doing is running the motor at a higher duty cycle at a given delay to spin for a half revolution, then spinning it at a lower duty cycle for a longer delay to complete the revolution. However, this isn’t very precise, and the motor completes the full cycle after around 365 degrees. After many cycles, this 5 degree offset compounds.\n\nOne option that we have is to use a limit switch. The limit switch will cue the motor when to stop to prevent the motor arm from spinning too far. Our only concern is that the motor still spins pretty fast over the slow section (around 40 RPM ), and this limit switch will quickly accumulate thousands of cycles.\n\nWith the NEO and SparkMAX set up, do we have access to any position data that can help add precision to our set up? I’m hoping we don’t have to purchase the Through Bore Encoder because the Absolute Encoder Adapter and the Data Port Breakout Board are both out of stock. The Alternate Adapter is in stock, but it doesn’t seem like exactly what we want.",

                    "cooked": "Thanks for the response.\n\nOur fundamental idea is we want to move an indoor rowing machine back and forth with certain timing to simulate rowing on a boat. Our idea is we have a motor on a linear track, and it has a weight attached to an extension of the rotor arm. The half rotation was a bit of a simplification as to not overcomplicate the blurb, but we want this weight to spin fast when it’s aligned with the linear track, and spin slower when it’s lateral to the track, to apply a centripetal acceleration to roll the whole system back and forth along the track with the correct timing. We didn’t want to use an actuator because the rower should be able to resist the force generated by the motor - if we used an actuator, the rower’s movement would be constrained.\n\nSo, we want the motor to spin fast for the quarter of the rotation it’s aligned with the forward direction of the track, spin slow when it gets to the next quarter that’s lateral to the track, then spin fast again when it gets to the backward direction of the track, and finish by spinning slow back to its starting position.\n\nDo you not think the Through Bore Encoder would give us the precision to control the NEO as intended? We originally wanted a stepper motor but they were out of budget given our high power needs. It seems like the Through Bore Encoder will give us a lot of position data that we can use to locate the motor arm to have it spin fast/slow at the correct spots.",

Is it a spur gearbox, or planetary and what is its output.\n\nMichaelRemi:\n\ncoding in C++\n\nI assume this is non- FRC application, so you’re using something like arduino to create the PWM signal. Could you provide a little more info about what controller you’re using and how you’re programming it?\n\nMichaelRemi:\n\nHowever, this isn’t very precise, and the motor completes the full cycle after around 365 degrees. After many cycles, this 5 degree offset compounds.\n\nWhat level of precision do you need? Is it okay if the rotation is detected within one or two degrees, as long as the error does not build up over multiple rotation?\n\nYou have two problems:\n\nAccurately measuring the rotation of your output shaft.\n\nAccurately measuring the rotation of your output shaft.\n\nControlling your machine to the desired position based on the rotation.\n\nControlling your machine to the desired position based on the rotation.\n\nFor problem one, as people have indicated, an absolute encoder attached to the output shaft would be ideal. One people use a lot for FRC in the Thrifty Magnetic Encoder. It gives an analog signal out, which you could read with an arduino (and it works in both 3.3V and 5V mode I believe). You would have to drill a 1/4\" hole in your output shaft and glue in a magnet.\n\n﻿Note: Molded plastic cases have begun shipping with all encoder orders!﻿ The Thrifty Absolute Magnetic Encoder was designed to provide teams a lower cost option for absolute position sensing. Simply plug the included 3-wire PWM style cable...\n\nPrice: USD 29.99\n\nIf you have a smaller output shaft, one possibility is the CUI AMT102 (it is not absolute but instead has a “index” signal that triggers once per rotation). It comes with mounts for small round shafts. There are probably other absolute encoders you can buy.\n\nhttps://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/cui-devices/AMT102-V/827015\n\nIf you can’t spend more money, one harder option would to be read the output of the NEOs built-in hall effect sensor. Based on some other CD searches I believe it has three phases which each go high 7 times per revolution (so with Arduino you could trigger an interrupt whenever the input from each phase changes, which happens 42 times per revolutions, so 1512 for one full rotation of your machine). Some experimentation might have to happen to make sure this works correctly (and it’s a 5V input so make sure your controller can handle this).\n\nThis option would be sufficient if you were find with a little bit of error (due to backlash), as long as it didn’t add up a little bit over time. It will also be more complicated to program.\n\nPWM SparkMax Encoder Programming\n\nAnother option you may not have considered is a string potentiometer along the linear track, but your explanation doesn’t make enough sense to me to determine whether I’d recommend it.\n\nIn general, the encoder choice is going to be driven by the mechanical mounting constraints (i.e. what you’re output shaft is and what fabrication abilities you have available) and the controller you’re using.\n\nFor problem 2, it sounds like you could just change the percent output based on the measured rotation, but their might be more complex things you can try based on what you desire the behavior to be (for example do you desire a constant force during parts of the rotation).",

To answer some of your questions: 1: We’re using a 36:1 planetary gearbox with a hex shaft output. https://www.andymark.com/products/cim-sport-options?via=Z2lkOi8vYW5keW1hcmsvV29ya2FyZWE6OkNhdGFsb2c6OkNhdGVnb3J5LzViMzY1MGNlYmM2ZjZkM2UyNzczOGY5MQ&Ratio=36%3A1%20HD%20(am-4008_036)&quantity=1\n\n2: We’re using an ESP-32. The general way we’re coding it right now is sending PWM (duty_cycle) to the motor to spin for a given time period, then having it spin at PWM (lower_duty_cycle) to spin for another given time period.\n\n3: A 1-2 degree error per revolution is totally fine. The main issue is the accumulation of this error. This machine will complete around 20 full revolutions per minute and we want to have this running for at least 30 minutes at a time, so this small error can compound quickly.\n\nOur current path forward seems to try to connect the Through Bore Encoder to an Alternate Encoder Adapter on the Spark MAX because the Absolute is out of stock. The issue with this set up is trying to figure out the starting position. We may try to work around this by having a homing sequence with a limit switch before starting the full operation.",

The issue with this set up is trying to figure out the starting position.\n\nYou don’t want to do this because you don’t have any way to read the encoder’s output when you’re controlling it over PWM . People who are recommending it are probably used to controlling a SparkMAX over CAN , if I’m not missing something. If you’re going to use through-bore encoder you’d just using the included wiring adapter ( JST PH 6-pin to 4 Channel PWM Cable - 1m - REV Robotics ) to directly read the outputs.\n\nHowever, the problem is the ESP32 does not have any obvious way to convert the PWM output to a measured angle. Based on some searches you could try to use interrupts or maybe the RMT interface to do so, but as someone who works with the ESP32 professionally I’d consider that advanced/difficult and I’m not sure how well either would work. I did find this RMT library for the esp32 that seems to solve this problem: GitHub - rewegit/esp32-rmt-pwm-reader: esp32 8 channel rc-pwm-reader for arduino framework , so maybe it’s easier than my first reaction.\n\nThe other methods to use the through-bore encoder would be to design a low pass filter/integrator to convert the pwm output to an analog value, or to find a chip that does so (LTC 2645 seems like it would work), but at that point why use the through-bore. You could also use the quadrature and index outputs (again just connecting them to ESP32 GPIO) but there would also be some complications there, and you’d have to spin the device at least once before being able to detect it’s absolute rotation (using the index input).\n\nI still like the idea of drilling a hole in the end of the shaft, gluing in a magnet, and using the thrifty encoder (set to 3.3V mode), which you should be able to read easily with ESP32.\n\nMichaelRemi:\n\nWe’re using an ESP-32.\n\nAre you using the Arduino libraries or ESP-IDF directly?",

That’s a much better suggestion, so the through-bore encoder would definitely be usable. Sorry for the oversight.\n\nI would warn that the pulseIn function uses busy waiting (i.e. checking the value of the input repeatedly in a loop), so you’ll have to wait up to 2ms for a response, during which time no other code can run on that core. The arduino docs also say that the minimum pulse length that pulseIn can’t read inputs less than 10 us (the minimum pulse is 1 us), but I’m pretty sure that’s for an AVR arduino, since looking at the pulseIn ESP implementation, it should be able to handle a pulse width as small a few hundred ns. (Edit: This also means a normal arduino would be worse for this).\n\nThis limitation is probably fine for your application. Just don’t call it more than once per iteration. I would also decrease the maximum timeout to something like 10 ms.\n\nAnother thing to be wary of is that is that if an interrupt triggers or the task is preempted, you won’t get an accurate reading. I don’t think this should be an issue because most of the background tasks like wifi, Bluetooth run on core 0 I believe, while Arduino runs on core 1. But if you have issues with inaccurate readings, that’s something to look into, and anyways I would make sure to filter readings much longer that the through-bore encoders maximum pulse length.\n\nTo provide more explanation of how you would use pulseIn, you’d wire the absolute PWM output of the through bore to any GPIO pin (and +V to 3.3V and GND to GND). In the the through-bore encoder documentation, there’s a maximum and minimum pulse width, corresponding to 0 degrees and just before 360 degrees. You’d read the length of the pulse in microseconds with pulseIn , and use an offset and a scale factor based on the minimum and maximum pulse length to convert it to degrees.",
