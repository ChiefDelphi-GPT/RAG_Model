                    "cooked": "Hi there, I’m a member of team 1477 and have been working on a configurable round tube elevator design over the past month. The design is inspired by the 148 2018 round tube elevator. I would appreciate any feedback/questions on the design.\n\nimage 755×1212 125 KB image 785×1110 118 KB\n\nimage 755×1212 125 KB\n\nimage 755×1212 125 KB\n\nimage 785×1110 118 KB\n\nimage 785×1110 118 KB\n\nDesign Goals:\n\nContinuous Rigging\n\nCapstan Gearbox\n\nConstructed from (mostly) plate and tube\n\nConfigurable amount of stages (1+)\n\nLightweight\n\nQuick Facts :\n\nCompressed Height: 37 in.\n\nExtended Height: 84 in.\n\nTotal weight: 13.55 Lbs\n\nStages: The stages of the elevator consist of a “stage cap” and “stage plug” which contain all the pulleys, rollers, and structural components of each stage (pictured below). The stage cap and stage plug are joined together using two 1.5 OD 1/32 wall tubes.\n\nStage cap: image 989×473 61.3 KB A stage cap consists of two bearing block assemblies, a 1.5 OD 1/32 wall tube, and two 3/8 Aluminum Gussets connecting the bearing block assemblies and cross tube together.\n\nimage 989×473 61.3 KB\n\nimage 989×473 61.3 KB\n\nCross section of a bearing block assembly:\n\nimage 796×828 79.8 KB\n\nimage 796×828 79.8 KB\n\nimage 796×828 79.8 KB\n\nEach bearing block assembly contains two 1x1 WCP tube plugs in a 3dp sleeve and a billet block underneath. The components are tied together using two .09 Al gussets, which also hold the roller bearing.\n\nStage Plug: image 828×493 53.2 KB Each stage plug contains the same bearing block assembly as the stage cap (but upsidedown), and uses 1.5 x1.5 tube for the main structure. The stage plugs also have tiny “wings” that contact hardstops on the upright round tubes to maintain proper overlap between stages.\n\nimage 828×493 53.2 KB\n\nimage 828×493 53.2 KB\n\nRoller Bearing The hardest part of this elevator was designing the roller bearings. The intent for this roller bearing design was to capture as much of the tube as possible while still keeping the gap between the stages low. Currently this design captures approx 35% of the tube face and allows for a .25 in. gap between stages.\n\nThe main roller bearing body is 3d printed, and has a .25 OD .201 ID shaft pressed into to strengthen the part. The roller bearing also has a .5 OD .188 ID bearing to support the radial load and a needle roller bearing to support axial loads. Although this design is meant to be 3d printed, we have a 4th axis on our OMIO X8 and will most likely machine it out of delrin if possible.\n\nimage 784×660 81.5 KB image 733×655 40.6 KB\n\nimage 784×660 81.5 KB\n\nimage 784×660 81.5 KB\n\nimage 733×655 40.6 KB\n\nimage 733×655 40.6 KB\n\nRigging: Elevator has continuous rigging, with the ropes hidden behind the 1.5 round tube uprights. The rope starts at the top of the carriage, runs through the pulleys & the capstan gearbox, and terminates at the bottom of the carriage. A 1/2 hex shaft connected to a ratchet wrench on the top of the carriage tensions the rope to remove any slack.\n\nCapstan Gearbox: image 1349×806 154 KB image 1304×901 161 KB image 1172×618 95.8 KB\n\nimage 1349×806 154 KB\n\nimage 1349×806 154 KB\n\nimage 1304×901 161 KB\n\nimage 1304×901 161 KB\n\nimage 1172×618 95.8 KB\n\nimage 1172×618 95.8 KB\n\nThe capstan gearbox is different from a conventional elevator spool system in that it uses the friction between the rope & capstan (black thing with ridges) to cause the rope to move along, rather than spooling and unspooling the rope.\n\nBenefits of the capstan gearbox are:\n\nCapstan diameter can be much smaller than a standard elevator rope spool\n\nNo spooling string means no dealing with issues regarding variable fleet angles and rope spooling on top of itself\n\nSmaller diameter capstans allow for a lower gear reduction, saving weight\n\nThe capstan gearbox in this pic is integrated into the 2x1 base tube, which allows it to neatly tuck underneath the elevator. Currently there is 1 Neo geared 3:1 to power the system, but the gearbox can accept up to 2 motors and any of the COTS planetary gearboxes.",
