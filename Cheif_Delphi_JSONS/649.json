                    "cooked": "Hi all,\n\nI’m interested in hearing some opinions from you guys before my team regroups to make a decision. Recently, our team went up to the North Star Regional with our robot to participate. We went up with pretty much the Kitbot, featuring tank drive and the ability to do a shallow climb. For us, we did great. Our robot was a team player for our abilities, and we had few issues with everything that happened being fixable. We made some changes to our autonomous, fixed our shallow climb being too low, and were set. Unfortunately, we didn’t place with an alliance, but we still had a great time and learned a lot. Compared to last year, our robot was pretty much a dud and unable to move on the field or even do defense, so this was an upgrade for us.\n\nIMG_1981 1920×1280 211 KB\n\nIMG_1981 1920×1280 211 KB\n\nIMG_1981 1920×1280 211 KB\n\nAs our team begins to regroup following our regional, we’ve discussed trying different drive trains and seeing where that could take us. I’ve looked back on our past years, and as far as I can tell, we’ve used tank since the forming of our team, following one year where we attempted Omni and it didn’t work so we went back to tank.\n\nI presented the idea of using a different drive train to our coach, and he seemed very interested since we have a solid team and we can make it happen. We talked about looking into swerve, and I presented an essay with some information about swerve to him and why we should take the time during our off-season to migrate. Our coach was interested, but he wants us to try doing Mecanum first before buying a swerve kit. He reasons that he wants us to work in steps up to swerve, and he claims that the mecanum will be a small step, and then we can take more time to work on swerve. Plus, it will boost our knowledge.\n\nI’m a little worried about our time since we won’t have most of the summer to work on the robot, so I feel this might not work out for us. Personally, I wish we would take the time to migrate to swerve and learn it so then we can work on functionality during the season- I worry if we do both mecanum and swerve we will start running into interference with the season which then we won’t have time to work on functionality during the season.\n\nI wanted to get some thoughts from you guys. Based on what you can see from the photo, and that our robot can only do a shallow climb with placing on the L1, would switching our robot to Mecanum be an upgrade from what we currently have? Navigating around the field was an issue during competition, mostly because it felt like we had to do all these weird maneuvers to make our robot do what we wanted it to do. I know that Mecanum offers more maneuverability on the field, and I feel that would help us out, but as far as lining up with the station and going back, would that be more difficult with Mecanum if we switched?\n\nI’m hoping that in the future, we can attempt to migrate to swerve- That’s my true long-term goal. I’m absolutely in love with swerve, and I feel it would help our team at competition a lot more with the things it offers than what Tank is offering us right now. But at the moment, I’m wondering if switching to Mecanum would benefit us since that’s what my coach would like to do, and if our off-season event would go better if we used Mecanum instead of tank. And then, if all goes well, we can look into swerve and go from there.\n\nLet me know what you guys think! I’m interested in feedback, and my team is as well. We’re all looking for ideas on how we can make this possible and make our robots’ maneuverability better for the future.",

                    "cooked": "My response to your coach would be:\n\n“Mecanum is not a step on the way to swerve. Swerve is a completely different drivetrain, with a completely different setup. Mecanum will be “easier” to install on a kit chassis, even with the extra gearboxes required; however, swerve is rapidly becoming easier to do given the right parts. Either way, mecanum requires a completely different mechanical and programming setup than swerve does. As a matter of practicality, mecanum that isn’t driven like a swerve should really be a tank drive, and mecanum that is driven like a swerve is going to be completely outclassed by every swerve on the field.”\n\nWhat I would NOT tell him is: “Some teams see mecanum and instantly remove that team from any pick lists.” Even though it’s true, it’s still not something that I think needs to be said.\n\nOne other thing:\n\nPercentage of Swerve Drives in 2025 General Forum\n\nI’m going to emphasize this: Rookie teams are pulling off swerve drives. You’ll find the linked thread interesting, as the data shows that swerve is currently the dominant drive style.\n\nStarManTheGamer:\n\nwould switching our robot to Mecanum be an upgrade from what we currently have?\n\nDowngrade. Not upgrade. Sorry. If I were you guys, I’d go for “get cheapest swerve on the market” and drive the absolute snot out of it before the offseason event.",

Mecanum can be a fun academic exercise as part of exploring the history of drivetrains when you have nothing else to do. It’s not suitable for competition today. Get busy on an off-season swerve drive. While the basics are straight-forward, there is a lot to learn in terms of tuning, driver practice, accurate auto path following and maintenance that you don’t want to deal with in-season. We have been doing swerve for 4 years and we still find new things. Mecanum will not help you get there in any way.",

If your driver can reach peak efficiency with your current drivetrain, you will do well. Also look into improving software to help your driver. Each of your Venoms has internal encoders, so try using them to improve autos, or make driver aids.\n\nEricH:\n\nmecanum that isn’t driven like a swerve should really be a tank drive, and mecanum\n\nThis is worth expanding on. When a mecanum strafes or makes any movement non perpendicular to the axis of the wheels it looses efficiency and goes slow. Sometimes, I have seen teams drive it like a tank because of this. (or gear the drivetrain wrong and it overheats when strafing). Your speed and acceleration decrease in these directions. It also means that odometry through the wheels is not possible and you would need dead wheels. Mechanum is also very sensitive to uneven mass distribution.",

I’ve been involved in the design of numerous FRC robots, have helped to start several FRC teams since 1996, and have 40+ years of motor engineering background.  Your team played well with the basic L1 design this year.  More pushing power would have given a small advantage; mecanum drive would have been a very significant disadvantage.\n\nFTC is a great program, and mecanum drive does perform well there.  In Michigan we limit FTC to middle school teams, and many of our best FRC students progress to important roles after starting in FTC .  None of those students would recommend mecanum for an FRC robot.",

I’m not convinced it was ever worth the headache.\n\nIf your center of gravity isn’t perfectly centered over the middle of the robot, you will never, ever drive straight unless you do weird stuff in your code to compensate. This makes programming a competent Mecanum drive far more difficult than it looks on the surface.\n\nI spent 2 years mentoring 3007, a team from your neck of the woods who insisted on Mecanum year after year. We had mentors who were well-versed in wrangling Mecanum’s quirks in code. We had good habits around checking rollers for debris between matches. WE STILL NEVER DROVE STRAIGHT.\n\nBack then, there was (sort of) a case for Mecanum. Yes it was fiddly, you never drove straight, and you always moved slower than everyone else, but you couldn’t get t-boned and tight field geometry wasn’t a hindrance. Nowadays, Swerve delivers on all all of Mecanum’s advantages, does a better job at those advantages than Mecanum can, and has none of the fiddly in-competition annoyances.\n\nThe only game I can think of where Mecanum could have had a net advantage over tank was 2015 - a game unlike any other in the RIO  era, and Mecanum STILL didn’t work great because the weight of the totes threw your CoG totally out of whack while you placed a stack. You either couldn’t drive straight while going to the feeder, or you couldn’t drive straight while placing a stack. Pick your poison.",

Barring a drastic change in rules for 2026, there are two correct answers in my eyes:\n\nThe AM14U6 chassis from the kit, on HiGrip wheels, with your preferred Toughbox Mini ratio and drivetrain motor.  Maybe the 8WD upgrade kit if you expect to burn through wheels.\n\nCOTS swerve.\n\nThe latter, implemented properly, has a much higher competitive ceiling.  But if your resources or bandwidth don’t permit doing swerve, I think the former is still a justifiable choice.",

This makes programming a competent Mecanum drive far more difficult than it looks on the surface.\n\nThank you for clarifying why mechanum is a headache instead of just saying don’t. In perfect scenarios, mechanum is pretty streamlined to get online and functional, and you hop straight to having a holonomic drive train. For this year’s Kitbot, CG is relatively solid, and it might actually make a viable mechanum bot. However, you still need to double up on gearboxes (since each wheel needs it’s own drive), on top of the wheels, so this reduces cost savings a bit.\n\nHowever, CG is not the worst aspect. The moment your frame gets even slightly tweaked, you balance on two opposing wheels, losing control in both axes of motion. This is what happened to us in 2015, which was the first and last year we tried running mechanum. We just ran straight tank until 2024, well after being completely dominated by swerves, but never even seriously considered mechanum again.\n\nFor an interesting cost saving tip, you only need two swerve modules to make a swerve bot. Put them on a diagonal, and use use omni-wheels for the other corners. This is what our practice bot runs, and it works perfectly. The main snag is that most “builder” tools do actually expect 4 modules, so you kind of just ignore two of them and adjust parameters a bit. We use Yagsl, we actually don’t even need to modify code between our two-swerve practice bot and our normal bot. I wouldn’t pitch this for a competition bot, but for a practice testbench?

The easiest way to demonstrate it is to drive a mecanum drive bot forwards, than suddenly sideways. Two of the wheels need to swap directions, but because the wheels and robot has inertia and non-zero latency, the robot skews and you aren’t straight anymore. This isn’t unsolvabe, but it is outside the means of almost every FRC team to solve, hence why most mecanum FRC and FTC bots don’t drive straight to some degree or another unless driven slowly.\n\nIt is possible to solve this problem (I’ve personally done so), its really hard (you need to use a cartesion-space inverse dynamics controller, while extrapolating out latency and avoiding voltage, current, and traction saturations), while swerve is just less susceptible to these issues due to having more traction and throwing 400W brushless motors at the problem.",

No defense, but it was flashy for a team that couldn’t run swerve.\n\nI would highly recommend trying out swerve if you can pull together the funds. There are a lot of great tools out there. For coding there is YAGSL . There are great widening guides and SDS is very straightforward mechanically. (Don’t put magnets upsidown)\n\nHowever it is expensive and our team is lucky to have generous sponsors. I would recommend looking for a grant from a sponsor specifically for a swerve base.

If your driver can reach peak efficiency with your current drivetrain, you will do well\n\nDrive practice is critically important AND swerve gives you two big advantages towards this goal.\n\n(1) Building a swerve drive base is dead easy.  Cut 4 2x1 tubes to the appropriate lengths, bolt on your modules and cut a quick and dirty belly pan out of 5mm plywood. Attach your electronics.  Once you decide on a robot size, you should be up and practicing driving in a day or two.\n\n(2) Swerve gets you “field oriented” (as opposed to “robot oriented”) controls.  This makes driving sooooo much easier.\n\nThis was how we did our “first”{1} swerve, (which we called “Barbie Bot”).\n\nIMG_0010 3024×4032 2.78 MB IMG_0381 4032×3024 4.76 MB\n\nIMG_0010 3024×4032 2.78 MB\n\nIMG_0010 3024×4032 2.78 MB\n\nIMG_0381 4032×3024 4.76 MB\n\nIMG_0381 4032×3024 4.76 MB\n\n.\n\n{1} old timers will perhaps remember our ludicrous home built swerve in 2012",
