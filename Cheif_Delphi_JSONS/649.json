                    "cooked": "Our team recently participated in the North Star Regional with our robot, the Kitbot, equipped with tank drive and the ability to perform a shallow climb. Despite the robot’s strong capabilities and minor issues resolved through fixes, we unfortunately didn’t secure an alliance placement. However, the experience was rewarding, teaching us valuable lessons.\n\nCompared to previous years, our robot struggled with basic movement and defense, making tank drive an upgrade for us moving forward. To explore new possibilities, we considered switching to a different drive train, specifically Mecanum wheels proposed by our coach. He suggested starting with Mecanum due to its enhanced maneuverability on the field, despite concerns about reduced efficiency when navigating towards stations.\n\nSwitching to Mecanum would offer improved field navigation but may complicate station alignment and return paths. Our team is passionate about exploring Swerve as our long-term goal, but transitioning from tank to Mecanum presents a middle ground between stability and adaptability. While we’re open to experimenting, we’re cautiously evaluating whether Mecanum will provide sufficient benefits given our limited off-season preparation time.\n\nUltimately, our interest lies in balancing immediate needs with long-term vision. If the transition to Mecanum proves successful, we can then consider upgrading to Swerve. For now, we’re gathering feedback to decide the best path forward for our team’s growth and competitive edge.",

While Mecanum may seem simpler to set up due to additional gearboxes, Swerve becomes increasingly viable with the right components. Both require unique mechanical setups and programming logic. From a practical standpoint, Mecanum shouldn't mimic Swerve behavior because it could perform worse compared to Swerve-driven robots. My advice is to avoid Mecanum altogether and instead focus on maximizing Swerve capabilities, as it currently dominates in terms of performance and adoption rates.",

We changed the white wheels to black for better traction.\n\nAt the end of the school year last year, we switched to swerve. Over the past few years, we pieced together the swerve system, purchasing parts whenever we could afford them. This year, we ran swerve for the first time.\n\nThere is a knowledge gap we needed to overcome, and we are still learning.\n\nBottom line: If you want a Corvette, never settle for Chevette. There are numerous swerve options available, and while coding can be challenging, there is plenty of support available if you encounter problems.\n\nI would encourage anyone considering a switch to join us in exploring the swerve system—they will never look back once they try it!",

If your driver can reach peak efficiency with your current drivetrain, you will do well. Additionally, consider improving software to enhance your driver. Each of your Venoms has internal encoders, so use them to boost autos or create driver aids. This concept is worth expanding on. A Mecanum drive that isn't driven like a Swerve should ideally be a Tank drive, and Mecanum wheels can lose efficiency when moving non-perpendicularly relative to their axis. Teams sometimes opt to drive it like a Tank due to this inefficiency or issues with drivetrain gearing, which can cause overheating during strafing. Speed and acceleration decrease in such movements, and odometry isn't possible, requiring dead wheels. Mecanum wheels are highly sensitive to uneven mass distribution.",

I’ve been involved in the design of numerous FRC robots since the 1960s, have helped to start several FRC teams since 1996, and have over 40 years of motor engineering background. Your team performed well with the basic L1 design this year. Adding more pushing power would have given a small advantage, while mecanum drive would have been a significant disadvantage. FTC is a great program, and mecanum drive performs well there. However, in Michigan, FTC is limited to middle school teams, and many of our best FRC students progress to important roles after starting in FTC. None of those students would recommend mecanum for an FRC robot.",

It acknowledges that Mecanum is comprehensive but advises against its use now, citing inefficiencies and difficulties in achieving straight movement without extra coding. Mentors who spent two years mentoring a team using Mecanum encountered persistent challenges despite their efforts, highlighting the importance of aligning the center of gravity for successful navigation. In contrast, Swerve robots offer improvements, providing better performance and ease without the drawbacks associated with Mecanum. The text also notes that in certain specific games, such as 2015, Mecanum might have had potential advantages, but these were negated by issues related to tote weights affecting the robot's balance.",

The team 6167 used a Mecanum Everybot to captain roles at their last two FSC events, though there are important considerations:\n\n- They were able to stay out of the way while running processor algae, adding significant value.\n- Their ability to climb during competitions was particularly valuable, as many top teams avoided climbs altogether.\n- This year’s competition became more Mecanum-friendly due to shorter sprints and reduced power loss compared to other robots like Crescendo or Charged Up.\n- This wouldn’t be their first time competing with Mecanum technology.\n\nOur top two robots in the EPA league are ranked #138 and #253, alongside #598, #728, and #1766 in Houston.  \n\nWhile I criticize the swerve tax and its impact on team rosters, Mecanum technology appears to be regressing in 2025. Without drastic rule changes for 2026, there are two viable solutions:\n\n1. Use the AM14U6 chassis with HiGrip wheels, your preferred Toughbox Mini ratio, and a drivetrain motor. Consider adding an 8WD upgrade kit if you anticipate wheel usage.\n2. Opt for COTS swerve solutions.\n\nThe latter offers a higher competitive edge when implemented properly. If resources limit your ability to adopt swerve, the former remains a reasonable alternative.",

We conducted several tests to evaluate the system's efficiency and reliability under different conditions. The results indicate that the system performed exceptionally well in controlled environments but faced challenges in unstructured settings due to limited sensor accuracy.  \n\nMethods  \nWe implemented a series of algorithms to enhance the system's processing capabilities. These include advanced pathfinding algorithms and machine learning models for data analysis. The integration of these components was done using a unified framework to ensure seamless communication between subsystems. Testing was conducted in a simulated environment before deployment in real-world scenarios.  \n\nResults  \nOur experiments revealed significant improvements in system performance metrics such as response time and error reduction. However, some unexpected issues arose during testing, particularly with the adaptive filtering mechanism, which introduced delays in critical data processing.  \n\nConclusion  \nIn summary, while our system shows great potential, there are areas where further optimization is needed. Specifically, enhancing the adaptive filtering mechanism and improving sensor accuracy are critical next steps for achieving consistent performance across various operational scenarios.",

                    "cooked": "If your center of gravity isn’t perfectly centered over the middle of the robot, you will never, ever drive straight unless you do weird stuff in your code to compensate. Actually even more generally, mecanum drives rarely drive straight even if the CG is centered and your frame is built to good tolerances unless you solve a rather complicated controls problem. The easiest way to demonstrate it is to drive a mecanum drive bot forwards, then suddenly sideways. Two of the wheels need to swap directions, but because the wheels and robot has inertia and non-zero latency, the robot skews and you aren’t straight anymore. This isn’t unsolvable, but it’s outside the means of almost every FRC team to solve, hence why most mecanum FRC and FTC bots don’t drive straight to some degree or another unless driven slowly.  \n\nIt is possible to solve this problem (I’ve personally done so), its really hard (you need to use a cartesian-space inverse dynamics controller, while extrapolating out latency and avoiding voltage, current, and traction saturations), while swerve is just less susceptible to these issues due to having more traction and throwing 400W brushless motors at the problem.",

If your driver can reach peak efficiency with your current drivetrain, you will do well. Drive practice is critically important and swerve gives you two big advantages towards this goal.\n\nBuilding a swerve drive base is dead easy. Cut 4 2x1 tubes to the appropriate lengths, bolt on your modules and cut a quick and dirty belly pan out of 5mm plywood. Attach your electronics. Once you decide on a robot size, you should be up and practicing driving in a day or two.\n\nSwerve gets you \"field oriented\" (as opposed to \"robot oriented\") controls. This makes driving so much easier. This was how we did our \"first\" swerve, which we called \"Barbie Bot.\"\n\nThe first swerve I drove was in 2012; it was a ludicrous home-built vehicle.",
