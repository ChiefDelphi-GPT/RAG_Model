                    "cooked": "Our team has been using Rev MaxSwerve the past two years, and one thing that is frequently an issue is the Neo 550s killing themselves and the spark max too. According to this post the encoder wires run up through the coils of the motor, and when the coils get too hot, it melts the insulation of the encoder wires (the insulation is PVC according to the guy I talked to at the rev table at champs) and shorts, sending the full 12 volts down the encoder wire and permanently destroying the SparkMax.\n\nI talked with the people at the Rev table this past weekend and they explained that for some reason the Neo 550 has been having trouble listening to the smart current limits, which is one of the causes of the overheating issue. Their suggestion was to use the SparkFlex with the spark flex dock , because the dock has a built in failsafe which will prevent the motor controller from being murdered by a 550. While this information is helpful, it is a lot more expensive to use SparkFlexes and the dock than it is to just use a sparkmax. If there was any solution that would allow for using a sparkmax without having to worry about the 550 murdering it, we would greatly prefer to use that. One idea that we had that we will look into is using the onboard temperature sensor in the 550 to read temperature and if the temperature exceeds a certain value for more than a second, it would shut the motor off (set input voltage to 0) until the temperature has dropped back into the normal range. I asked about this method at the rev table and they said it was certainly possible however they warned that the temperature sensors in the NEO 1.1 and NEO 550 have a certain amount of latency, so this method might not be able to detect it before it’s too late. It might be possible to use the rate of change of the temperature sensor and the measurement latency to predict what it might be at the current moment, or lower the amount of time of detection required to trigger the shutdown. Have any other teams come up with ideas or found solutions?",

For example, (fake numbers) the sensor says 100° and the wire melts at 120°, but it already melted because the windings are actually at 150°.  Instead, you’d have to set your cutoff point at, say, 60° to be safe.",
