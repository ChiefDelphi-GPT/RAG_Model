                    "cooked": "Hello all,\n\nWe were having issues today with our Arducam OV9281 running PhotonVision for pose estimation on our robot. We were unsure of the coordinate system until we noticed the marked axis on the Pigeon, which shows that we have our positive x to the right of the robot and positive y to the front of the robot (pigeon calibration set the yaw to ~ -90 degrees)\n\nimage 1920×2560 291 KB\n\nimage 1920×2560 291 KB\n\nimage 1920×2560 291 KB\n\nAlthough the pigeon calibration sets the yaw to -90 degrees, we figured out (after 5 hours of trial and error) that the coordinates of the camera were still positive x to the right of the robot and positive y to the front of the robot. In order to find the position of our camera relative to the center of the robot (pigeon), we modeled the arducam then measured to the lens of the camera (also, are you supposed to measure to the lens or where the camera gets mounted?). Therefore, we set the x to -2.4 and and the y to 13, which were taken from the CAD:\n\nWe also found the z height (from the ground) was 9.2 (also taken from the CAD).\n\nThe camera is angled upwards by 10 degrees ( image 487×613 31.7 KB ) and is angled facing 55 degrees to the left ( image 702×694 48.7 KB )\n\nimage 487×613 31.7 KB\n\nimage 487×613 31.7 KB\n\nimage 702×694 48.7 KB\n\nimage 702×694 48.7 KB\n\nTherefore, we set our Pitch to -10 and Yaw to -55.\n\nWhen put in front of an apriltag (reef ID 22, blue alliance in our case) with these transformations, the robot thinks it is to the left of where it truly is.\n\nHere is the estimated pose in advantagescope: image 1920×2560 255 KB\n\nimage 1920×2560 255 KB\n\nimage 1920×2560 255 KB\n\nHere is the actual pose: image 1920×2560 451 KB\n\nimage 1920×2560 451 KB\n\nimage 1920×2560 451 KB\n\nWe wanted to use vision for auto alignment this year and so we want the estimated pose to be as accurate as possible to the actual pose. We tried moving the y and x independently but doing so moves the robot diagonally (so it moves the estimated pose to the right but also into the reef). We were wondering if there were any issues with the way we are applying our transformations or our calibrations since we have struggled with the coordinate system for the past couple of hours.\n\nHere is a link to our code: 2025/src/main/java/frc/robot/Subsystems/Vision.java at main · frc4123/2025 · GitHub\n\nThe transformation values are in our constants, but here it is as well:\n\n//Front Angled Camera Translation and Angle\n\n}",

Also, OnShape (and potentially other CAD software)'s coordinate system is different from that expected by WPILib/Photonvision.\n\nIt is my understanding, based on the PhotonVision and WPILib documentations that the correct setup for a camera is:\n\nwhere cameraForwardOffset is how many meters forward the lens of the camera is compared to the center of the robot, etc etc. Also see this page: https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/basic-programming/coordinate-system.html , for your reference.\n\nIn your case, I would guess, assuming your camera is facing forward:\n\nx = cameraForwardOffset = 13.098 * 0.0254\n\ny = cameraLeftOffset = 2.404 * 0.0254 (positive, because the camera is left relative to the center of your robot)\n\nz = cameraUpOffset = 9.2 * 0.0254\n\nAs for the components of the Rotation3d , please take what I say with a grain of salt. The cameras on our robot are not as angled as yours, so I may be wrong. Since Rotation3d is counterclockwise (important! see WPILib API Reference ), I believe your constants should be:\n\ncameraRollRadians = 0\n\ncameraPitchRadians = 10 * pi / 180\n\ncameraYawRadians = 55 * pi / 180\n\nLooking from on top, rotated 55 degrees to the left means being 55 degree counterclockwise , and positive values for pitch means pitch up.\n\nEdit: I saw your height from the ground is 9.2 inches, in that case, the z should be whatever 9.2 inches is in meters.",

We have considered some of the points you mentioned and a lot of our concerns regarding the way we are applying things stem from our limited understanding.\n\nAlthough the pigeon is calibrated to make the forward of our robot forward for swerve drive (as imaged in the original post), our Pigeon’s mounting sets positive x to the right and positive y to the front, so the negative signs in our translations are actually correct for our configuration.\n\nRegarding rotations, we did try switching to positive values per the documentation, but that caused our robot’s estimated pose to face the wrong direction (even ending up inside the reef), which is why we ended up using negative values that seemed to work (as seen in the images as well). This discrepancy makes us wonder if something else in our transformation chain is off (and we had tried the positive x and y offsets before we found out that the pigeon mounting changed our coordinate system).\n\nThanks again for your help, and especially with the clarification about the measurement to the lens.",
