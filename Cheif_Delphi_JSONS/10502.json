This year was our first as an Ri3D team (Big Sky Robotics). We found great success with our goals for the 3-day build as well as our online presence and documentation. Moving into the off-season, we wanted to find projects that would keep us busy and provide ample learning and teaching opportunities. We decided on designing a differential swerve module for a few reasons:\n\nWe have many resources and experienced members and wanted to use these to benefit the FIRST community.\n\nWe have many resources and experienced members and wanted to use these to benefit the FIRST community.\n\nThe level of competition has risen significantly over the last couple of years (with swerve drives making a significant contribution to this).

Here is the google drive link for the CAD, renders, and videos of the Helios module.\n\nGoogle Drive Link: Helios Videos, Images, and CAD\n\nNow for some review… If you are familiar with the swerve drive terms “Differential” and “Coaxial”, the basic mechanics of most differential swerve drives, and the theoretical competitive advantage of differential swerve, then you do not need to read this section and can jump to the next section.\n\nFor this explanation, we’ll assume that you are familiar with the concept and mechanisms behind a Coaxial swerve drive. Unlike a Coaxial swerve’s 2 motors (1 for drive and 1 for steering) , a Differential swerve has 2 motors that are used to both drive and steer. This is similar to how your car’s differential allows your rear tires to spin at different speeds. For a visualization of how this differential is created and used, this is the best video that I have seen. [ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1XtXkTUXsI ]\n\nThere are multiple ways to create this differential. A common example is to have spur gears sandwiching bevel gears (as seen in the demonstration video above), which is a great and common method for FTC. This method is not often seen in FRC due to ground clearance constraints. A common method of creating a differential in FRC is to have two large independently driven ring gears (with internal gear profiles as well) that have a chain of 4 spur gears inside that bridge from the top ring gear to the bottom ring gear (as seen in Reasonable(?) Differential Swerve ). The inner 4 gears or “gear bridge” creates a mechanical connection between the two driven ring gears that restricts both ring gears to spin in opposite directions. If the two ring gears spin the same direction, the inner gear bridge binds and does not allow the outer ring gears to rotate. By driving each of the ring gears in opposite directions, power is transmitted through the gear bridge and the wheel is powered using a shaft and bevel gears from the gear bridge.\n\nSo how does the module steer? Putting this differential in the context of the entire module, the two ring gears sit in bearings just above the wheel. When the outer gears both turn the same direction, the inner gear bridge locks (and the wheel does not drive). Once locked, everything inside the ring gears can be treated as a rigid assembly. Accordingly, each motor will apply a net torque on the assembly that causes it to rotate and “steer” the wheel.\n\nWe highly recommend reviewing the images in the Reasonable(?) Differential Swerve post above to help with visualizing this explanation. Now that we understand how the opposite spinning of module ring gears causes the wheel to drive without steering, and the ring gears spinning together causes the wheel to steer without driving, one can see how a variable ratio of the ring gears’ velocities could result in the wheel both driving and steering. The speed at which the module drives and steers is dependent on the relative angular velocity between the outer gears.\n\nOne final note , the competitive advantage that a Differential Swerve drive offers over a Coaxial is additional motor power. With the Differential, 8 motors are available for gearing with sprint distances and floor speeds rather than 4. Even though twice the amount of motors means twice the theoretically available power, it does not mean twice the performance. Although debated, the major limiting factor for a differential swerve is current draw.\n\nBefore diving into the design of the Helios Module, we want to acknowledge the many differential and coaxial swerve drives that we used as inspiration, points of learning, and reference. A brief list of references and inspiration will be at the end of this section.\n\nDrive Ratios and Test Plan We currently have Helios’ drive ratio at 5.6:1 with an adjusted floor speed of 15.2 ft/s and the steer ratio is currently at 8.4:1. Much research was put in to deciding on these ratios and in that process the wide spectrum of opinions on the “ideal/best” ratios became evident. In hope to lead to an empirical discussion of ratios and differential swerve as a whole, our module is hot-swappable for the drive and steer ratio. The adjustable drive ratio range is: 3.9:1 - 5.6:1 and the steer ratio range is: 7:1 - 8.4:1. We are initially gearing on the slowest end of those ratios and hope to conduct multiple empirical tests against coaxial swerve drives and various ratios. Kinematic, current, and voltage data will all be collected during these tests which will allow for the comparison of Differential Swerve field performance over Coaxial as well as the observation of current draw and brownout limitations. We will post a follow up with more information after we have been able to conduct these tests.\n\nHelios Details and CAD Angled_wheel_angled_view_2 1920×1080 71.8 KB\n\nAngled_wheel_angled_view_2 1920×1080 71.8 KB\n\nAngled_wheel_angled_view_2 1920×1080 71.8 KB\n\nAngled_wheel_angled_view_3 1920×1080 71.8 KB\n\nAngled_wheel_angled_view_3 1920×1080 71.8 KB\n\nAngled_wheel_angled_view_3 1920×1080 71.8 KB\n\nThe Helios module was designed in 3 subassemblies starting with our initial whiteboard drawings and all the way through through 4 iterations of CAD and design reviews. Our v4 CAD files are in the linked google drive if anyone wants a deep dive into the inner workings of the Helios module. The “000_” top level module assembly contains the “100_” structural assembly, the “200_” differential assembly, and the “300_” wheel assembly. The 100 assembly is bolted to the chassis similarly to an SDS MK4i, the 300 level assembly can be removed with 4 bolts on the wheel forks, and then the 200 level assembly can be removed with 3 bolts on the top encoder plate. This means our module can be separated into its 3 sub assemblies with the removal of 7 bolts, allowing for easy maintenance, troubleshooting, and gear ratio configuration. See the animation below for a rendering of this process.\n\nMany differential swerve modules use 4 spur gears in between 2 large ring gears (again see the images in the Reasonable(?) Differential Swerve post for reference) to create the differential between the motors. However, we decided to shift this “gear bridge” down to and through the wheel. This is done by 2 pinions on the inner ring gears that power a bevel gear on the wheel (see the cross section below). The wheel is powered on each side by each motor with the gear train and bevel gears. This creates the same differential between the motors and we found it would reduce complexity and provide more favorable loading schemes. In our preliminary research and design phase, we conducted gear stress analyses on each interaction with the laser cut ring gears. We found that the stresses were no higher than typical FRC loading situations that we were accustomed to and thus gave us confidence in our material and manufacturing choices with the laser cut ring gears.\n\nDiffSection1 752×948 76 KB\n\nDiffSection1 752×948 76 KB\n\nDiffSection1 752×948 76 KB\n\nWe have worked to incorporate many lessons learned and intuitive features in the Helios module to aid both maintenance and competition feasibility/durability. These lessons learned are both from FRC teams’ experience with maintaining and running swerve modules in competition as well as from our 4 CAD iterations, design reviews, and our prototype module. By no means do we expect this module to be without issue, but we hope that the research, initial testing, and iteration that we have put into it will result in a functional and durable design that will lead to future learning and iteration. We are currently machining 4 Helios modules to build a full chassis in the fall and begin conducting our tests over the course of the next semester.\n\nReferences:\n\nSDS MK4i, Flipped Motor, Corner Biased, Swerve Module\n\nReasonable(?)

We are using a Linear–quadratic regulator (LQR) based on inputs from a Kalman Filter, the schema Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) to make simulation easy along with Advantage Scope Logging, and we are using odometry and module optimization from FRC team 3663. If you have additional resources that your team has used for Differential Swerve programming we would love to see.\n\nSources:\n\nTeam 5687’s code\n\nPaper by Declan Freeman-Gleason\n\nTeam 3663’s code\n\nPrototype and Testing We finished our v3 Helios CAD and design review with about a month until the end of the semester. We felt good about the design but knew that we wanted to build 1 module before we made drawings and got ready to machine them over the summer. We decided to make a quick prototype module with mostly 3D printed parts. We assembled the module and began testing our code and tuning. We learned a lot through the manufacturing and assembly of the v3 prototype module which led to a final v4 iteration before the end of the semester. Our initial testing and tuning of the prototype module went well and we were able to run the 3D printed module at around 30-50% power and gain stable, although currently slow, control over the module’s position and velocity.\n\n(Please see the full video included in the google drive link at the top of the post)\n\nWe are not done testing and tuning as we work to improve the performance, work out bugs, and continue to tune. We are continuing to tune our Helios prototype module this summer and aim to increase the responsiveness of the azimuth angle while maintaining (and improving) stable control. Again, we will update this thread and/or the google drive linked above with new photos and videos regarding our progress.\n\nPlease feel free to ask any questions!",

Well done!\n\nI’ve always been leery about the steering gear ratio for diff swerves.   8.4:1 is a lot faster than a typical swerve steer ratio (SDS is more like 20:1).  My intuition is that a twitchy steering setup will make control more difficult, and force you to reserve more torque from the drive motors to keep the steering stable.   I’m looking forward to what your simulations show.",

We found that the stresses were no higher than typical FRC loading situations that we were accustomed to and thus gave us confidence in our material and manufacturing choices with the laser cut ring gears.\n\nHow did you get around the focal spread issues when laser cutting gears?\n\nLaserFocalPosition 1026×541 81.8 KB\n\nLaserFocalPosition 1026×541 81.8 KB\n\nLaserFocalPosition 1026×541 81.8 KB\n\nI’ve looked into doing differential swerves for the past year or so, but basically gave up on the idea due to limited (and expensive) COTS internal gear options and our inability to manufacture them ourselves through CNC Mill, Waterjet, or (presumably) laser, because of the tolerances typically required for spur gears. I basically figured we’d need to find a sponsor that either did dedicated gear manufacturing or had a wire EDM machine (neither of which appear to be common in our area).",

                    "cooked": "We also used both waterjet cut as well as laser cut 20DP gears for our main module rotation for our custom swerve for many years without an issue. Some of those modules had well over 100 FRC matches on them along with extensive driver practice, tuning, and demo time on them.\n\nGranted, the module rotation gears never really operate at particularly high speed. But, based on my calculations, the gear loads are at least as high as the wheel rotation gear loads, perhaps even higher in some cases. We never used grease on this particular mesh. The driving gear was also aluminum (COTS).\n\nWe would put the gears in a tumbler after cutting to de-bur them (the laser cutting would produce burrs) and then generally run-in the gears a bit just to make sure that the contact surfaces were reasonably smooth. But we did not do any lapping or anything more extensive than a few minutes of running at decent speed and light load.\n\nI would think that with only slightly more effort, gears that you cut yourself would be just fine for a higher speed application like this.",

                    "cooked": "Thanks for all the feedback and comments! We are aware of the risks and uncertainties that are associated with venturing out into Differential Swerve in this way. But that is part of what makes it fun and challenging, as we navigate pushing the boundary of the technology and hope to learn a lot from this module in order to improve on it and hopefully make it easier for other teams to venture into.\n\n2 things that seemed to come up:\n\nLaser cut ring gears. This is not an ideal manufacturing method and I don’t think I would personally recommend any team to use laser cut gears during a competition season. However, I do think that they will allow us to test our modules with some level of rigor. I have heard anecdotally from, several teams that waterjet cut gears have functioned well in competition. Our preference was to use waterjet cut gears, however, our circumstances and time constraints dictated that laser cut gears would get us working modules sooner. If any problems arise with the laser cut gears we will have to reach out to local connections and try to get them waterjet cut.\n\nLaser cut ring gears.

I do agree that it is not common or easy to run a swerve module with such a low steer ratio. However, while doing research on previous differential swerve modules, I came across a couple examples of teams pulling it off. As we are currently tuning our prototype module, I don’t have concrete answers on how to achieve perfect steering control with our low ratio. We are working with some professors at our university to better understand our code and more effectively narrow down on a solution. If any teams have worked on a similar issue before using an LQR and Kalman filter, I would be curious to know how you went about tuning it!\n\nAggressive Steer ratio.
