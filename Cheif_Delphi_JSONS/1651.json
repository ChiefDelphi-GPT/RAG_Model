                    "cooked": "Welcome to Team 1678’s SystemCore Alpha Test thread! As one of the teams selected for the first wave of SystemCore alpha testing, we are honored to be able to share our thoughts/ experiences with the new robot controller to the general public!\n\nFor this project, we chose to install the SystemCore on “Omega” which is our carbon copy of our competition robot that competed at the FIRST World Championship in Houston this past April, as well as being our practice bot. We intentionally chose this robot for a couple of reasons:\n\nWe wanted to be able to do a direct comparison between the roboRIO and the SystemCore. For this we wanted the robot to be as close to identical to our competition robot as possible to reduce external variables.\n\nIn order to compete with it at off-season competitions, we wanted to put it on one of the two identical robots so that we could test the controller while still being as competitive as we would be normally.\n\nIt was easy to transfer to the wiring and placement of the SystemCore because the placement of the roboRIO that was already on the robot was very accessible, and it helped to have an already fully functional robot on which we knew all of the systems well beforehand, so that we could more easily see which issues were caused directly by the SystemCore vs the other parts of the robot.\n\nIf the SystemCore didn’t end up working out for our first offseason competition (Chezy Champs) we would have a backup robot that was nearly identical, making our decision much less time pressured during the weeks leading up to Chezy Champs when we still weren’t sure if it would be viable to bring our Omega robot. This also made it so that we could still hold driver practice while we were debugging any issues on Omega.\n\n6/28/25\n\nWe began transferring the wiring from the roboRIO to the SystemCore. This was a fairly simple process, as many of the ports were the same or very similar. On the robot that we used, we had two CAN loops (one beginning on the roboRIO and one on the CANivore), so we moved the roboRIO CAN loop to CAN port 0 on the SystemCore, and the CANivore was plugged into one of the USB slots. The original plan was to split the robot into multiple sections and create 5 new CAN loops to fully test the capabilities of the SystemCore, however that would have taken much more time and effort including a rewire of a decent portion of the CAN on the robot, so we eventually decided against it for the sake of efficiency. Power, USB, and ethernet were all the same, so we simply plugged the wires into the appropriate ports for each.\n\n7/2/25\n\nThe new Molex PWM crimps arrived, so we began to transfer over the beam break wirings to the SystemCore. The PWM crimps and housings were the main difference in the wiring between the roboRIO and the SystemCore, as the ports for DIO, RSL , and other signal wires require different housings on the SystemCore than they do on the roboRIO. Previously, we were using the male and female PWM crimps from Hansen Hobbies with the 1x3 Latching Polarized housings (the latching parts were cut off) from the same supplier. For the SystemCore, we bought a pack of the recommended 3-pin Molex SL crimps and housings, which had noticeably better quality in comparison to what we had before, as well as being able to fit in the SystemCore ports. However, instead of buying a new Molex crimper, we used the PWM crimper from DigiKey that we already had in-shop and had been using for PWM crimps for years for the newer crimps, as it worked perfectly fine—and this way, our expenses were reduced since the Molex crimpers are quite expensive.\n\nFor our team, getting this running and competing at a competition was a long and arduous process (partly due to other robot issues).\n\n7/2/25\n\nInitially, when we got the SystemCore, the first powerup and configuration of the team number and WIFI Band was super easy due to the documentation on the Github Page. Communication on Driver Station was established easily with no issues.\n\nGetting our first program on it was a process… We continued to follow steps from “Deploying Your First Robot Program to SystemCore”.\n\nThis step had us stumped for a while. In this meeting we were unable to get anything deployed (including the Phoenix Tuner X diagnostics server) so that we could at least update CAN devices to Alpha Firmware.\n\n7/5/25\n\nWe installed the CAN packages to the SystemCore. This process was super easy and the documentation was also extremely easy to follow.\n\nsys2 751×471 97.6 KB\n\nsys2 751×471 97.6 KB\n\nsys2 751×471 97.6 KB\n\nAfter packages were downloaded, we were able to get into Phoenix Tuner and update all of our CAN devices to the 2027_alpha respective versions. This process took a long time, which we initially suspected had to do with the SystemCore. However, in retrospect we believe that it was a computer issue because in all future testing the device update process was significantly shorter.\n\n7/9/25\n\nAt this meeting, we tried once again to get a valid robot program on the SystemCore. We still were unable to get any motion from the robot. Quick reminder that this was the step that confused us:\n\nWe thought we needed to create it THROUGH WPILib VSCode. Hence, we tried to create a new project through WPILib VSCode. However, none of the options led to any motion. We decided to consult the other alpha tester teams to see if they had any insight. We consulted 6328’s Chief Delphi Post/Github where they posted videos of their robot driving. We decided to try and use their public SystemCore base code to try to at least get ours to move. This did not work for us. At this point, after trying to create a new project from WPilib VSCode again, we decided that we should just try the way we have done in the past: generating the base via Phoenix Tuner X. After generation, we opened it in the 2027_Alpha Version of VS Code so that we could use the quick import tool to get a swerve drivebase running ASAP. This ended up working out pretty well, and we were able to get the SystemCore robot moving!\n\n7/12/25\n\nIn preparation for this meeting, we imported C2025 (Our competition robot code base) into the 2027 VS Code version and began the excruciating process of updating API Calls manually.\n\nAlong with the installation of the SystemCore, Omega was retrofitted so that its mechanisms were on par with Comp’s. However, once we deployed this new code base to Omega for the first time, the SystemCore began to crash repeatedly. After going back through the stack trace, we were able to trace the issue to one line in Robot.Java:\n\nRobotController is a class that “Contains functions for roboRIO functionality”. The alternative is currently not available. Since this was a roboRIO specific API Call, Java was crashing because it had no idea what we were referencing. For some insight into why we use this, this allows us to lower at what voltage brownout protections kick in. Although this is not on the SystemCore yet, we are hopeful that either a call like this is added so we can lower the threshold or another solution is implemented so that our brownouts kick in later.\n\nThat issue took a while to solve; after that the rest of the meeting was spent on the bring-up of the robot as normal. The SystemCore functioned great during this time and had no further issues.\n\n7/16/25\n\nThis meeting was the continuation of bring-up. However, this was also the point in time when we began to encounter our first major issue with the SystemCore device. Upon powering on, the screen was completely shut off with no display (power cycling the robot did nothing to fix this). Yet, all other functionality of the robot was completely fine, and the shut-off screen seemed to have no effect on the functionality of the device itself.\n\nsys4 1200×1600 187 KB\n\nsys4 1200×1600 187 KB\n\nsys4 1200×1600 187 KB\n\n7/20/25\n\nOn this day, when we turned on Omega in the morning, it booted right up and the screen was on. So the screen issue confused us for a bit, and it kept having issues till we updated to a newer OS version at a later time.\n\nsys5 540×720 54.7 KB\n\nsys5 540×720 54.7 KB\n\nsys5 540×720 54.7 KB\n\nFurthermore, on this day, we began to wrap up the bring-up process. All the functionally that was left to test were all our Digital Inputs. This ended up taking a lot longer than we anticipated. We almost immediately ran into an issue, which was that several of the ports that we originally chose to plug our beam breaks and other PWM -based components into didn’t receive any signal at all. This was quite difficult to initially diagnose, as it was hard to distinguish between a SystemCore issue and what could have been an electrical or connection issue. Initially, the button that we had installed (when pressed, switches all of the motors on the robot between brake and coast, making it easier to move mechanisms when the robot is disabled but on—see C2025 for more info) and our coral end effector beam break both received no signal. Our solution to this (after confirming that the wiring was correct and they were plugged in well) was to change the ports of the components that weren’t working, and after some numerous trials/ shuffling of all 4 PWM devices we eventually found a solution. These were our port assignments:\n\nName Initial Port Assignment Final (Working) Port Assignment Algae End Effector Beam Break 0 0 Coral End Effector Beam Break 1 5 Indexer Beam Break 2 2 Button 3 4*\n\n*The button still doesn’t work on port 4. Although this could very well be an issue with wiring or with the button itself, we have attempted several fixes to remedy this issue (including trying a brand-new button and re-crimping the connections to the SystemCore) with no success, leading us to believe that both ports 3 and 4 are non-functional, in addition to the port that the coral end effector beam break was in, 1.\n\n7/23/25\n\nIn addition to finishing the bring-up process of everything and doing a bunch of validation, this meeting was spent trying to figure out what was wrong with all of our scoring. For context, all of our scoring is done on one controller through paddles on the back of the controller. The paddles are bound to the D-pad buttons. When we tried to run any autoscore, the robot would charge at the driver station wall. After a lot of log tracing, we realized that the issue was with the D-pad mappings from the 2027 Alpha 1. However, just as we were about to post, WPILib Alpha 2 was released which patched this issue.\n\n7/26/25\n\nWith the patch for the D-pad issues fixed, we overhauled our controls for the D-pad so that they worked with the new API. After that, all our scoring worked perfectly with no issues. We spent this meeting working on a lot of validation and testing. We also began to attempt to run driver practice on the robot so we could find additional issues. Moreover to put hours on Omega before Chezy Champs in September. Unfortunately, we began to encounter issues fairly quickly (see Example 1 below).\n\n7/30/25\n\nOne of the last things to do on this robot was to get our LEDs working. For some context, we have been using Phoenix 5 on our LED software for the last few years. With the SystemCore not supporting Phoenix 5 at the moment (there are talks in the Github about future support), we were forced to try and migrate all of our LED logic to Phoenix 6. This took a while because our LEDs are fairly embedded and also customized significantly. Nevertheless, we were able to get it working in a usable capacity.\n\n8/3/25\n\nThis is when our largest issue with the robot was first noticed—the omega swerve issue. We began troubleshooting every possible cause that we could think of. At around this point, while attempting to solve the issues, we upgraded our SystemCore operating system to the stable version available (Alpha 3 at this point).\n\n8/6/25 to 8/22/25\n\nThis period was spent purely on trying to solve the Omega swerve issue. See the below section for context and how we solved it.\n\n8/23/25 to 8/25/25\n\nOnce the Omega swerve issue was solved, these days were basically spent on fixing mechanical issues on the robot along with trying to get as many hours of driver practice on the robot as possible. Before these days, this robot has less than 6 hours on it since being retrofitted in June due to the Omega swerve issues. On 8/25 we also encountered the extremely dangerous disconnection issue (see Github Post for more info). We did not have a chance to post it before someone else did due to the chaos that was getting packed for Chezy (the next day).\n\nOne of the main issues that we ran into while running the SystemCore was that diagnosing issues became much harder because we were often unsure if something was a SystemCore bug or simply an issue on our end from software, electrical, or mechanical.\n\nExample: Omega swerve (8/6/25-8/22/25)\n\nAlmost as soon as we got our Omega robot up and running with the SystemCore, we discovered a major issue during driver practice that involved momentary loss of the back left swerve module. Refer to this document to see the lengthy process that we went through to eventually find the issue (which was found to be a faulty MPM port that the CANcoder was plugged into).\n\nIssue: Faulty PWM Ports See 7/20/25\n\nIssue: Faulty PWM Ports\n\nSee 7/20/25\n\nIssue: Internal Storage Full on SystemCore Problem: The SystemCore was logging all its logs to its internal storage rather than to an external USB thumb drive that was plugged in Effect: This led to at Chezy, logs cutting out partially through the match, and also the robot was sluggish and also the robot overall just did not work during a match Fix: Cleared the Internal storage on the SystemCore using “sudo rm -rf *” in the terminal in browser Recommendations Warnings put to console when internal storage exceeds 90% full SystemCore auto deletes the logs starting with oldest when internal storage is greater than 95% full until it is less than 90% to maintain functionality\n\nIssue: Internal Storage Full on SystemCore\n\nProblem: The SystemCore was logging all its logs to its internal storage rather than to an external USB thumb drive that was plugged in\n\nEffect: This led to at Chezy, logs cutting out partially through the match, and also the robot was sluggish and also the robot overall just did not work during a match\n\nFix: Cleared the Internal storage on the SystemCore using “sudo rm -rf *” in the terminal in browser\n\nRecommendations Warnings put to console when internal storage exceeds 90% full SystemCore auto deletes the logs starting with oldest when internal storage is greater than 95% full until it is less than 90% to maintain functionality\n\nWarnings put to console when internal storage exceeds 90% full\n\nSystemCore auto deletes the logs starting with oldest when internal storage is greater than 95% full until it is less than 90% to maintain functionality\n\nIssue: Robot kept last input when Driver Station disconnected This seems to have been root caused already by the SystemCore team\n\nIssue: Robot kept last input when Driver Station disconnected\n\nThis seems to have been root caused already by the SystemCore team\n\nLikes\n\nThe SystemCore boots super fast It’s quicker and easier than ever to restart robot code or power cycle\n\nIt’s quicker and easier than ever to restart robot code or power cycle\n\nThe Screen Having access to some basic debug information super easily is helping in initial debug steps\n\nHaving access to some basic debug information super easily is helping in initial debug steps\n\nWiring Very similar to roboRIO so it wasn’t difficult to figure out how to wire it\n\nVery similar to roboRIO so it wasn’t difficult to figure out how to wire it\n\nDislikes\n\nLack of a Replacement for RobotController.java Hopefully this is added soon, but away to manually configure things like BrownoutVoltage would be extremely helpful\n\nHopefully this is added soon, but away to manually configure things like BrownoutVoltage would be extremely helpful\n\nWay to use an external USB drive for logs We used the way that we did on the RIO and that did not work.

If there is a new way that we don’t know about please let us know!\n\nMaybe I missed it but did you check the WebUI to see if your USB drive was recognized by SystemCore?  If it isn’t there (or you can check via command line) then you are likely running into this issue , and should just try a different USB drive for now.\n\nWhat OS release are you on?  If you are on 167 which has been “released” for a while but is in a rough state so would highly recommend not using that and it was recently marked so.",

Although this could very well be an issue with wiring or with the button itself, we have attempted several fixes to remedy this issue (including trying a brand-new button and re-crimping the connections to the SystemCore) with no success, leading us to believe that both ports 3 and 4 are non-functional, in addition to the port that the coral end effector beam break was in, 1.\n\nHow are these devices wired (both the button and the beam breaks)? Systemcore alpha units have a 4.7kOhm pull- down resistor on each smart io pin, which is different from the roborio which has a 40kOhm pull- up resistor on each DIO pin. This means that you must either add a stronger pull-up resistor to counter the pull down or wire the device to connect the signal pin to +3.3v instead of ground.",

And follow-up question: if that is what’s going on, why would the other beam breaks work (and the coral end effector beam break work when we moved it to a different port)?\n\nAs for the button, we use this , I believe it’s wired using the PWM wire that comes with it going directly to the SystemCore port.\n\nRyan_Blue:\n\nSystemcore alpha units have a 4.7kOhm pull- down resistor on each smart io pin, which is different from the roborio which has a 40kOhm pull- up resistor on each DIO pin. This means that you must either add a stronger pull-up resistor to counter the pull down or wire the device to connect the signal pin to +3.3v instead of ground.\n\nI will definitely look into this. For implementing a pull-up resistor (especially on the button), would it just be a resistor (greater than 4.7kOhms) spliced between the power and signal wires?\n\nThank you so much for the information, this is definitely going to help us a lot in solving this issue!",

I’m assuming the sensor has a PNP output (sensor connects the output to +10v when active, leaves it floating otherwise). The 4.7k pull down resistor changes the effective ratio of the voltage divider (low side resistance should be ~1.13k) but not significantly- the output should be ~4.3v.\n\nSarahOH:\n\nIf I’m understanding correctly, is the idea that it wasn’t working properly basically because the signal connects to ground instead of 3.3V (and therefore the pull-down resistor isn’t being overpowered)?\n\nYep- I think you’ve got the idea. Many sensors in FRC have NPN outputs, which connect signal to ground when active (and leave it floating otherwise). These types of sensors aren’t useful without a pull up resistor (normally provided by the roborio), as they need the inactive state of the signal pin to be high.\n\nSince it doesn’t appear to be an issue with pull configuration, I’d highly recommend making an issue on the alpha testing repository - this will make sure the info is seen by the right eyes that can help diagnose further.\n\nSarahOH:\n\nAs for the button, we use this\n\nSarahOH:\n\nFor implementing a pull-up resistor (especially on the button), would it just be a resistor (greater than 4.7kOhms) spliced between the power and signal wires?\n\nYep- a pull up resistor can be implemented as you described, though the resistance needs to be less than 4.7k: the output of the voltage divider formed by the pull-up and pull-down resistors needs to be greater than ~2.25v (the input high voltage according to the systemcore specification document). As you’ve probably guessed, the button likely isn’t working because it connects the black and white wires, and you have the black wire connected to ground.\n\nAlternatively, you could rewire the button such that it switches +3.3v instead of ground- connect the black wire to +3.3v (and of course leave white connected to the signal pin).",

                    "cooked": "First of all, thank you SO much for explaining all of this, it’s super helpful both for myself to have a better understanding of how all of this works and for our team, so that we can implement practices like this in the future.\n\nRyan_Blue:\n\nI believe this configuration should have worked. I’m assuming the sensor has a PNP output (sensor connects the output to +10v when active, leaves it floating otherwise).\n\nYep, checking the product description of the beam break we use looks like it can be wired either way (PNP or NPN), so we just have it wired for PNP.\n\nRyan_Blue:\n\nSince it doesn’t appear to be an issue with pull configuration, I’d highly recommend making an issue on the alpha testing repository\n\nI’ll definitely work on getting this posted ASAP, thanks!\n\nRyan_Blue:\n\nAlternatively, you could rewire the button such that it switches +3.3v instead of ground- connect the black wire to +3.3v (and of course leave white connected to the signal pin).\n\nI will implement this tomorrow, hopefully that will fix our issue! I will also definitely keep in mind the pull up resistor as an option; even if we don’t need to implement it in this case it’s definitely useful knowledge to have.\n\nRyan_Blue:\n\nMany sensors in FRC have NPN outputs, which connect signal to ground when active (and leave it floating otherwise). These types of sensors aren’t useful without a pull up resistor (normally provided by the roborio), as they need the inactive state of the signal pin to be high.\n\nOut of curiosity, do you know why SystemCore decided to implement the pull down resistor? I understand that it’s probably a more widely used system, but if most FRC sensors have NPN outputs as you said, I would assume that it would make more sense to keep it on a pull-up resistor system.\n\nEugene_Fang:\n\nThe yellow 4.7 kΩ shown here is the internal pull-down, so we added a ~1 order of magnitude lower resistance (400 Ω) resistance between signal and +3.3 V to overwhelm the internal pull-down. (3.3 * (4700 / (4700 + 400)) = ~3)\n\nThanks for the diagram, this is really beneficial for me to be able to see a visual representation of how a pull-up resistor would be wired!\n\nZaque:\n\nthey faced similar issues and solved it by reconfiguring the smart IO as an analog input and doing a simple comparison in code. Should be a usable workaround for your beam break if you can’t figure out a root cause, but your button should definitely work with the simple wiring changes suggested above.\n\nOoh, interesting. I will definitely look into that. The beam break was fixed when we moved it to a different port, but that’s a good option to keep in mind in case we run into any other issues in the future.",

If it isn’t there (or you can check via command line) then you are likely running into this issue , and should just try a different USB drive for now.\n\nI believe that it was recognized but I will verify and update tomorrow. Do you by chance know how I would check via command line?\n\njdaming:\n\nWhat OS release are you on? If you are on 167 which has been “released” for a while but is in a rough state so would highly recommend not using that and it was recently marked so.\n\nI believe we are on release 166 currently but will verify and update tomorrow on this as well.",

Whenever we’d hit a battery voltage below ~8V, the robot can barely drive.\n\nI apologize, I should have clarified how we use this. Basically, it lowers the voltage at which brownout protections kick in—even though our resting voltage doesn’t dwindle that fast, in our experience when we run all of our subsystems in parallel there were short frames where we’d see something drop below 6.3V and brownout protection would kick in and the robot would alternate between moving and brownout protection, which would create jerky movements. This is not intended to allow the robot to drive when the resting voltage is around 8 (we swap all of our batteries whenever resting <12V if possible).",
