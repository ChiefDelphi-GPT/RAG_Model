The primary one currently is that the string keeps spooling on top of itself, making the string very hard to spool when the string is tensioned, so much so that whenever the string is tensioned, our Kraken stalls trying to pull the elevator all the way down to the ground. Our elevator design consists of two motors attached to two seperate spools, pulling two seperate strings, one for each side of the elevator.\n\nOnce again, this is our first year building an elevator, and we’d appreciate any advice CD can give us. Thanks!",

For our 4.5 feet of elevator travel this year, that’s 3 to 4 inches of spool width.\n\nIf possible, run both spools off the same shaft.  This avoids one side getting ahead of the other and causing slack in a rope, which is a likely cause of tangled wraps on the spool.  We are using a single shaft with two Krakens driving it together.\n\nUse an extra spool and rope to pull the elevator back down, ideally mounted on the same drive shaft as a raising rope.  We typically include a spring on this down-rope at the top of the carriage to maintain a constant tension.  Having ropes for both up and down makes sure you don’t outrun gravity on the way down, and also keeps everything tight if you manualky raise the carriage while working on the robot.",

                    "cooked": "This is a difficult problem to solve – make no mistake about it.  What I mean is that you have to get a lot of things right for it to work properly; one incorrect thing is enough to break the design.  It is for this reason that I don’t usually recommend rope-driven elevators.\n\nIn addition to the things everyone else said:\n\nWebbing can fix the override issue, but leaves you with another problem: your effective drum diameter changes continuously as the webbing wraps, which means your control code gets more complicated.  It also might not spool repeatably (e.g., tighter/looser), which messes with your height accuracy.  That said, it’s probably the simplest way to get the elevator lifting – it might leave you with a set of problems that are easier to solve, but it’s hard to say without more info.\n\nIf you’re sticking with rope:\n\nRead about “ fleet angle ”.  It refers to the angle between the rope and the axis of the winding drum.  When this angle gets too large, your rope overrides on the drum/winch.  If you describe it in rise and run, the rise is the width of half of the the wraps on the drum and the run is the distance from the drum to your first sheave (vertically), which is hopefully most of the way to the top of your elevator.  If not, this would be the first thing to look at.  Again, photos would help.  You can probably determine the max fleet angle that works experimentally, since you already have the elevator built, then work backwards to figure out how achieve something less than that.\n\nThe winding drum diameter can help or hurt you a lot here.  The greater its  diameter, and therefore circumference, the less width you need to store the length of rope used for elevator travel, and the less your fleet angle changes over the elevator’s range.  However, the greater its circumference, the greater the required gear reduction from the motors, and the more space you need for it.\n\nThe rope diameter is also a factor in this.  If your rope is oversized now, you may be able to switch to smaller-diameter rope.  If so, you might be able to fit enough turns on your existing drum to make it work.  Since you’re using two ropes and two drums, this might be feasible.  Watch out for the greater (elastic) elongation that comes with smaller-diameter rope, though.  Its ultimate strength needs to be much greater than the simple weight of your elevator.",
