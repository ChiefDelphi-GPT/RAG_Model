Laser cutters and CNC routers help create high-fidelity prototypes\n\nBe ready to prototype with aluminum tubing.  There are lots of prototyping “blocks” available for 3D printing to let you join tubes and mount bearings, motors, and gearboxes.\n\nHave portable electronics boards or other devices ready so you can run motors at variable speed on your prototypes\n\nHave a drive base or two already assembled and runnable.  Mount prototypes on these bases to do things like test intakes\n\nHave as large a stock of parts on hand as the team can afford.  Nothing slows down prototyping more than not having parts to test and build with.  A variety of sizes of wheels, gearboxes, pneumatic cylinders, and belts are some of the most helpful items.\n\n3D print pullies and gears to test with.  Sometimes these items can even be used on the comp robot\n\nMake sure you team is dedicating enough time to development.  In the first few weeks when design and prototyping should be taking place, it is easy to think that competition is still a long way off and robotics can have lower priority.\n\nThese are just a few stream-of-consciousness thoughts.\n\nP.S. if it is possible to edit your title, you should change “Dessing” to “Design”.

If possible, get together with other teams in your area and scrimmage to learn how to interact with other robots. It may give you better results in competition to spend time practicing with your robot than spending the same amount of time to add another function to it.\n\nI re-watch these videos every year before Kickoff.",
