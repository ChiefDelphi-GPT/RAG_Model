I have helped lead the kids down the path of using YAGSL , and I just a have a few questions, and hope to get pointed into the right direction.\n\nWhen trying to strafe, the angle motors will oscillate, and eventually stop moving (not at the desired spot). I understand that this is probably just a PID issue. However, when trying to strafe, the drive motors will stop in place, and the wheels themselves will stop moving. Is there anyone who might have an understanding on what might be the issue here?\n\nWhen trying to strafe, the angle motors will oscillate, and eventually stop moving (not at the desired spot).

Is there anyone who might have an understanding on what might be the issue here?\n\nI’m 90% positive I saw this being mentioned on the YAGSL website, but I can’t find it now, and I know this is a pretty common mistake with Swerve Drive. When trying to turn, the wheels will get angled inwards to make an X shape, rather than outwards to actually spin. If someone could please point me towards that on the website, or just help here, that would be appreciated.\n\nI’m 90% positive I saw this being mentioned on the YAGSL website, but I can’t find it now, and I know this is a pretty common mistake with Swerve Drive.

Should we just convert those into degrees, or are we able to use rotations in the YAGSL swerve configuration?\n\nWhat is the best way to find CANCoder offsets given the Pheonix 6 library does not support the 360degrees and uses rotations instead?

I believe we also have to adjust that same (but different) PID for pathplanner still, but take that with a grain of salt, bc I’m not super positive. Will update on that later, once we get to doing it.\n\nAlso, we couldn’t find the CANCoder absolute encoder value in shuffleboard (we could, but it gave a string saying “number” instead of an actual number), so we just converted from rotations to degrees (rotations can be found in the Phoenix tuner app).\n\nAs for the drive motors not working when strafing, we just updated everything, and that seemed to fix the issue.",
