(If you know…       …you know)\n\nSign in to Onshape, the #1 fastest growing CAD system in the world with over 4 million users.\n\nWe would not recommend hanging the electronics from a brain pan like we did.  The shield to protect them was more than a pain in the back side.\n\nWe would recommend looking at the gripper for an excellent example of how to make a good quality ultra light weight roller system.  The gripper was exceptionally rigid and extraordinarily light weight.  There was probably some opportunity to remove even more weight from the system with more aggressive pocketing.\n\nWe would consider using the linear sliders on the extender again, but would want to be able to replace them from the outside without needing to unmount the side plates.  overall we only had two needle roller failures over the course fo the season which was much better than what we saw last year with the GreyT Telescope where we had a Bering failure every other match or so.\n\nOur CAD shows the use of Rev Ultraplanetary gearboxes on the extension and wrist joints.  We found them to be insufficiently durable for those applications, but had no issues with using them on the gripper.  We had replaced the wrist motor with a 550 driving a Versa planetary and had success with that.  Our season ended with a failure of the extension ultraplanetary gearbox.\n\nAs always our code is never hidden and available here:\n\nFRC Team 131. CHAOS 131 has 24 repositories available.

What specifically about the shield plate made this not work for 131?\n\nFrom your CAD it seems like your shield was significantly more beefy than ours - we just used a piece of 1/16th polycarbonate which we velcro’d in place.\n\nWe loved your robot as always this year - it was awesome to finally play with you all at BOTB!\n\nThanks,",

They were ripped off our robot several times.  When we went to address our CG issues after Week 1, we opted for 1/8\" steel.  The steel belly shield was held onto the robot with captive lock nuts (would use that again for semi-permanent installations such as bumpers. We needed the attachment method to be rigid enough for us be able to fly over the charge station and land on a cone without loosing the ballast.  That meant we held it on with #10-32 button head screws.  The ballast plate that was the battery box had 8 screws.  The other had 4 screws.  It was just a pain to need to use a drill to remove the cover to get at the electronics.",

To help with the explanation, I have made this Part Studio:\n\nSign in to Onshape, the #1 fastest growing CAD system in the world with over 4 million users.\n\nWe created these aluminum blocks called “Nut Holders” or “Pocket Nut Holders”.  They have holes at 0.5\" spacing between the 3 holes. For most applications 1\" would work better so it aligns with the COTS tubing spacing, but we were space constrained.\n\nimage 823×566 39.4 KB\n\nimage 823×566 39.4 KB\n\nimage 823×566 39.4 KB\n\nThe Middle hole has a receptacle for a #10-32 lock nut.  The endmill reliefs are selected to allow some lateral motion in the nut to help with assembly tolerances.  This was designed to be made with a 1/8\" endmill.   The outer holes are tapped for #10-32 Screws.\n\nHere is an example in use.  There are two basic configurations that may make sense depending on the use-case image 1034×681 116 KB\n\nimage 1034×681 116 KB\n\nimage 1034×681 116 KB\n\nThe one we use last year was the flush-mount with the plate inside the tubing.  This allowed belly plan to sit against the tubing and is more appropriate for high-load instances where a stabilizing effect between the two pieces is important. In this configuration the clamping force does not go through the Pocket Nut Holder, which probably has an advantage on longevity.\n\nThe other option is the stand-off configuration where the block is between the tubing and the removable component.  This configuration is easier to install. If I were to implement this option, I would probably make the Pocket Nut Holder a touch thicker. (5/16\" or 3/6\" total thickness rather than 1/4\")\n\nIn both cases, the threaded portion of the lock nut should point towards the removable component.\n\nWe used these for most of the season including a boat-load of offseason events.  We had them on the bot for our 2nd event.\n\n-Dan",
