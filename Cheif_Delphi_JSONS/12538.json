I don’t really know anything about computer specs and need to know what to tell the people who are going to buy them. Here’s what I’ve got so far. The laptops must have: Bluetooth capability 2+ USB ports Ethernet port Windows 10 Internet Capability\n\nBonus: HDMI port\n\nI saw a previous post asking the same question but it was from four years ago and didn’t know if times have changed. I wouldn’t be opposed to a specific laptop recommendation either.",

                    "cooked": "I’m gonna disagree with a couple things here:\n\nCPU: Get a Ryzen 5 or 7, they’re generally cheaper but are far more capable than the intel equivalent especially for multicore workloads (video editing/compiling code)\n\n16gb ram yeah, but 3200mhz is perfectly fine and significantly cheaper (ddr4, idk about ddr5)\n\nFor a gpu, anything works. Honestly, you’re probably fine with an AMD integrated graphics card, those things are flipping nuts for what they are - unless you need a decent amount of vram, you’re good with those almost for sure.\n\nGo with 500gb ssd storage, but make sure the laptop has at least an extra SATA slot in case you want to add in a cheap spinner for capacity if you’re doing a lot of video editing.\n\nWith regards to the requirements posted in OP:\n\nBluetooth capability: Any decent modern laptop will have this, especially one with the specs I just mentioned.\n\n2+ USB ports: This is getting harder to find, you do NOT want an ultrathin or 2 in 1 cause these laptops usually have few to no ports except charging.\n\nEthernet port: See above\n\nWindows 10: If you’re buying the laptop now, you will most likely have to upgrade to 10 from 11, Microsoft is forcing manufacturers to move to 11 (which is worse in every way I’ve found)\n\nInternet Capability: See bluetooth. If you can, an Intel wireless card is great, but it doesn’t really matter. Mediatek is just somewhat less reliable particularly with bluetooth.\n\nHDMI port: See ethernet/USB port point.\n\nOn the topic of manufacturers:\n\nDell/HP/Lenovo I don’t generally recommend, particularly Dell, since their laptops are already a pain to deal with in terms of software, but these laptops (less so with Lenovo) are also among the least repairable\n\nApple is good, but overpriced and cannot be repaired. There’s also the slight disadvantage that MacOS is installed and Windows is a pain to get working on the new Macs, which are the only ones I would ever recommend - Any post 2014 Intel Mac is a joke.\n\nAsus/Acer is in my experience really quite good - Asus’s casing is, in my experience, quite fragile though so you have to be careful. I’m currently writing this post on my Acer Nitro 5 (a budget gaming laptop) which I love.\n\nAs a side note, “Business”, “Professional”, and “Workstation” are labels that just mean the laptop is overpriced - I’ve seen these laptops cost around $2000 with significantly worse specs than my $1300 Acer, but used business laptops are flipping amazing - If you can get a 2018-era Dell Latitude or something, you’re set - I’d recommend the Dell Latitude e6540 if you can get them. Same goes for Thinkpads. Personal laptops imo are rarely worth it unless you need the thin and light or 2 in 1, which are things I feel can be better replaced with an iPad anyway. In general, if you’re not going used, get a budget gaming laptop from Asus or Acer, they pack a stupid amount of power, particularly the Ryzen editions, in a somewhat large form but also are really easy to work with and have cool flashy lights (Cool flashy lights is all that the label “gaming” ever means anyway, don’t let that throw you off - I’ve seen gaming laptops that can game about as effectively as a microwave on low power)\n\nTL:DR;\n\nGet a Ryzen based laptop if you can\n\nIf you can get a used business laptop, particularly a Dell Latitude or Lenovo Thinkpad, you’re set, you just need a storage and maybe RAM upgrade and you’re good\n\nDon’t get a personal laptop, get a budget gaming laptop for significantly more power at a similar price\n\nSource: Worked as a PC repair tech, was on FRC team",

All have the following specs:\n\nIntel i5 CPU (4th Gen-T440p or 6th gen-T460) 8GB RAM 128GB+ SSD Windows 10\n\nThis is still plenty for programming, though you may want more grunt for video editing, maybe up it to i7 (or equivalent AMD Ryzen 7), 16GB of RAM, and a discrete GPU. Though the i5/8GB would likely still be enough to get it done, just not be a nice experience.\n\nI agree fully on @gellnick ’s take here, new Business Machines are overpriced, but used ones are amazing! I buy slightly older (~2016-2018 currently) used/refurbished Thinkpads on E-bay for all the 3468’s needs as they are cheaper to acquire($100-150ea is usually my target for programming and general purpose), repair parts are generally easy to source (had to replace a Keyboard last year for a T440p, was very easy), they get the job done, and if something does happen to destroy a machine, the financial loss is minimal.",

OEMs main business is for businesses, and their personal machines are honestly a joke in my opinion - they’re impossible to work with in a lot of cases, particularly the thin and light ones, and repair bills are astronomical compared to business machines or particularly older gaming machines. However I have not seen a good “gaming” laptop from any of the major OEMs lately - the closest would be Lenovo’s Legion 5 Line but I’d still recommend an Asus or Acer particularly due to ease of repairability.",

Sure, they might have some integrated encoding but it’s not supported as well and quality isn’t as good.\n\nFor code editing you want a nice screen with low glare (schools have horrible lighting).\n\nAn interesting note: once you have a project in GitHub you can use the browser based VSCode GitHub has integrated. I’ve also used the cloud development environment.\n\nNice in a pinch, no wpi integration, but you can use Gradle itself to build I think.",

Ethernet port is a good one, you could make use of a Type C dongle but I have seen these come unplug before and that is rough if it is during a match.\n\nAlmost any laptop is going to perform well enough so I would focus on the features that make it comfortable to use, heck if you have a local store like microcenter just go there and feel laptops in person, sometimes something as small as a weird mousepad or awkward keyboard can make things rough.\n\nIt is possible some video rendering software will benefit from intel quicksync or nvidias encoding capabilities. AMD makes good integrated graphics but the GPU hardware encoding is still generations behind Nvidia’s latest one. I would just do some research here, probably spending extra on a dedicated GPU is not worth it.",

Definitely won’t be able to do much gaming due to this, unless it’s Minecraft or something but I don’t know if that’s a plus or not.\n\n256gb SSD is a bit small but I am admittedly a data hoarder and you can probly store everything on the cloud.\n\nWill not support Windows 11 due to CPU requirements, iirc, but that’s a plus in my book anyway.\n\nUnless you really need the gpu power though it should last the next 3-4 years quite nicely, I’ve had a lot of good experiences with older Dell business laptops.",
