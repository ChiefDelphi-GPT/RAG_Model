                    "cooked": "My team switched over to CTRE canCoders from normal mag encoders. We had 17 can devices that is now 21 devices. After the change, we are getting “CAN frame not received/too-stale”, our can utilisation is 80-100% and our tx full consistently. To ensure there is no physical electrical problem I tested the canBus incrementally and only got  “CAN frame not received/too-stale” as I reached about 90% of the whole can loop: where utilization was starting to hit 100% and TXfull started to increment. The errors got more frequent as I added the last few devices. I also inspected the Canbus and saw no physical damage. Furthermore, the overall resistance of the can loop from robo RIO to PDH is ~6 ohm for can low and can high.\n\nI was under the impression the can bus should be able to support 32 devices. I am aware, with these CanCoders we are doing a lot more costly reads on the bus but is the only solution here to decrease the number of can devices? Or is there a different underlying problem?\n\nThanks for any help.",

For some reason however, we only seem to get error -3 “Can frame not received/too-stale” only for the Cancoders which is strange considering that I’m getting and setting values for ~ 8 falcons consistently every 20 milliseconds. I think its a code issue, but I’m not sure how I could reduce the number of getting and setting of values I get over Can. Thanks!",

But, just by adding devices to your bus and using a set once per loop you shouldn’t be seeing near that.  We have more devices on the can bus than you - 23, and we reside around 70-75%.\n\nI suspect you’re doing too much in code.\n\nYou need to go through your code and methodically eliminate which area is causing the problem.  Then you can zero in on the root cause.  Whether that’s by removing references in code, or by commenting sections out.\n\nIn our case (Labview) we would put disable structures around blocks of code until the utilization dropped, then go after whatever we disabled last.",

If utilization is high, expect to see errors of this type.\n\nYou can manage bus utilization in a couple of ways – everything on the bus is using some of this resource.  Each device uses some to periodically send packets of information; most of these have settings to allow this usage to be adjusted.  The roboRIO uses this resource; you can make changes in your code to influence how much.\n\nFor most teams, it’s hard to see where the bus bandwidth is going.  This is why it can help to disable devices in your S/W and/or take them off the bus – it lets you reason about how much bandwidth each device is using so you can focus on the ones that are using the most.  You can also influence which devices do not get to send data (to an extent) by the CAN IDs you assign.  These essentially prioritize some devices ahead of others.  You can also generally do different things to help handle occasional errors of this type, in your code.\n\nIt might be helpful to list everything you have on your CAN bus and describe you code in more detail (language, what types of control are you doing, etc.).",

It oscillates from ~60-100. Even after disconnecting the cancoders(when the issue became apparent) the rest of our system still oscillated to 100%.\n\nSome tests/ data we did (each % is the max value we saw):\n\n1 falcon on can: ~7% utilization, however it was still oscillating and when we filmed the utilization on driver station in slow mo, we saw the % spike to 17% !\n\n2 different swerve units w/o cancoder: ~32 max% (same oscillating behavior)\n\neverything BUT drive base (excluding: 8 falcon 500s and 4 canCoders): 56 max% for just 9 motors! (same oscillating behavior)\n\nAgain, this was all with a blank code file.\n\nSince CAN works when Motors are powered off, i started pulling breakers to see if somehow there was EM interference somewhere but no change - just a linear decrease in utilization when devices were cut off power. However, still oscillating usage that matched our tests above.\n\nAfter seeing this troubling data we tried a robo rio 1 with older firmware and got a promising result where we saw 76% utilization for the entire robot and no crazy oscillation to 100%. Unfortunately the regulations require the newest firmware:\n\nRule update 8: ( https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2022/Manual/TeamUpdates/TeamUpdates-combined.pdf )\n\nso we updated the roboRio 1 hoping it was somehow a roboRio2 issue. But after updating - the roboRio1 also got the oscillating, high can utilization…We made sure our REV firmware and ctre devices were up to date and still no change.\n\nAt this point - I feel like we’ve figured out that all the devices are contributing to this high utilization. They are all in this spiky behavior of oscillating between a reasonable can usage to a high can usage. And how its being caused by some firmware issue and not an electrical issue…\n\nWould it be possible for you to explain more about \"You can also influence which devices do not get to send data (to an extent) by the CAN IDs you assign. \" I understand that the lower IDs might get priority but there is a way to lower data for devices?\n\nAnother datapoint is how we can see CanBus packets through the REV hardware client. Is there a way to understand those to help troubleshoot/ diagnose?\n\nThanks, sorry for delayed response.",

                    "cooked": "At any point in time, the CAN bus is either being utilized, or it is not.  So, the percent data is based on sampling and, depending on the sampling interval, is expected to be somewhat noisy (even without the issue linked above).  You are getting CAN-related errors, and you have a lot of devices – utilization is clearly an issue here.  You can use the data in the graph to track changes, by comparing this data as you perform experiments.  Also keep track of CAN errors.\n\nThis might be a good use case for a CANivore , if you are in a position to throw hardware at the problem.  This device is new, and I have zero experience with it, so I don’t want to make any promises here.  This gives you a second CAN bus, and if you put the right devices on it, it supports something called CAN-FD that should effectively give you more bus bandwidth on the second bus.\n\nOf course, be sure your CAN wiring is very solid with this number of devices (24, counting the roboRIO).  The other H/W-side option might be to take some devices off of CAN, but it looks as though that would require you to use different motors (or steering angle sensors).  I’m guessing that this isn’t an attractive option for you.\n\nThis brings it around to S/W and settings to help manage bus utilization.  It makes sense to focus on the Falcons and CANcoders. This is a description of what is going on here on the device (non-roboRIO) side.  You want to lower the rate (increase the period) for some of these periodic CAN frames being sent by the devices.  In doing this, you will want to think about what each motor is doing on your robot, if is is being followed or is a follower, how it is being controlled (on board, offboard PID, offboard voltage, etc.).  I’d bet you can drop the frame rate on many of your motors.  You might be able to cut the rate for the CANcoders in half, but I’d focus on motors initially.  If a motor controller resets (severe brownout, etc.), you’ll want to also read over this .\n\nThe other thing you can do, on the S/W side is to think about how often you are causing the roboRIO to send CAN frames to each individual motor controller.  You can try things like only updating some motor controllers every Nth itieration of the main robot loop.  Run experiments to measure the effect of S/W changes along these lines and then keep things that help and don’t hurt robot performance.\n\nI don’t know what to say about the finding on roboRIO F/W.  It could be there’s something in the area of the CAN bus utilization metric that is different.  It could also be that this is making the roboRIO use way more CAN bandwidth, but this seems like a stretch – but certainly possible.  It might be worth trying to monitor the CAN but utilization in other ways (for example, plug a USB cable in to one of the REV devices and use the REV Hardware Client to watch this).\n\nGood luck!  Let us know how things go.",

I understand that motors are sending data over can and hopefully increasing the period will fix this.\n\nUsing the rev client to see CAN, we see addresses at random sending new messages pretty frequently even with our blank code file. One of our mentors thinks that behavior is pretty normal but we aren’t sure. Do you know of any documentation that would help us decode these can messages in the rev hardware client?\n\nThanks",

We also get “Watchdog not fed” errors, and other various CAN timeout errors, even with only one talon initialized. Notably when we deploy an empty code file the TX Full errors and Watchdog not fed errors go away, but the utilization is still quite high (perhaps because of payload data).",
