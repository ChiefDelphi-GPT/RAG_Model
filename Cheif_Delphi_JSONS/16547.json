                    "cooked": "Hi all,\n\nI am a novice with electric motors and was curious how I could go about characterizing a brushed dc motor that I was planning to use for an rc lawn motor. I have two of these motors lying around without any kind of spec associated and was hoping to use them for the project. I really don’t have a speed requirement, more just enough torque to start moving and then plug along at whatever speed is possible.\n\nAt the end of the day, I’m trying to figure out what voltage to run my motor at, up to 40v (battery voltage on the lawnmower) to avoid burning it up. I also realize load and gear ratio play a big role in the current that will be drawn by the motors but I don’t know where to start to quantify this.\n\nAny expertise to help fill the gaps in my knowledge would be awesome! Thanks very much!",

At stall, a DC brushed motor is equivalent to a resistor.  Just get a multimeter and use it to measure resistance across the terminals/leads*.  I=V/R.\n\n* If making this measurement actually causes the motor to spin, you’ll have to find some way to lock the shaft.\n\n@A_Reed ’s method for finding KV looks good - put in a low voltage with no load but a tachometer of some sort, subtract the voltage drop due to resistance, and use that to get a KV value.\n\nTesting for a peak operating current is trickier, especially as you obviously don’t want to do destructive testing.  Fortunately, you have two supposedly equal motors.  I suggest that you build a mount for the motors so they have to rotate at the same speed.  You could put them face-to-face with a shaft coupler, or put them both as inputs to the same gearbox, with the same gear ratio on each motor.  On one motor, short the terminals, creating a “brake mode”.  On the other, apply a voltage you’re confident is below the maximum.  Use an IR thermometer to measure the temperature of the motor you’re driving for several minutes.  The best place to measure is going to be the output shaft (or a back shaft if it sticks out), because brushed motors generate their heat on the rotor.  Try again with increasing voltages until you find temperatures you are just barely comfortable with.  Personally, that’d be about 200°F or 95°C, your tolerance may vary.  The key thing is when you think the insulation inside the motor is or is not going to burn up [a.k.a. release the magic blue smoke].\n\nAdded later, obvously:\n\ngerthworm:\n\nFour wire resistance measurement techniques would be in order, most likely.\n\nTrue, true.
