This platform integrates seamlessly with Onshape to help teams organize, track, and manage their robot parts from CAD design to final assembly.\n\nimage 1901×905 72.8 KB\n\nimage 1901×905 72.8 KB\n\nimage 1901×905 72.8 KB\n\nFRC BOM is a web-based system that simplifies how FRC teams handle manufacturing processes by:\n\nFetching part data directly from Onshape CAD documents .\n\nAutomatically generating a full BOM with details like part names, materials, and required quantities.\n\nTracking the manufacturing process across multiple stages like CNC , Lathe , 3D Printing , and more.\n\nSupporting multiple robots for teams building multiple designs. image 1913×432 13.5 KB\n\nimage 1913×432 13.5 KB\n\nimage 1913×432 13.5 KB\n\nFetch BOM data directly from Onshape using API keys .\n\nUse our custom FeatureScript to assign manufacturing processes to each part.\n\nTrack parts through these customizable stages: Pre-Process: Initial material prep (e.g., cutting stock). Process 1: Primary operation (e.g., CNC, Lathe). Process 2: Secondary operations or finishing steps.\n\nPre-Process: Initial material prep (e.g., cutting stock).\n\nProcess 1: Primary operation (e.g., CNC, Lathe).\n\nProcess 2: Secondary operations or finishing steps.\n\nUpdate quantities and process completion with simple + and - buttons.\n\nDownload CAD Files: Export Parasolid (.x_t) files directly from Onshape. ( In the near future )\n\nAdmin Accounts: Manage team robots, parts, and processes.\n\nUser Accounts: Update part statuses and view progress.\n\nEvery Team has their passwords encrypted and the their BOM is securely locked (ONLY team 1111 can access 1111’s BOM)\n\nFilter parts by COTS , In-House , or specific processes .\n\nSee pending parts, completed parts, and ready-to-use components.\n\nUsing Onshape API’s ability to download parts from the frcbom.com site.\n\nCreating a visualizer on the frcbom site so you can see the part visualized in a 3d perspective.\n\nMaking an option to update the BOM without all qty that was already made being deleted (if you want to change an already on-going bom let me know)\n\nMaking an option to assign tasks for specific students and each student has their own frcbom account (maybe)\n\nSeeing the password while registering/logining (the eye thing) doesn’t work currently.\n\nWhen going to frcbom.com/5987 and entering an Admin account, it redirects you back to the home page (because of security stuff)\n\nI’m always open to suggestions and ideas for improving this project. If you think of a feature that could enhance the platform or notice something that could be better, chances are others might feel the same—so please don’t hesitate to share your thoughts!\n\nWhile the system has been tested extensively, no platform is ever completely bug-free. If you encounter any issues or unexpected behavior, let me know so I can work on a fix. Your feedback is invaluable!",

I’m messing around with this to consider it for our 2025 season and have a few questions/comments.\n\n“Gerung” is used as what I assume to mean “Cut.” I notice your team is from Israel, so I assume this is purely a translation thing. I’ve personally never heard the word Gerung, so I would advise changing this.\n\nMost of the raw materials you listed are great, but there are many missing. Specifically when it comes to tubing profiles from the various vendors, it can be quite important which material is selected ( WCP vs. REV tubing). There are a lot of non-standard materials that teams stock as well, like nut strips, that may be nice to add into here.\n\nEven better, it would be nice if there were a series of drop-downs that provide the relevant options. For example, the first selection can be “Type,” where you can select between sheet/plate, bar, tubing, hex, etc. Then the next drop down can select the general size or something, and then another option for the manufacturer. That’s just an example, but I am sure there are better ways to do this.\n\nI can imagine other processes as well, like welding, riveting, sanding/deburring, painting/powder coating, that would be nice to include.\n\nAs for questions: Can the BOM be imported from the top-level assembly? I saw this note in the docs and was a bit confused as to what it means: warning DO NOT FETCH IN THE “Main” SYSTEM!\n\nIf the robot BOM changes, can it be re-imported without destroying the parts/processes that are already in the system?\n\nIs the idea that all team members can log into this page to update the parts/process as they complete them?\n\nThanks for putting this together!",

I would think the word “Cut” or “Saw” would cover bandsaw and hacksaw as well.\n\nDavidMasin:\n\nIf you want I can add “Vendor” and make a FS for it.\n\nI think adding them as options in your materials FS would be better and less cumbersome.\n\nDavidMasin:\n\nYou can theoretically fetch into the “Main” System but I strongly wouldn’t recommend it. If you do it in sections (System 1, System 2…) it would be a lot more organized. But you can do it if you want all of the parts in a single page.\n\nGot it. I believe that answers another question of mine: Is this a structured BOM or a flat BOM?

There are many different pieces of hardware that come in the swerve modules that we use, and likely the planetary gearboxes we use as well. These come in as undefined and don’t show up in any of the sub-categories. Is there a way to clear these?\n\nAlso, all of the parts came in as in-house parts and did not filter into the different categories. It doesn’t look like there is a way to make them move to that category without re-importing.\n\nFor example, about 90% of the parts imported are actually COTS parts but did not import as such.
