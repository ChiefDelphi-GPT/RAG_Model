                    "cooked": "Yesterday when the team was testing their mecanum robot (from 2022 season) trying to drive onto the Charging Station to see if they felt they could build a mecanum this year, they noticed that only the front wheels of the robot were spinning (by power) when trying to climb onto the Station. (The other two were just rolling.) In an attempt to understand if it was a code, electrical, or mechanical issue, we wrote some data to Shuffleboard. The test was performed with the wheels off the floor to reduce the number of variables. My expertise is not electrical, and I’m having trouble understanding the data collected.\n\nThe test was with the robot wheels spinning only forward; therefore all the encoders should relatively be the same. Which they are (as can be seen) so all the wheels are getting power. What I don’t understand is the data coming from the PDP. I believe from what I had read it is showing the current for each channel on the PDP. Why is there such a large variability? The motors for the drivetrain are on channels 14 (left front), 0 (right front), 13 (left rear), 12 (right rear). Because these are all identical motors (NEOs) with identical motor controllers (SparkMax) shouldn’t they all be the same? If they aren’t, what does that mean? Also all the motors on the robot are NEOs except for one. IMG_8820_resize 1440×1080 152 KB\n\nIMG_8820_resize 1440×1080 152 KB\n\nIMG_8820_resize 1440×1080 152 KB",
