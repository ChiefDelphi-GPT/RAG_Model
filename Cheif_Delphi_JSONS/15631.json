The wire connections at the roborio and PDB and PCM, with the push in Wago connectors, require the wire to have the correct amount of insulation removed from the end, and should hold firmly enough that you can’t pull out the wire with a gentle tug. The plug in connectors that are included with most speed controllers need to have the two colors connected properly, yellow to yellow, green to green, and also they need to have some tension when you try to pull them apart–they should not be loose.\n\nIf you are soldering, whoever does the soldering needs to know what they’re doing, to make a good connection. If you are using some other type of connector, you need to make sure the wire is prepared properly, and installed correctly.\n\nAlso, are you using a “daisy chain” or “star” topology? that is, are all the devices connected in one long string, or are they all tied to one point?\n\nPictures help, also…maybe we can see something that you don’t know to look for.",

Starting at the Rio, inspect the lights on each device to see if they’re indicating an error. It’s usually pretty clear where the break is, so fix that and keep moving on.\n\nAt the break, you’re looking to make sure the wires continue as yellow to yellow and green to green. Make sure the wires are still twisted and that the connectors are snug. Gently push and pull on the connectors to make sure it’s a solid connection. We moved to Waygo lever nuts this year after futzing with JST and solder in previous years.\n\nConnections are usually the problem, but we also found a bad Talon causing problems last year and once we replaced it, everything worked.\n\nAt the ends of the loop, make sure it’s terminated. On the Rio, that’s easy since there are no options. We finish the loop in the PDP which means you need to use the inner connectors and have the jumper set to terminate. YMMV if you use a different termination device.\n\nPhoenix Tuner is also a good tool to have since you can quickly see if you can talk to each device.\n\nThe key is to be methodical.",

[Note, we have not tested all CAN devices and only know that the SPARK MAX does not shows up in the CAN Bus under Phoneix Tuner but it will be bypassed and continued on to the next device until the PDP].\n\nCouple of other things to remember: CAN BUS requires a twisted pair to maintain the proper impendence so make sure that you don’t have stretches of CAN wirings that are outside of twisted pair (other than the connection points),  If in doubt, only use Daisy Chain wiring method for CAN BUS.",

Could this be causing issues?\n\nThis is kind of what the bundle looks like: image 3024×4032 3.64 MB Obviously, there are a lot more than just can wires in the bundles in this picture. Thoes are no longer like that as the power leads have been connected to the pdp and the first and las can connections have been extended to other modules.\n\nimage 3024×4032 3.64 MB\n\nimage 3024×4032 3.64 MB",

Wires that power motors can emit RFI, which signal wires can be sensitive to. I expect it’s more of an issue with brush motors, than brushless, but I’d still keep them separate.",

I don’t like bundling wires with power either as you’re inviting noise and also make it harder to troubleshoot.  I don’t even recommend bundling wires until you know it’s working.\n\nRemember - a problem defined is half solved. Lay out your problem and what you expect to see.",

That said, afaik we can see all devices on the can network (8 falcon motors), can connect to them and make them all spin individually, and can make them spin while running code. The swerve drive in general is having some issues, which i think would be best described with a video, so i will get that, but the main CAN related error we are getting (again, afaik) is a “CAN Frame not received/too-stale” error, which appears while the swerve code is running. I am not sure if this error is given with a specific can device, but if it is, and if that info would be helpful, i can ask for that info.",

From what ive read, this issue is generally caused as a result of voltage sag induced by high load and the performance level lead acid batteries we use in frc, or just msc. wiring imperfections. i was under the impression though that about 24in of 12awg wire wouldnt be enough to cause this much voltage drop under normal circumstances, but am i wrong about that? I assume the falcon’s escs are smart enough to be able to regulate current draw, should i consider lowering this?\n\nseanw:\n\nIt should give you the CAN ID of the device which will tell you if it’s always the same one or not.\n\ngotta ask sw man, but ill check on that this weekend.",
