For my command, which involves waiting one second after the `isFinished` condition is met, I implemented a workaround by introducing a local integer variable. This variable increments each time `isFinished` is triggered, and when it reaches 50 (assuming each iteration takes approximately 20ms), `isFinished` returns true. However, I'm seeking feedback on whether this approach is reasonable or if there's a more effective method.",

If you code the use of the Timer class exactly as the WaitCommand does, then obviously it will work but why duplicate what others have already coded for you? And it is best as others point out above to use the Wait factory that I linked to. Reduced amount of code is concise, faster to code, easier to read and understand - less prone to errors for all involved. Use of the factories and composites emphasize the Robot action problem being solved instead of being concerned with how the solution was coded in the programming language. That is the Command factories and compositions are the language of your problem instead of using more code to show how to accomplish a solution in Java, C++, etc. I believe Oblarg has referred to this “as working in the problem state instead of the solution state.” The fun part for most roboticists is making the robot move to our command and it’s generally a bit tedious and error prone to have to worry about how exactly to accomplish that with basic Java statements with your own design of state machines, etc. Command Based is the customized language of robot action – basic Java is not and factories and compositions are your friends to ease Command Based coding.",

                    "cooked": "The primary difference is when and how the timer is initiated. In a sequential command group, if the current command finishes, the next one is initialized in the same loop. For the wait command, that means it’s restarted and you’re golden. For example, performing some tasks followed by starting a timer with your `isFinished` method returning `$timer.hasElapsed` produces the same result as sequentially executing that work and then using a wait command. If additional steps are involved, you have more control over timer setup, start, restart, or reset timing.\n\nOne subtle consideration from my initial thought process is that if both your work and timer begin during `initialize` in a custom command, they will start simultaneously. However, if the first command (e.g., moving a motor) is an instant command, it runs during sequential initialization. When `execute` is called, it does nothing, `isFinished` returns true, and the initialize method triggers on your wait command. This causes your wait command to begin approximately 20 milliseconds later compared to if they were part of the same subclassed command. While this may seem small, it’s worth noting due to potential timing implications.",
