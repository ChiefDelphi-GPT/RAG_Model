I buy a lot of gift cards under advantageous terms (either money off or getting more credit card points than I’d normally get going straight with the company), but I’ve never loved the waste factor.  I keep a container of empty ones for tasks–spreading glues, scraping stuff that doesn’t need a razor blade, things like that–and at my last job I chopped up many to make really cheap battery interrupters (and I’d happily put mine against the COTS ones).\n\nIn 2022, we put on an AndyMark printed breaker guard .  At SCRAP 2022, an errant intake from an opponent smashed it and hit the breaker hard enough to halt the robot for the last bit of the match.  Ironically, I didn’t have a gift card handy–but we had gaffer tape and our lead teacher’s EMT credential, and that got us through the day.\n\nNow that I’m the owner of my own 3D printer, I decided to give myself a task.\n\nDesign objectives:\n\nMinimize filament usage–beat the AndyMark shield and Nick Aarested’s excellent shroud , probably by using gift cards to bridge spaces.\n\nProvide a reasonable amount of protection against the button being bumped, assuming a frame member is close enough by to absorb the worst of most hits.  (I’m not expecting any printed shield to survive the whack we took at SCRAP 2022.)\n\nI’m hardly a master designer (teams I’ve been on have won two events in 20 years playing offense), so it took a few rounds to get happy with it:\n\nIMG_2777 1920×2560 727 KB\n\nIMG_2777 1920×2560 727 KB\n\nIMG_2777 1920×2560 727 KB\n\nThe first round was a complete spitball.  I guessed at the sizes needed to accommodate a standard credit card , and the result was much too tight.  In the process, I also snapped some of the legs.\n\nGeneration 2 gave me the card notch size I’ve used since, and I started playing with gussets to strengthen the posts on the sides that don’t get cards.  Generation 3 was another version of that, using the space from the bottom of the breaker to the bottom of the stud to tie them together.\n\nThe last generation was when I realized the long sides really didn’t need to be straight at all.  I also shortened the posts holding the cards, since they weren’t really doing much at the top, and I sent Onshape’s Lighten feature script after the bottom plate.\n\nThe result of all this?  On my Bambu P1P on Extra Draft settings (and Random seam position) with a 0.4mm nozzle, BambuStudio reports:\n\nAndyMark breaker shield: 40.42 grams of filament, 1h5m print time\n\nNick Aarested’s Shroud: 19.18 grams of filament, 36m12s print time\n\nMine: 11.99 grams, 35m8s print time.  (My shipping scale reads 18-20 grams with two gift cards thrown on, but that’s on the very low end of its reading range so I don’t trust the number for much.)\n\nWill this cure the world?  Nah.  Does it use less filament and get one more use out of waste plastic? Yeah. Baby steps.\n\nHere’s the Onshape document , if you’d like to play with it.  It’s designed to mount like the AndyMark mount, with bolts holding the breaker to the mount and a larger plate below.\n\nIMG_2776 1920×2560 304 KB\n\nIMG_2776 1920×2560 304 KB\n\nIMG_2776 1920×2560 304 KB\n\nThe cards are fairly comfortable in the slots, but I’d put a drop of CA glue on the cards once installed before competing with it.\n\nIf you make it, let me know what you think!\n\nLate edit: Also put it on Printables.",

I’ll definitely be showing this to the team for next year’s robot.\n\nSecond, why did they switch the KoP to the Optifuse breakers? What was wrong with the old Bussman breakers? Those things are practically bulletproof. Goodness knows we’ve had them take serious hits and come through undamaged (though they have been switched off a couple of times, thus my warm feelings for Billfred’s fine work.) We didn’t switch last season because we’d done all the opt-outs and we have several brand new in-box Bussmans still sitting around the shop. Did no one do durability testing on the Optifuses at FIRST HQ before they sent them out in the KoP?",

Or will you all be running it at SCRIW?\n\nI haven’t gotten runtime on it yet, but I tried to bust the cards by bending them toward the inside and wasn’t able to apply a force that actuated the breaker’s trip button.  The (unglued) cards actually popped out of their channels first before any of the print failed, and the transparent part of that Starbucks card in the pictures shows some fatigue marks from me trying to bend it.  Having the cards so close to the sides of the breaker seems to help here, since they don’t have room to do anything too silly.  I wouldn’t run it on the very exterior of a robot, but then I think you’re tempting fate mounting main breakers to the very exterior of a robot no matter what shielding you’re running.  As protection against a stray part or game piece inside a robot, I think it’ ll please a lot of folks.\n\nAssuming we have the people available to field the robot at SCRIW on top of our hosting duties, our main breaker needs a relocation anyway (the SCRAP rebuild took away the easy access angle, and we didn’t notice that until SCRAP).  I’ ll work that into the plan.",
