To make larger commands out of smaller commands, you have to compose them into command groups.\n\nI see CommandGroups in the 2022 docs , where it seems like you have to create a subclass of SequentialCommandGroup ( is subclassing necessary? ), but in the current docs , it seems they are encouraging an inline style using .andThen() , etc.\n\nLet’s say I wanted to use runOnce() , or run() , and andThen() , and until() as in the current docs.  How could I pass an existing command (e.g. PrintCommand ) so that it is not just instantiated and then thrown away?  I assumed that runOnce() would actually schedule the instantiated command.

What I really want is to run something multiple times until a condition is true, something like:\n\nMaybe there is a clearer way to write the above (?), because the different syntax for passing Commands to run()/runOnce() vs things like andThen() doesn’t seem like a crisp way to do things.",
