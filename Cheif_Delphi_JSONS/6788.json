Please correct me if I am mistaken.\n\nI’d like to start a discussion about the applications of more complex vision algorithms and possibly artificial intelligence during the TELEOP phase of FRC matches, and beyond. I am primarily considering swerve drive in my thoughts, firstly because we have used swerve drive successfully for the first time this year and secondly because it is becoming the most common drive train.\n\nI’m certain that I’m not the first person to think about this kind of thing, but looking briefly into the kind of technology integrated into Tesla Autopilot by which the car can quickly and completely autonomously make accurate decisions based on many factors in a variety of environments, it inspired an idea in my mind in which a robot makes decisions on the field based on, firstly where it knows it cannot go, (we already have this in the form of PathPlanner’s on-the-fly path generation) and secondly where it determines that other robots are.\n\nI have not personally seen examples of teams being able to determine an accurate position of each robot around it (within a useable distance), but if any have, please let me know! I’d love to look into it.\n\nThe two primary applications that I considered for such an idea are:\n\nUsing the position of other robots to autonomously move around them, thereby decreasing cycle time, and\n\nusing the position of other robots to autonomously play effective and legal defense.\n\nWhile in one sense I personally am super interested in the development of this, I am also concerned about the adverse issues it may cause and that it seems inevitable. My main concern is that, if such technology becomes more common and/or available for purchase, students will no longer need to learn about vision processing pipelines (an issue I know others have brought up) and the need for pure human driver skill will be less and less.\n\nIn conclusion, these are my personal thoughts on the matter and I’m very interested to see other opinions and history on it.",

I agree with you that there are likely teams thinking about and considering this in upcoming years.\n\nI’d love to write a novel about ideas for this. But sadly being at work is my reality.\n\nI think you’ll see in the coming years some more efforts to embrace Lidar for obstacle avoidance. I thought I read in docs or posts that pathplanner’s pathfinding already has something in place to support this if you have sensors to pass in additional obstacles than what’s specified in the navgrid. I haven’t dug deep into other teams using this in the past like 88 in 2022(?) And whether IR was affected by polycarb field walls or varying lighting conditions between fields.\n\nTime of flight cameras and stereo depth might be cool for this too. But I forget if there are external windows in a venue whether or not the Sun would affect reliability/ resolution. ( i know ToF really didn’t work great outside when I played with them in the past, and can’t remember if the wavelengths of light i’m worried about go thru glass), and stereo depth to my knowledge is very taxing on processors. Especially now that intel RealSense product line has been phasing out.\n\nAnother avenue I was wondering if teams would use this year was google coral / neural networks for bumpers detection. I thought I saw a few of the open datasets had notes, red robots, and blue robots ( oh my!) But i’m unaware of the accuracy rates of that detection.  But i bet you could calculate the rough distance to a robot based on the x or y fov the target took up, and the avarage bumper width or height.\n\nHope that helps from somebody who’s also interested in the topic!",

                    "cooked": "So, to be clear, I think your thread title is one block in a system for a more-automated robot.\n\nI’ve laid this out more than once, but not recently.\n\nToday’s robots are already highly automated, especially in autonomous. They execute a fixed sequence of steps assuming a fixed notion of where the driveable notions of the field are, with an assumption of gamepiece location and what the optimal scoring strategy is.\n\nBuilding blocks teams are currently assembling to achieve this:\n\ncommand based architecture to create software-defined robot behaviors\n\nLocalization (including apriltags)\n\nPathplanning with fixed paths\n\nSome additional building blocks that could be developed:\n\nVision-based gamepiece identification to find “target” locations\n\nVision-based robot identification to identify “keep-out” locations\"\n\nDynamic pathplanning with 1 and 2 in mind (PathPlanner’s already got some building blocks for this too)\n\nControllers which allow operators to indicate what they want the robot to do (say, a queue of tasks), not how to do it ( not joysticks for motion commands).\n\nCritically, at this point, you’re still using human drivers to derive a task list. I would call this phase 1. “Task Automation”\n\nAn additional layer could be to also automate generating that task list, which would require blocks like:\n\nAbility to read game state in from FMS\n\nAbility to guess intent of other robots\n\nHand written (or AI trained??) algorithm for making decisions\n\n???\n\nWhatever those blocks are, they then and only then take the human’s place fully automating the decision making on what the robot should do. Call that phase 2. “Mission Automation”.\n\nI think we’re just a few seasons out from seeing teams implement a phase 1 on the field and score well (IE, it’s a competitive advantage). Phase 2 is much longer term.\n\nSirFire:\n\nMy main concern is that, if such technology becomes more common and/or available for purchase, students will no longer need to learn about vision processing pipelines (an issue I know others have brought up)\n\nLike most engineering exercises, we’re just adding more layers. FRC in general is moving up in the technical stack over the years (remember 2008 when your code ran on bare metal on the CPU?). Today’s challenge is less and less “create X from scratch”, and more and more “integrate X into your robot”. Which… is still not easy - we’ve got 50 slides we’re about to present on it this week .\n\nSirFire:\n\nthe need for pure human driver skill will be less and less.\n\nThis is perhaps more real as you move into my described autonomy. Still, this isn’t unique here. As humans make better and better tools, you move away from the need for vast numbers of people who can manually execute a task, and increase the need for people who can design tools to execute tasks automatically.",

So far weve had decent success with robot and note tracking on the device and with a relatively small dev time allocation. The hardware takes some gettig used to since its a bit limited and models need to be converted, bit its incredibly simple to use. It does come with the FRC early addoper tax of having to worite all the robot to coproc intefsce code yourself, but thats mostly just messing with NT4.\n\nFor the record: the dpeth error weve observed is in line with their published specs (6% at 8m for the OAK-D lite) tho latency can def be an issue with us getting about 300ms (EDIT: 200ms after some tuning today) with on device processing on a Yolov5n modle. Tho we are looking into reducing this by using yolov6n or moving the ml on coproc.",

                    "cooked": "So let’s talk about how FSD works under the hood.\n\nSensor wise, Elon has a fascination with vision only. And Teslas do not possess depth cameras. Under the hood they are using monocular depth estimation models that have been trained on outdoor environments to estimate metric depth of each pixel. From there they put their objects into a “4d vector space” generated off a custom built model. This is a fancy way of saying “we put it in a representation that we can ask questions about objects as a function of location and time”. This allows them to reason about their operating space.\n\nSo if you wanted to replicate this in FRC you have one big choice early on - depth camera or monocular camera?  Depth cameras are more expensive and require a bit more compute (unless you’re using something like the Intel Realsense line which does processing onboard, though I know 900 has gone away from these) Monocular cameras are cheaper but give require more thought on how to get depth out of it.\n\nAfter that you need to build some way of tracking objects between frames. Tesla uses their ML expertise here and their model takes multiple video frames (and in fact multiple camera angles) into account here. I don’t recommend going down this route unless you have several ML experts in house, and a lot of compute. I’ve found fairly adequate behavior over short durations (5-10 seconds) using simple tools like ByteTrack . My preferred approach here is a very simple ECS system to allow me to simulate the physics of found dynamic objects, persist static objects, and decay detections over time. It’s not as elegant as the ML solution likely but I’ve used ECS systems for a lot in the past and know I can make them work.\n\nAfter that you just need to build an API around the simulation system to be able to ask temporal/spatial questions about it. This drove most of why I went with the ECS approach as they are effective at being able to move forward and backward in time.\n\nPersonally, I’ve gone down the monocular approach. I have detection and relative depth working ok, need to find some time to sit down and read the papers on ZoeDepth’s metric depth estimation to see if I can get reliable information. Fortunately I have a virtual environment that I can take a robot path, put a camera on the robot, and output metric depth training data if I need to fine tune ( FRC fields are fairly nice in that they are constrained environments making this much simpler…in theory). Virtual: 000043 640×640 41.1 KB Rel Depth + Note Detector PNG image 1272×1278 52.4 KB\n\n000043 640×640 41.1 KB\n\n000043 640×640 41.1 KB\n\nPNG image 1272×1278 52.4 KB\n\nPNG image 1272×1278 52.4 KB\n\nThis is all a fun theory but I’m not entirely sure how useful it will be in FRC in the short term. Our required precisions are fairly high. If you look closely at the data coming out of FSD it is regularly off by 5-10\" This is fine when you have a 7’ car and a nominally 12’ lane and need to stop a reasonable distance from other cars. (My old Tesla used to scream coming into the garage yelling I needed to stop when I was a foot away from the side of the garage) but in FRC those distances are worse than what tuned wheel odometry can get you. Yes tools like particle filters can help with localization but those have additional compute requirements too (though likely lighter than the approach outlined above).\n\nAnd this has been my brain dump on FSD for the night, hope some folks found it mildly interesting.",

This is a relatively new systen for us and we only started development on monday lmao, tho ive pretty much pulled back to back all nighters getting it to this point (it can interface with robot code). As far simple object detection, the rpi4 does not have a TPU so you won’t see  good real-time performance, id look into 2d object tracking with photonvision and a orange pi 5, weve been running a similar systen to that since 2023 offseason.",

Specifically, using oak.callback() seems to have a significant impact on performance (about a ~50-75% FPS reduction!). You can get around this by modifying your custom python function and calling it using the decode_fn argument in oak.create_nn() , which seems to get around the issue (Documentation example here ).\n\nAll my prior DepthAI code used the Python API directly, as the SDK was just starting to be developed at the time. This didn’t run into as many performance issues, but looking back at it now, it is extremely messy/hard to follow.",

I think giving the driver more time to practice is more time efficient, and will have a better outcome. I don’t even think 3d gamepiece pose will be really effective if you have a wide touch-it-own-it intake",
