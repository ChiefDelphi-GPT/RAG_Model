                    "cooked": "PathPlanner 2024 beta 1 has now been released. A lot has changed this year, and as always, I’d appreciate any feedback.\n\nYou can download the latest beta from here , and install PathPlannerLib through VSCode. The wiki has been completely reworked for this new version, and includes more PathPlannerLib usage examples that should hopefully be helpful in getting you all up to speed with how everything works now.\n\nNOTE: PathPlannerLib 2024 requires WPILib 2024. You can not run the new version with 2023 robot code.\n\nJust about everything. The UI has been reworked and PathPlannerLib has been completely rewritten to hopefully be easier to use and address some of the pain points from last year. It also provides some exciting new features I’ll get into later. So, since everything is a bit different I would recommend taking a look at the wiki and examples even if you are already familiar with PathPlanner.\n\nAnyways, here’s some notes on the major changes/additions:\n\nA major driving force behind a lot of the UI changes is the concept of paths and autos being separate things. This is an expansion on the event marker, stop point, and stop event systems from last year combined with being able to use paths modularly. So, instead of creating one large path for an entire auto routine, you now create each segment as its own path. You can then chain these paths together, along with other commands, in an auto. Now, you can use a path in multiple autos, and when you update that path, all autos using it are updated as well.\n\nEverything relevant to edit a path or auto is now contained in a tree structure within the editor. No more switching between editor modes or clicking through a bunch of waypoints to change stuff. The tree also has a visual command group builder for making more complex event markers and autos.\n\nThe default screen for the PathPlanner app is now a project browser, which will display a preview of all your paths and autos. This supports the same functionality that the sidebar did previously (rename, delete, duplicate) as well as a new folder feature for easier organization\n\nHolonomic rotation is no longer tied to each waypoint. Instead, you can set a target rotation at any point along the path. When path following, the robot will attempt to rotate to the next rotation target along the path.\n\nConstraints are now set in the GUI instead of PathPlannerLib. There is now also a “constraints zone” feature that allows you to apply different constraints within a zone along the path. The start and end points of these zones can be placed anywhere along the path.\n\nThis is an expansion on the previous “PathPlannerLib server” feature. The “server” now uses NT4, so it is supported in both Java and C++.\n\nThere is now a separate “Telemetry” page in the app to display real time path following telemetry if connected to the robot.\n\nThis is a fun one. If connected to the robot using the above telemetry feature, you can enable a setting called “hot reload”. When this is enabled, and you are connected to the robot, any changes you make to paths or autos will be synced to the robot automatically (as long as the robot is disabled). No need to rebuild code, redeploy, or even restart. Just set back up and run it again with the new changes. Every reference to a path or auto in your robot code will get the updated version. It goes without saying, but you should make sure this is disabled at competition so you don’t accidentally change something you don’t mean to.\n\nNote: C++ only supports hot reload for paths, not autos. This is due to restrictions in the C++ commands library.\n\nI know, crazy.\n\nPathPlannerTrajectory is no longer directly interacted with by the user. A trajectory will be generated by the path following commands\n\nYou now load paths as a PathPlannerPath using PathPlannerPath.fromPathFile\n\nAutos are created as PathPlannerAuto via a constructor that takes in an auto name. You need to configure the AutoBuilder in order to load autos. PathPlannerAuto can be used like any other command.\n\nCommands have been renamed to better reflect their function. i.e. FollowPathHolonomic , FollowPathRamsete , and FollowPathLTV\n\nThe path following commands can now automatically replan paths if necessary. This means that you can start a path from any arbitrary position, and a new path will be generated that will join with the original path from the robot’s location. This is why the start/end points of paths in autos do not need to be aligned.\n\nThere are also settings available to enable replanning if the robot has large path following error, or from an error spike. This could help the robot react more smoothly to collisions and odometry corrections.\n\n“Named Commands” is the new name for “events” used by event markers. In PPLib 2024 all of the named commands are registered and accessed through the NamedCommands class. You no longer need to create and pass around your own event map.\n\nThe second variant is for pathfinding to a pre-defined path, then following that path. This is useful for having fine control over the end of a pathfinding movement, such as lining up with a human player station or scoring position.\n\nFurthermore, this system technically works for dynamic obstacle avoidance, allowing you to feed in bounding boxes of other robots, game pieces, etc. and automatically avoid them while pathfinding. However, this is going to be considered unofficially supported for now since there is a lot of ways that some really weird stuff can happen. This should really only be used by people who really know what they’re doing.\n\nFinally, this system was built specifically with holonomic drivetrains in mind. It will be a lot harder to get good results with a differential drivetrain. But the option is still there to use differential pathfinding commands.\n\nBe aware that the path mirroring from the 2023 version is not included in 2024, assuming that the 2024 game will have standard field mirroring. If not, I will add in a solution.\n\nThat’s most of the major stuff. Again, I recommend checking out the wiki and examples for info on how to use all of this. Some of the more advanced examples and a full example project are still works in progress, but all of the basics are there.\n\nThese initial beta releases will not be pushed to app stores, but I will leave their links here for future reference.",

So, worst case on the RIO likely isn’t too bad. It also runs in a separate thread so if it does end up taking longer than 20ms it won’t cause a loop overrun. The time it takes to calculate is only really relevant for the first iteration, as it will continue following that first path as it calculates an improved one in the background.\n\nI’m also working on an executable that can be used to offload the pathfinding to a coprocessor.

But, this would still be very difficult to make useful since the whole point of pathfinding is to get from any random position to the given position. So, how would you be able to determine at what point you need to place a certain event marker based on a path with a length determined by that random position? And even if each path has a constant number of points, how would you know that point X is going to be at a position relevant to the command you want to run? There’s just so many contingencies you’d need to plan for.",

(Just AdvantageKit the logging library, not AdvantageScope the data visualizer). No other features should be affected, but I just want to avoid confusion since this specific feature won’t work correctly when using log replay. Hopefully we can find a solution longer term, but I haven’t had a chance to look at this in detail.\n\nOverall, these updates look fantastic. I’m particularly happy about the move to NT4, since it makes all of PathPlanner’s telemetry compatible with other tools (AdvantageScope) for debugging!",

I don’t think I can do this in a way that would work with a different pathfinder since the built in pathfinding command does some special logic for transitioning to the defined path. But, you could always copy those commands into custom versions and edit it to work with your pathfinder.\n\njonahb55:\n\nNo other features should be affected, but I just want to avoid confusion since this specific feature won’t work correctly when using log replay.\n\nHmm didn’t really think about log replay. Although, shouldn’t it still work to some extent since the commands run during replay will still pass the data over to the pathfinder? It could do some weird stuff like skipping a bunch of loops when not running in real-time… which I guess really affects everything after that point then. I’ll see if I can think of something.\n\ndan:\n\nAnd would using AdvantageKit be a problem if we want to use pathfinding?\n\nThe test project I’ve been using uses advantage kit.
