                    "cooked": "Hi CD, here is my quick rant about product specs from FRC vendors. So, specs mean maximum revolutions per minute, maximum static load, and maximum dynamic load. These are critical factors in determining if a product will perform under expected conditions. Looking through the specs, I noticed that some sites don't provide detailed information, relying instead on user guides or datasheets. For instance, McMaster-Carr offers comprehensive resources for nearly every product, whereas others require digging deeper or consulting manufacturers. In comparison, McMaster, McMaster Carr, Bearings Direct, Online Metals, Molex, and Strapworks provide varying levels of detail. For bearings and bushings, key specs include RPM, static load, and dynamic load capacities. Other considerations like tolerances and bearing numbers can be helpful. Overall, students should learn how to identify reliable sources and utilize them to design more durable and efficient systems. VEX and FIRST Robotics Competition vendors should improve their spec offerings to meet market demands.",

The McMaster bearings specifications are crafted to suit non-technical buyers, enabling engineers to pair an item with various compatible parts. The engineering specs must be broad enough to allow any part meeting or surpassing them to be approved for use over several years. However, if a part fails to meet its specs, it will require investigation and remediation at vendors’ costs, which could take years. The FRC vendor standard for mechanical parts states, “we used them and they did fine, here’s CAD to 0.002in,” which works well for our market since we don’t invest in extensive spec validation for vendors. We lack a system to retrofit FRC robots with suitable bearings due to the time needed for load case measurement and validation, which is essential for drafting service agreements and warranties. Additionally, changing this approach would be costly, considering the trust issues inherent in the FRC market—hobbyist in nature—with sloppier fits and guesswork. Such changes might involve fixing issues like non-uniform hexfits, last seen around 2017 and now commonly addressed with rounded hexagons.",

It is preferable to provide basic information for educational purposes rather than extensive testing or investigation. The focus should be on teaching engineering principles rather than engaging in \"bro-science.\"\n\nReposting factory specs such as RPMs on bearings or wire strand counts is sensible for resale products. However, for custom FRC (First Robotics Competition) items, providing formal specs or validation is challenging and less justified.\n\nWhen considering custom bushings designed for a rounded hex shaft, it is important to include margins for potential shaft misalignment. Teams may complain if the bushing binds due to alignment issues, even if it deviates from the original specifications.\n\nSpec sheets often lack specific details needed in professional settings, highlighting the value of \"qualified by similarity.\" Engineering discussions about applicable conditions and differences between uses are crucial and should be encouraged.",

When dealing with round shafts in round holes, one can obtain some load ratings, and when considering the involvement of oil, calculating where the shaft lifts off and floats within the oil film becomes feasible. This involves utilizing abbreviations like PV (pressure times velocity) along with somewhat vague calculations. Additionally, plastic bearings tend to expand with heat and moisture, complicating matters further. Another important point is that round corner hex does not allow for liftoff; instead, the operational zone remains narrow, and misalignment exacerbates issues.",

I had consulting project once where an automation company was having bearing failures on one of their products. They had tried a bunch of different suppliers, including all the most expensive name brands, before giving up and spending thousands on outside consultants. All the math we could come up with showed that those bearings should have been fine, but switching them out with slightly larger ones fixed everything. FRC bots see very high vibrations, often very poor build quality and assembly practices and the service life of an FRC bot is extremely short. The specs you find on McMaster or those other websites are based on conditions totally unlike ours and shouldn’t be trusted much anyway.",
