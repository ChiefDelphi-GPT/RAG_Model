                    "cooked": "I updated the Robot Inspection Cheat sheets with the new motors and new controllers allowed in 2025. I had to completely remake the electronics diagram so I only have the PDH version as I suspect that will be most common. I’ll probably have to repeat that next year for the new control system. Hopefully they will release info on the control system early so I can start putting new diagrams together for that.  I want to credit the original design to Mike Carter and later maintained by John Stratis many years ago.  I’ve only been trying to keep up with the changes for the last ~5 years.\n\nThis is probably a good place to include a link to the Inspection Checklist . I’d recommend comparing this to your robot prior to your event.  Be aware that it sometimes gets updated between competitions, so try to get the latest.  It is also worth mentioning that the bumper rules have a general 0.25 inch tolerance built in that is included in the checklist so it may look like it doesn’t match specific rules, but is accurate to the rules.\n\nI’m sure we will see many bumper inspection tools . I’m actually still working on this one. This is a “no-go” tool that measures to the limits of the rules with the margins included. It specializes in what I see as the 4 most critical measurements.  I’m considering dropping some of the outside measurements in favor of making a ruler-like section.\n\nIn case anyone wants a breaker protector , this one was designed by Jon Smith.\n\nAs long as I have your attention, I want to mention that some events are allowing a weigh in during the load-in period.  Keep an eye on communication from your program delivery partner to see if that is an option at your event.  The expectation is that this will reduce the line for the scale that we had seen form when pits opened in the past. I would like to request that teams please come to inspection early . Give the Inspectors the opportunity to make sure that there are no big issues (i.e. frame perimeter, weight, safety) that could take a while to fix. After you pass inspection you can make any changes you want / need and get reinspected.\n\n2025 Electronics v1.pdf (1.1 MB) 2025 Motors and Pneumatics v1.pdf (694.1 KB)",

The most common configurations are likely to cause power to backfeed into the RoboRio and some RoboRios heat up from the power backfeed. This has been observed to cause  RoboRio instability.\n\nOne of the CSAs from the Heartland Regional asked me to have my inspectors looking for this at the Greater Kansas City Regional. My Inspectors told me that a majority of teams had problems with this that we fixed and the CSA told me that the RoboRio instability and random reboots were not happening like they did at the Heartland Regional.\n\nVivid Host Radio - 2025.pdf (1.0 MB)\n\nI also updated my Bumper Inspection Tool . Credit to Gary Hannah for the idea of moving the team number measurement to a hole through the tool.  Credit to Michael Hartwig for the idea of adding measurement markings to one of the sections so it can be used like a ruler.",
