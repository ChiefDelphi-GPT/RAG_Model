                    "cooked": "Hi all, Atlantis Kit is a set of tools for working with WPILib and specifically AdvantageKit. It simplifies the management of robot inputs, value tuning from the dashboard, periodic alerts, and more. Atlantis Kit is designed to help teams boost development speed, improve efficiency in working with the robot, and easily incorporate advanced features, all while maintaining clean, organized code without unnecessary complexity. Two years ago, I came across AdvantageKit, Team 6328’s excellent logging and replay library. After reading the documentation and experimenting with it, I was really impressed with its power and flexibility. However, I felt the API could be improved and made cleaner and easier to work with. That led me to develop a lightweight abstraction layer on top of AdvantageKit - Log Fields. Later, I realized there wasn’t a good way to have value tuning and live interaction with the dashboard that’s both replay-safe and easy to use, while still being powerful and flexible. So, I created Tunables - an extension of WPILib’s Sendable system that is not only replay-safe but also includes additional features. Since then, more team members joined the development effort, and together we’ve added various small utilities to the library, including periodic alerts, value holders, and sensor helpers. We’ve been using Atlantis Kit continuously since the 2023 offseason, and it has greatly improved our code quality and development process. Now, we’d love to share it with the community. Atlantis Kit consists of four primary parts: Log Fields – An abstraction over AdvantageKit that simplifies the definition of inputs and outputs, creating a cleaner and less error-prone API for IO management. Tunables – An extension of WPILib’s Sendable system that enables interactive tuning and command execution from the dashboard, while remaining safe for replay. It also includes useful features like nesting and convenient construction of tunable commands using the command composition API. Periodic Alerts – An extension of WPILib’s Alert class. They automatically and periodically update the activation and message of an alert. Sensors Helpers – A growing collection of helper classes for managing sensors. Currently only includes RotationalSensorHelper, but planned to be expanded. Until now, because our library was only used internally, we had it as a simple folder that we’ve copied to each project. To make it easier for other teams to use the library as well, we have now added it as a vendor dependency: https://atlantis2679.github.io/AtlantisKit/AtlantisKit.json We also wrote some docs in the GitHub wiki page, which you can find here: https://github.com/Atlantis2679/AtlantisKit/wiki. This documentation is still not perfect, and some pages are more polished than others, but we would be more than happy to help you out, hear any feedback, and make improvements. You are also welcome to check out our robot code projects on GitHub, for the 2025 season or any other project on our page - all of them use our library. Thank you for reading, and I hope you will find our library useful!",
