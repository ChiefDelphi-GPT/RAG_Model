                    "cooked": "FRC Team 9477- Lambda (λ) is incredibly excited to reveal our 2025 Reefscape bot- Neptune!\n\nCAD LINK: Onshape\n\nCompetitions we attended:\n\nPCH District Gainesville (Qual: 6-8-1, 2nd pick of alliance 8)\n\nPCH District Statesboro (Qual: 8-8-0, 1st pick of alliance 4)\n\nPeachtree District Championship (Qual: 9-6-0, CAPTAIN of alliance 7)\n\nAwards won:\n\nIndustrial Design award (Gainesville)\n\nExcellence in Engineering award (Statesboro)\n\nWoodie Flowers Finalist award – for our amazing mentor, Mr Goli! ( DCMP )\n\nSwerve:\n\nBeing a relatively new team (started last year), we recognized that implementing a swerve drive would help us immensely, which became the biggest part of our offseason. We carried that into comp season, basing our CAD on our 28x28 chassis.\n\nClaw\n\nEarly into the comp season, we prioritized algae, which can be seen by our massive algae claw. Our electrical team really wanted to get some experience with pneumatics (it’s been their goal since we were founded), so to give the algae an extra push, we used pneumatics to “punch” it into the net. For the materials, we prototyped with polycarb but switched to carbon fiber for Gainesville. Unfortunately, during this comp, we suffered a pretty bad collision that wrecked one of our plates, and we settled on aluminum. Our design was somewhat inspired by the design Orbit went with for 2014, but we made our claw horizontal instead of vertical.\n\nOrbit 2014 robot reveal: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mjze_ZZBU\n\nAnother focus point on our claw was our smart engineering in regards to powering our motors. We made sure to power our outer 2 motors so that the algae would actually be sucked into the claw, but kept the inner ones dead so as to grip the ball better and keep it in our bot securely.\n\nClimbers\n\nUnfortunately, we never got to climb this year, but we went through 2-3 different iterations for our climber. Originally, we planned on using the climber that the RustHOUNDS Ri3D team used, but we found that it was not working as well as we wanted, and it was causing a lot of problems with the claw, as it interfered a lot with our main claw. (original climber)\n\nOur second iteration of the climber had a similar design as 2910 in a way, as both of our climbers were attached to our main claw. Unfortunately that’s where the similarities ended, as ours never truly climbed. Our second climber has the same “latch” type mechanism as the 118 Everybot, and was made at the same time as the original RustHOUNDS climber, but got implemented slightly after Gainesville.\n\nCoral?\n\nCoral wasn’t a huge priority for us, but we ended up with a mechanism for it, just in case. It was designed to score just L1, purely for the auton ranking point. Ultimately, it became more of a hassle to keep it on, especially due to it interfering with the claw, and we never got any use out of it.\n\nFollowing Gainesville, we tried again, with a couple concepts such as one similar to 6340, the Marist Manatees, where coral was taken into the bot at an angle, but only to reach the L1 and L2 scoring areas. While this was never implemented, this was designed in conjunction with one of our biggest successes: the de-algae system.\n\nDe-Algae Mechanism\n\nOur biggest weakness as an algae bot immediately became evident as we competed in our first event – we could not reach algae stuck in the higher areas of the reef. To combat this, we used our old climbers from 2024 (climber in a box), a neo vortex, and some wheels to give us that reach to remove that upper algae. Keeping everything within the frame perimeter was a huge challenge, and we created this passive system to rotate the wheel outwards, to not have to use an extra motor, or risk not even being able to make contact with the algae.\n\nWhile this subsystem was deceptively hard, it turned out to be a resounding success, and we were able to clear the reef within 10 seconds. Surprisingly, a couple teams used our concept, including one from Israel (iirc). The only upgrade we made after this was just a little bit of reinforcement to the base after Statesboro, as it was getting a little too wobbly for us.\n\nFinal stuff:\n\nOverall, the whole team is incredibly proud of our progress this season, and we don’t plan on stopping anytime soon. This season was full of trial, error, and way more zip ties than we expected, but we’re fully committed to making every season better than the last.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions, we would be more than happy to answer them!",
