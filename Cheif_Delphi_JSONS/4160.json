                    "cooked": "Hi\n\nI’m trying to implement a trapezoidal profile for our elevator, but I’m concerned that my lack of understanding of how everything “works” physics-wise will prevent me from implementing it successfully.\n\nFrom what I understand, to get to a certain velocity setpoint, we calculate the feedforward necessary, which accounts for the weight of the elevator. Therefore, if we are trying to go down slowly, the feedforward equation would result in a voltage that is actually trying to move the elevator upwards (but gravity is stronger so it moves down). But if our motor is on brake mode, won’t this not work? i.e. isn’t the whole idea of brake mode that if we turn the motor a certain direction at a certain velocity, brake mode will oppose anything trying to change that direction and velocity (so our motor won’t allow the elevator to move downwards if we are trying to move the elevator upwards)?\n\nAlso, when we get close enough to our setpoint, do we just keep applying a voltage about equivalent to our gravity feedforward term to stay in the same place, or can we just call motor.stop() since we are using krakens, and let brake mode keep us in the same position with a lower power consumption?",

So it will not interfere with your control of the elevator.\n\nWhat brake mode does in a physics sense is it converts the motor’s back-driving forces (gravity) into an electrical force in the motor; In brake mode, the wire coils are passively connected such that this generates an oppositional magnetic force, causing a slowdown. It’s working as a generator, and automatically using that power to resist the motion. When the motor controller is applying it’s own motive force, the motor coils are directly connected to the battery, and thus actively powered in a desired direction with a driven magnetic field. Any “backdrive” forces are being completely overridden, or dumped into the battery as a voltage spike.\n\nAs for the feed forward, you would want to apply it at all times, even when “idle”. If your system is geared such that brake mode mostly halts the motor when disabled/stopped, then this power needed will be small. If your system is geared such that the elevator falls quickly when disabled… then you definitely want the feed forward applied at idle. I’m not familiar with CTRE specific details here though, but I’d assume “stop” causes it to halt all output, rather than maintaining the configured forward.",

This is because even brake mode can’t apply any stopping force unless the elevator is moving – look up Eddy Current Braking or Magnetic Braking if you’re curious about why.\n\nAlso, if you do happen to pass through the zero duty cycle point (neutral mode) while you’re commanding the elevator to move downward, you’d want the motor to behave as though it were in brake mode anyway – apply zero volts to it – because it matches the same electrical model as when you’re connected to the battery anyway.  The motor controller, most abstractly, is trying to behave as a variable voltage source.  If you go for a slightly higher-fidelity model (look up “buck converter” if you want an interesting rabbithole), it’s trying to behave as a pulsed voltage source, variable duty cycle, or “connect leads to battery some of the time; connect them to each other the rest of the time”.  So, when the duty cycle hits 0, it’s just connecting the leads together all of the time and to the battery none of the time.\n\nIncidentally, this is also the behavior you want when the robot gets disabled, lest the elevator free fall and slam into its bottom stop at high speed.",

                    "cooked": "Yep. The motor will command it exactly as intended, and you won’t have stutters or anything of that sort. If you do have skipping or stuttering, that’s probably a belt, chain or other issue. Or a code one, such as setting the motor output to different values in a single loop.\n\nGronkBaby:\n\nBut when we are at a duty-cycle output of 0 and are in brake mode, doesn’t the motor resist all motion and the elevator would just stop? Does it make a difference that I am using MotionMagic?\n\nYesn’t. When you stop() the motor and set no output, you’re not telling the motor to “stay where it is”, you’re saying “do whatever the external environment says, minus the motor’s brake resistance”. What this means is that you’re letting the physics of the system decide where things end up. This means gravity and the gear ratio control the end result, and may result in the elevator simply falling down. Or staying put. Your system will do what it’s going to do.\n\nIf you apply a feed forward, but no other output, then you’re actively telling the motor to oppose gravity. Which is probably what you want. In most cases, during operation, you want the robot to oppose both gravity (feedforwards) and sudden disturbances or external factors (the closed loop / PID ).\n\nWhen the robot is disabled, now you cannot command the motor, and so brake mode or coast mode is the only thing affecting the elevator.\n\nusbcd36:\n\nAlso, if you do happen to pass through the zero duty cycle point (neutral mode) while you’re commanding the elevator to move downward, you’d want the motor to behave as though it were in brake mode anyway\n\nTo clarify what he means here: Zero crossing is the momentary swap between forward output (going up, with an output of >0) and reverse output (going down with an output <0). While unlikely to happen mathematically, it could , and represents a moment in time when the motor controller would drop to brake mode, and be the only force acting on the elevator. However, if you consider the physics and what you’re doing, that’s fine; You’re expecting positive output one moment prior, zero this one, and negative the next. The output and the elevator are all in agreement. It’s more likely you go from value>0 to value<0 and not actually hit zero perfectly.\n\nThis is different from a prolonged session of “sit in brake mode for seconds at a time”, in which you’ve explicitly waived any actual control of the bot.",
