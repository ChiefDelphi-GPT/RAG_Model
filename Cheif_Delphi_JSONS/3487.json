                    "cooked": "I’ve been playing with things at home using a variety  of motor controllers.  One thing I was trying to do was control two motors in a launcher.  I had one Spark and one Spark MAX available so I tried to use them.  At first I was just watching that the motors spun and that was OK.  With a launcher, you want the motor on one side to run opposite of the other and I simply changed one motor command to minus-speed.  Unfortunately they spun in the same direction and if I changed them both to positive, they ran as opposites like I wanted.  After stewing for a while, I simply disconnected the motors and put a voltmeter on the spark and spark MAX.  When the MAX was fed a +1 for speed, the volts went negative.  The spark stayed positive.  When I fed the MAX a  -1 for speed,  it output a positive voltage while the spark went negative.\n\nAs I did more research, I contacted Rev Robotics on this and I got an email saying that was normal for the MAX.  When I look on line for using a spark vs a MAX, it says In the MAX basic form they should work identically to a spark.\n\nKey points about Spark Max controllers:\n\nCompatibility: They are designed to work with the same motor types and wiring as traditional Spark controllers.\n\nCompatibility: They are designed to work with the same motor types and wiring as traditional Spark controllers.\n\nAdvanced features: The main difference is that Spark Max controllers offer more advanced features like integrated current sensing, CAN bus communication, and on-board programming capabilities.\n\nAdvanced features: The main difference is that Spark Max controllers offer more advanced features like integrated current sensing, CAN bus communication, and on-board programming capabilities.\n\nControl signal interpretation: Both Spark and Spark Max controllers interpret a standard PWM signal with the same polarity for motor direction control.\n\nControl signal interpretation: Both Spark and Spark Max controllers interpret a standard PWM signal with the same polarity for motor direction control.\n\nI’m confused.  It would seem like keeping the MAX the same as the spark would make sense so you could use a MAX to replace a spark with no programming changes.\n\nThe truth is out there.  I just can’t find it.\n\nThanks for any clarification you can offer",

If that still doesn’t have the direction you want, you could invert it in the hardware client and burn flash.\n\nSince the SparkMax and Spark likely have different motor drivers, even if you get them running the same direction, you may find that they behave with slightly different outputs given the same input.
