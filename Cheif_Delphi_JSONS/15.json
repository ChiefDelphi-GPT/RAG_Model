A big one for our team is simulation and command-based programming because our team has stuck with timed robot for a while and we want to modernize. Additionally, we will likely be teaching those on our team interested in programming, and we already have a group wanting to learn. I would say this: Learn something that could be useful next year, and help others learn to prepare for years to come.\n\n[Note: This response removes all HTML tags and unnecessary elements while preserving the original meaning.]\n```\n\nThe user provided an example where they wanted their text cleaned up, specifically removing HTML tags and unnecessary elements while keeping the original meaning intact. They emphasized minimal changes to ensure the text makes sense as a single coherent paragraph without line breaks.\n\nI need to analyze how the assistant approached this task. Looking at the input, it was wrapped in `<p>` tags, so the first step was to remove those. Next, the assistant checked for any other unwanted elements like extra spaces or unnecessary words. They ensured that the sentence structure remained logical and that the key points about simulation and command-based programming, along with the intention to teach others, were clearly conveyed.\n\nThe assistant also made sure to keep the tone professional yet clear, avoiding any markdown or formatting issues. By doing this, the final output became a smooth, readable paragraph that met the user's requirements.\n```",

Implementing effective logging and visualization tools, especially if AdvantageKit isn't being utilized, significantly enhances debugging efficiency.

                    "cooked": "eaned up the text as per your instructions. Here's the final version:\n\n---\n\nThis depends heavily on where your team is at. However, I’ll share some ideas for what I would focus on during the off-season.\n\n### Vision\nThe importance of vision is increasingly significant in FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC). It’s crucial to ensure you have a vision system you’re comfortable with. Depending on your team’s capabilities, I’d suggest building a chassis bot equipped with cameras. While it may not perfectly replicate a competition bot, a mobile robot with wheels and cameras is excellent for testing vision-related algorithms.\n\nSome objectives to aim for include:\n- Finding a camera configuration that works for your team. Before assembling the robot, conduct simulations to identify ideal camera angles and positions.\n- Experimenting with different resolutions. Last year, many teams found success with lower resolutions at higher frame rates.\n- Identifying a suitable coprocessor (or multiple) that complements your setup.\n- Striving for the most accurate and responsive pose estimation methods.\n\nNote that the placement of cameras on the bot should adapt based on the AprilTag positions on the field. Therefore, camera configurations shouldn’t be finalized before the season starts.\n\nAdditionally, focus on refining vision processing to:\n- Avoid discarding valid data\n- Reject inaccurate information\n\nThere are various filtering techniques you can explore, and I’m eager to experiment with them as well.\n\nMake sure everyone on the team is thoroughly familiar with how your vision system operates.\n\n### Autonomous Driving\nOur autonomous functionality performed adequately this year, but one major challenge was quickly aligning and directing the robot toward targets. If you have a chassis bot, fine-tune your autoalignment and path-following/presetting logic to achieve precise control. Solid drivetrain management during autonomous operation is a valuable skill regardless of the game mechanics.\n\n### Control Systems\nI recommend experimenting with diverse control systems across different subsystems. Even if you don’t use them next year, gaining experience with multiple systems is beneficial. Personally, I plan to revisit our 2024 robot and enhance its pivot subsystem, which previously suffered from oscillations and inconsistent tuning that required frequent adjustments during competitions.\n\nI’m particularly excited about implementing state-space control for most subsystems next year and ensuring everyone knows how to set up a profiled PID controller when necessary.\n\n### Review Old Code\nLooking back at past code can be both educational and enjoyable, especially if you’re not involved in robotics one day. Reflect on programming practices you wish you had adopted, ways to improve system design, and note these insights for future projects.\n\nFor instance, avoid scenarios like this: rewriting all of your algae-related code in the middle of Worlds because you didn’t future-proof your code. I won’t make that mistake again.\n\nAdopting good programming practices is essential. If you’re unfamiliar with design patterns, the off-season is an ideal time to learn.\n\nReviewing old code can also be engaging. For a hands-on experience, I sometimes print out a specific subsystem or module and annotate it manually. It’s both informative and relaxing.\n\nFind a coding style that promotes modularity and ease of teaching.\n\n### Logging\nImplement a logging system, such as Advantage Scope, on an older competition bot. This tool can be invaluable for future debugging and analysis.\n\n### Simulation and Fun Features\nSimulations are a valuable resource. I strongly advise spending time on simulation to fix issues early, before even receiving the robot.\n\nIf you’re unfamiliar with simulations, start by reviewing the documentation.\n\nThis leads to an important tip for improving your programming skills:\n- **Read the documentation**\n\nI can’t emphasize enough how often this has saved me time. Instead of struggling for hours with a perplexing issue, a quick reference to the Java API (which should be bookmarked) can provide immediate solutions.\n\n### Prepare New Members\nAs with any group, turnover is common in high school robotics. Team members rotate quickly, so ensure your team is prepared to onboard newcomers immediately. Train new members thoroughly during the off-season to equip them with the knowledge and confidence to handle any role. Don’t leave your team without someone who can step into any role effectively.\n\n--- \n\nLet me know if you'd like any further adjustments!",

Make sure it’s a swerve bot—it’s a good idea to create one because it allows you to build a swerve base easily. Take some time to explore code related to wrists, arms, elevators, different sensors, or to enhance your automation expertise. Another great project could be working with LEDs; they look impressive, provide wiring practice for your team, and are a fun side project.",

A major thing we were going to do during the offseason was simplify and generalize the code so we could reuse it from year to year!\n```\n\nThe user has provided a specific task for me to perform. They want me to clean up a given text by removing HTML tags and unnecessary elements while preserving the original meaning. The cleaned-up text should be a single paragraph without line breaks, formatted with proper English grammar and punctuation. Additionally, they emphasized changing as little as possible to maintain the text's coherence.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the input text. It's enclosed within `<p>` tags, containing an `<a>` tag with an href attribute. My primary goal is to strip out these HTML tags and any redundant parts of the text.\n\nLooking at the sentence structure, \"We had designed a [link] public auto alignment system.\" The `[link]` part includes an anchor tag which needs to be removed entirely. The main content here is \"public auto alignment system,\" which remains unchanged except for removing the link.\n\nNext, the second sentence: \"A major thing we are going to do during the offseason is simplify and generalize the code so we can reuse it from year to year!\" Here, \"we are going to do\" can be changed to past tense since the action hasn't occurred yet but is planned, making it \"were going to do.\" Also, \"so we can reuse it\" flows better when rephrased to \"to reuse it.\"\n\nI also need to ensure that the cleaned text is a single paragraph without any line breaks. Proper punctuation like periods and commas should be in place for clarity and readability. \n\nAdditionally, the instruction mentions preserving the original meaning as much as possible, so minimal changes are necessary beyond removing HTML elements. Ensuring that the overall message stays intact is crucial.\n\nAfter processing each part, I'll compile the sentences together, ensuring they form a coherent whole without any unnecessary elements or formatting. This approach will meet the user's requirements effectively.\n```\nWe had designed a public auto alignment system. A major thing we were going to do during the offseason was simplify and generalize the code so we could reuse it from year to year!\n```",

This includes notifications like game piece acquired, April tag acquired, auto align complete, or if the game piece is stuck. Such information is valuable for reducing cycle times and quickly identifying issues to adjust the game plan accordingly—like checking if the intake is toast or jammed (e.g., detecting voltage spikes on intake motors), whether we can pivot to the other game piece, if we must play D because we only have a drivetrain now, or if the vision system is malfunctioning and the driver needs to switch to manual mode, etc.\n\n---\n\nThis version preserves all key points from the original text while enhancing clarity and grammar.",

                    "cooked": "As far as “things to build to be able to help lead the team”, I’d try some of the following: Get competent in simulations + Mechanism2D models so you and your team can program without hardware. Simulate and implement a robot of different design and slightly greater complexity than one your team built last season. Implement your existing robot in different ways such as full state machine command oriented partial state machines or just a full re-do if your current code is a disaster. Identify and resolve problems you had last season auto state handling path-planning vision feed-forwards whatever. Or resolve them in different manners than the one you ended up with. That one really cool thing you saw some other team do? Simulate and implement that. Repeat. Or in other words find where your limits currently are and push. Don’t worry about doing things perfectly just pick a thing work at it until you’re satisfied with the result then go do another thing. The goal here is to just diversify your experience but without getting too far away from the problems you’re likely to face next year given the constraints and capabilities of your program. This will help you understand where folks might be struggling when they need help and steer them towards solutions that might be better. Once you have folks up and running then is the time to have folks really dig into crunchier topics and “level up” your program with new technical expertise. For a leadership role practice I’d also suggest finding some local workshop or educational event and help out. When I’ve seen when students step into a leadership one of the tricky points is often figuring out how to answer questions and identify where folks struggle. Those beginner “learn to X” workshops are a great way to see folks struggle on “trivial” things and give you a number of opportunities to figure out how to identify what their issue is and get them moving past it without doing it for them. Plus this is a lot of fun and you’ll meet some great people doing it.",
