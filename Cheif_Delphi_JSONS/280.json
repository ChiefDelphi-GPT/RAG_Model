Learning the programming language can be done with plenty of resources and YouTube tutorials, but robot code is the challenging part. The best way I learnt this is just by getting a lot of experience with trial and error. And that’s one thing we plan to include for our following year: give the new students projects to do and try to get them to solve it on their own. Projects like purposely adding bugs in the code, and have the students try to figure out the solution. Our team has 2 programming mentors, but you guys could definitely do this on your own.\n\nAnother thing we are doingthis year, to help keep things organized, is creating a document with a step by step instructions for learning. Something like 1. Learn Python basics, 2. Learn OOP with Python, 3. Learn robot components, etc. This gives a clear way for you to keep track of what stage students are, and help students know what they could do to learn, if they wish to learn on their own.",

                    "cooked": "This may be a bit long since I have a lot to say on the topic. But, the tldr is that Python is a much more well-suited language than Java for the nature of FRC .\n\nLet me preface this by saying that I’m a big fan of Java, I think that it’s a really useful language once you get past its quirks and general verbosity. But, all that said, I’m pretty sure that Java was chosen as the de facto language for FRC solely because of AP CSA since it really doesn’t make sense to use it as a robotics language. The big draw of Java is the JVM and cross-platform compatibility, but that is useless when every frc program is run on the same platform, all the JVM really does in this case is add unnecessary bloat.\n\nFurthermore, the explicitness, and often daunting syntax, of Java really doesn’t help it in this regard either. FRC is already a time crunch and team’s generally underestimate the amount of time needed to create a robot, so programming is even more of a time crunch. So having to explicitly type and lay out the privacy of every variable and excessively long import statements don’t really help out much with short development times and really only adds extra stress. As much flack as dynamic typing gets, it is still really useful when you are trying to write up a quick script before competition, and honestly just setting you’re type checker to strict fixes 99% of the issues with dynamic typing.\n\nComparing Python to Java. It’s just a way, way better language to develop time-constrained robotics programs in. It’s already commonly used on raspberry pi’s, so anyone with prior robotics-programming related experience will probably know a thing or two about the language. Also, since robotpy wraps around the C libraries, performance time really isn’t as big a deal as people make it out to be.\n\nPackage management and load times are also much better on python than java, even with base pip, and virtual environments and newer tools like uv make stuff so much more straightforward. Also the command-line repl prompt is amazing for ensuring parts of your code works while working on it allowing you to be even more efficient while scripting.\n\nAlso zooming out from just robots for a second. Python is also way more useful than Java for other stuff in FRC , especially scouting. There’s a reason why Python is the most popular language in data science. Having the ability to open up a Jupyter Notebook and immediately jump to data visualization with very little relative effort is amazing and having programmers who can do that and code a robot while only needing to know one language is even more so and makes the overall team much more flexible.\n\nAgain sorry if this was a bit long. I also want to reiterate that this isn’t an attack against Java, I think it’s an amazing and useful language, just not for the current environment of FRC .\n\nAnd with that, thank you all for listening to my ted talk.",

So here’s our approach:\n\nUnfortunately there has to be that one person to do all the work like learn themselves with no help, then be expected to make a curriculum from the most common knowledge thing like creating private or public variables, all the way to how to integrate your finished code onto the electronics. Unfortunately that had to be me to do so. Because our programming team is so small I had no other choice but to make one since we can’t spend our time in season teaching the rookies.\n\nIs a lesson/curriculum plan better than manual? Not in my opinion but that’s all we can do until programming gets bigger.\n\nWe use java, so unfortunately it would be no help if I gave you that curriculum. Wish you the best of luck though!",

Not only are many vendor libraries not supported in Python, but even WPIlib is not fully integrated yet. In my mind this makes Java a much more valuable language in FRC , even with the pitfalls of compile time and the difficult learning curve.",

Conversely, if you spend a lot of time focusing on WPILib and the more niche genre of hardware programming, what language features (if any) do you omit?\n\nI imagine that this is very heavily dependent on the previous knowledge of students, so let’s say this question refers to brand-new programmers.",

I agree with the rest of your post though, and python is better in many ways than java for frc. But for using complex vision systems and auto alignment, python simply cannot keep up.",

I’ve found that the most successful approach relies on two key principles.\n\nFirst, it’s essential to let the rookies face challenges independently, particularly when working in pairs or small groups. Allowing them to troubleshoot and solve problems on their own builds confidence and problem-solving skills.\n\nSecond, provide clear, specific goals, whether through structured projects or targeted reviews of learning materials. This creates a clear benchmark for progress and gives them a focused path toward mastery.\n\nPersonally, I learned from just observing the trained programmers and asking questions, but the biggest “jump” is by having experience don’t he robot.",

We try to use more of our time getting students hands on experience, rather than give them a lecture about a programming language, which could easily be learnt at a student’s own time. I in fact only knew the basics of Python and haven’t touched OOP at all, but just getting experience with the robot code was enough to essentially teach me all about it. The experience mixed with Google searches from time to time is where most of my language for Python comes from. Similarly, I learnt most of Java just by reading other people’s code.",

                    "cooked": "If your team can swing it, I’d encourage your veteran students to make an explicit goal to focus away from coding and more toward documenting, process setting, and training.\n\nWhat you lose it technical capability from an experienced student doing chunks of work quickly, you gain in mentor value. What they lose in time to develop further technical skills, they more than gain in soft skills and good communication strategies. We try to emphasize a “mini-mentor” approach to our seniors, and the ones who really make an effort here really benefit long term.\n\nA local team (SteelRidge) apparently ran a number of years (up til 2025) without a code mentor, with their students building the curriculum for training additional students. It was actually so good it inspired our team to do a full overhaul of our process to steal their ideas. Talking with other local teams and borrowing what they do is absolutely a viable strategy, and one they’ll likely be happy to help with.\n\nIf it’s helpful, here’s our (relatively early stage) curriculum and documentation inspired by working with them. https://stormbots.github.io/KnowledgeBase/\n\nOur goal here is very much provide a pathway from knowing nothing to “coding X thing” without having to slog through unrelated concepts. The WPILib docs are awesome, but that’s the biggest pain point we’ve seen when our students are trying to self educate. Building on that roadmap is the core we stole from Steelridge: Having a small list of action items to demonstrate a minimal level of mastery on each topic. The combination should give us a pretty flexible curriculum with clear documentation written for the knowledge level of a student, regardless of how they ended up there. And if they want something specific, they can work backward to get the prerequisites.",
