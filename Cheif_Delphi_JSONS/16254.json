Assuming a budget of 5K and a need to spend a few hundred of it to build an enclosure to keep monkeys out, what printer would be most useful for a mid resource FRC team?\n\nAssume we can get reasonable quantities of filament outside the grant structure.  Priority on durability and on the ability to use multiple filament types.  It would be used in season for the FRC team, off season in our summer programming, and for supervised use by the school generally.\n\nMarkforged?  Something else?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n5826",

If not, that’s probably a good thing to consider, since the filament cost will be kinda high on the Markfordged. Think Ender 3 or Prusa mini . Those printers are going to save you money in the long run, if you can use cheap PLA for prototypes, and then use the CF nylon for your final copy.\n\nUnfortunately the Markfordged will only run their Onyx filament, but from what I understand will be fairly fuss-free compared to other options. If your goal is Carbon Fiber, this is probably the way to go.\n\nNow if you are set on wanting multiple materials, Maybe consider a couple Prusa I3 MK3S+s or a Prusa XL. They can do CF Nylon (with a hardened nozzle). They would have more fuss if you are running CF Nylon, but it would open up nearly all materials.\n\nYou could also run the new CF polycarbonate blend Prusament makes, which would be pretty strong in many applications. That is, if it ever comes back in stock. (I managed to get a spool, and really liked it)",

Carbon Fiber aside, it’s by far the most precise/accurate 3D printer we have, and we’ll use it for parts we need to “just work” like pulleys and even spur gears (low-torque only, of course).\n\nNow that said, you pay for that accuracy and durability in $$$ and time (it’s relatively slow compared to most printers) so it definitely wouldn’t be my first choice for a 3D printer if you’re just getting into it.\n\nSometimes you need accuracy and durability, and sometimes you just need a workhorse that can pump out parts on the cheap. I use my own printer (an old Robo3D R1+) to make a TON of parts for my team out of eSun PLA+ , including almost all of our 2020/2021 turret/shooter mechanism. It lacks the dimensional accuracy and durability of a Markforged part, but I can print parts in less than 1/4 the time, and with some tuning, can get enough accuracy and durability for most purposes, plus it’s cheap enough to operate that you can easily make spares.\n\nIf you don’t already have a 3D printer, go for something like a Prusa i3 , or, if you can afford to wait till summer, the Prusa XL (personally I’d avoid the Mini), which will give you a lot more flexibility (due to the larger build volume) and the ability to make a lot more parts cheaply.\n\nThat said if you already have other 3D printers, and are prepared for the running costs, a Markforged is an excellent machine to have.",

As this would be “our” printer but living in the school we would make it available to students outside the program if we can train them in.  And use it for classes we run.  I think a certain number of spools of carbon could be part of the deal.  We would also be very happy to run parts for the rookie team down the road.\n\nBut as others have said, it might not make the most sense to go straight to this option.  The run time point is also germane.  Walking away from this thing while it works is not appealing.\n\nT",

This seems like a more important problem to solve.\n\nLike others have said, if carbon fiber nylon is the end goal then a markforged is the move, but is not being able to print high performance filament the most important problem?\n\nFor our team we find that lack of available printers to be our biggest limiting factor in 3d printing. If our few printers are all running parts at a meeting that won’t finish until after we leave, we can’t start more parts until the next meeting. This slows down iteration and is more of a problem that not being able to print carbon fiber nylon.",

Last time we tried to use the three survivors one needed calibration and one had a broken fan. One worked.\n\nA case could be made for us to buy a pair of Prusas just for our use and guard them carefully.\n\nWe are basically a community team existing in a school space, so our interaction with “the day shift” is not extensive.\n\nT",

We could round out the package with some other things we will use going forward.  Our video efforts have stalled a bit since a recent graduation, so a camera, tripod, maybe laptop dedicated to that.  We still have severe issues with storage space…but I’ve concluded that a complete lack of reported space is never actually that way.  Workspaces are like the TARDIS…\n\nIt may be that a few of the defunct, dusty, old 3D printers now occupying valuable real estate will disappear.\n\nMeeting today, we will undertake a census of functional printers.\n\nT",

For printing the tougher engineering grade filaments, an elevated chamber temperature is required. Especially for large prints. There are many enclosed printers on the market that while they do not have active heated chambers, the heat from the bed can heat the chamber. Creality  has a line of enclosed printers for example.  We now have a actively heated chamber printer. This has opened up reliable large prints in nylon, nylon CF and true polycarbonate. We recently printed a swerve plate for testing and have found that PC is almost as stiff as the PA6 CF same plate. After I let the students beat it up, the PC plate is in good shape, the PA CF is warped. The PC plate was printed at 70c chamber 280 hot end and 110 build plate. PEI bed with PC adhesive. I would spend some money on a printer that can meet these requirements.",
