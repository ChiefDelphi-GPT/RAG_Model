                    "cooked": "Hello Everyone!\n\nI’m one of the code captains from team 2875, and we are very excited to announce the full release of our team’s open-source swerve-drive focused library, SwoLib ! Contrasting with most swerve libraries, SwoLib does NOT wrap WPILib SwerveDriveKinematics , or any other WPILib swerve-related classes. Instead, SwoLib’s swerve utilities are based on custom-built kinematics, odometry, autonomous, pathplanning software, and math classes.\n\nSwoLib, however, is not just a swerve drive library. SwoLib contains utilities and wrapper classes for various pieces of hardware, including (but not limited to!) Limelights, motors & controllers (Falcon500, NEO, etc), gyros (Pigeon, NavX), encoders, and much more. SwoLib is also Kotlin based, allowing teams who program in Kotlin to take advantage of the language’s various higher-level features, but also boasting full compatibility with Java.\n\nAs for the swerve drive related parts of the library, SwoLib includes built-in odometry to track the position of the robot on the field in 2 or 3d space. This odometry can also (optionally) be integrated with SwoLib’s limelight to automatically correct for any drift with 2023’s AprilTags.\n\nArguably the most distinct aspect of SwoLib is its fully dynamic autonomous capabilities. Thanks to the aforementioned AprilTag-based positioning, a robot employing SwoLib’s autonomous utilities is capable of starting anywhere on the field and following the same predefined paths. SwoLib performs motion-profiling and path calculations at runtime. The paths are composed of a list of waypoints which can be generated from our own modified version of pathplanner (open source and linked in the SwoLib repository). This allows the robot to discern its position on the field using a Limelight + AprilTags and then move to the correct starting position when the autonomous period begins! Not only can this be applied in autonomous, but also in the teleop period too! Team 2875 uses this to automatically position our robot to place cones/cubes (in teleop), and we are capable of beginning this automatic positioning from anywhere on the field!\n\nFor more information, please check out the GitHub repository (linked above) example projects (found in the repository) and the extensive SwoLib documentation . Please feel free to reach out with any questions!\n\nPS - Apologies for making you search for links. As a new account, Chief Delphi limited me to two links in this post.",

Instead i would recommend working with the creator to try to get your changes into a PR.\n\nYour commands look really nice too!",

Last year, our team used NEOs with CANSparkMaxes and 775 motors controlled from VictorSPXs, so we decided to make sure SwoLib is usable with any type of motor/controller. In the future we may add the option for teams who wish to use built in PIDs.\n\nI didn’t even realize the telemetry wasn’t optional! Thank you for pointing that out, I will fix that.\n\nAs for the generic vision pose estimating, I like that idea! In the future, we will add that.\n\nI’m not sure why we use separate interfaces for driving and turning motors; I believe the reason for that got lost in some refactor. I will make sure we update that to a single interface.\n\nAs for the PathPlanner, our customizations are solely in the output JSON (pretty much an added toJSON function) to output solely the waypoints without the excess data. In the future, we may switch to a simple script to parse the default pathplanner JSON into our form. We didn’t want to parse it at runtime to maintain as much performance as possible.\n\nAgain, thank you so much for these suggestions. Our code team is mentor-less (all students), so you have been incredibly helpful!",
