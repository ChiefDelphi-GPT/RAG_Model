A few days ago, we received our unit, and after seeing other teams start blog threads to share their testing, we decided to do the same.\n\n06 July – First Steps (Mostly Electrical)\n\nThe first time we played around with the System Core, it was mostly on the electrical side. We got some of the Molex connectors and wanted to see how crimping them feels. Since we already crimp almost all of our cables, it made sense to give it a try.\n\nWe used the same crimp tool we use for PWM connectors, and it worked fine.\n\nSome quick notes about the connectors:\n\nThe Molex connectors are keyed, so you have to pay attention to the order you insert the wires.\n\nThey don’t release as easily as the PWM ones we’re used to.\n\nThey’re more expensive than the PWM ones.\n\nThe old PWM connectors work in the Molex ports.\n\nWe also made a simple adapter plate so we could mount the System Core using the same holes as the roboRIO.\n\nwe added labels to all the ports and LEDs.\n\nAfter wiring everything up, we powered it on for the first time, mostly just to see the screen and LEDs light up.\n\nIMG_9919 1920×2560 358 KB IMG_9929 1920×2560 161 KB IMG_0051 1920×2560 452 KB\n\nIMG_9919 1920×2560 358 KB\n\nIMG_9919 1920×2560 358 KB\n\nIMG_9929 1920×2560 161 KB\n\nIMG_9929 1920×2560 161 KB\n\nIMG_0051 1920×2560 452 KB\n\nIMG_0051 1920×2560 452 KB",

For some reason, it didn’t work on that machine. Luckily, we managed to update it to Alpha 4 through another computer.\n\nAfter the update, we connected a Falcon motor. We tested it first on CAN bus 0 everything we tried worked fine. Then we tried moving it to other CAN buss also was fine. Next, we wanted to try using a REV magnetic limit switch as a digital input. That didn’t seem to work. We’re going to start a conversation about the Smart I/O ports to understand what’s expected of them in this stage.\n\nAfter failing with the REV limit switch, we just used stripped wires instead, that worked! so we got musical video\n\nFinally, we tried connecting LED Strip, but we didn’t manage to get that working. The robot code keeps crashing when we try. IMG_0092 1920×1440 314 KB\n\nIMG_0092 1920×1440 314 KB\n\nIMG_0092 1920×1440 314 KB",

How did you have it wired?\n\nSame as we would to connect the RoboRio. I did not take a picture of the wiring. The LED on it did light up, but no signal. video image 622×492 29.4 KB\n\nimage 622×492 29.4 KB\n\nimage 622×492 29.4 KB",

They are excited to work with no radio. video\n\nAbout the Sensor Issue After looking at the problem from yesterday again, looks like we need to use a 4.7 kilo-ohm pull-down resistor. Right now, the only one we have on hand is 120 ohm, so we’ll acquire the correct one and give that a try.\n\nWe also tried working with the beam break sensor we like. Same story as the REV magnetic limit switch.\n\nOn the other hand, we tested the Time-of-Flight LiDAR distance sensor that we like, and it seems to work fine with the System Core.\n\nAbout the Update Issue We also looked into the update issue from yesterday, tried again, and shared it in the Git.",

Looks to me like the pull-down inside the systemcore is pulling the DIO down (as seen by the DIO changing state when being shorted to high with the bare wires), so it’s always reading low, even before the Hall effects are triggered by the magnet. You can confirm by measuring the voltage on the sense pin without the limit switch being triggered.\n\nThe roborio has pull-up (rather than pull-down) resistors on the DIO, so that was not a problem.",

The students will try to explain and describe the issue better and upload it to the Git if it happens again.\n\nWe plan on connecting it to our 2023 robot in the coming days!",
