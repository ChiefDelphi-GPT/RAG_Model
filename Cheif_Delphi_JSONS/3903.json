Now whenever we select the “Open New Window” or we just cloes and reopen VS code (using the WPI shortcut) an error messeage pops up and says “This exstention is not supported use the WPI installer” and the ability to use any commands that relates to WPI has been lost. For now when ever that happens we have to reinstall it, then it works the first time we open VS code but after the same thing happens. We have already got rid of any instances of WPI and the stand alone verion VS code and tried dowloading it again with the same result. Please tell us what we are doing wrong.",

If you are on a Windows Device you can follow the instructions in this article, or read what is pasted below (they are the same thing I have just pasted it here on the off chance you get a firewall, or run into a school web blocker, and future accessibility purposes). If nothing shows up in either of those methods than VS code is fully uninstalled and you can proceed with the WPI installer.\n\nWindows 11\n\nSelect Start [the Windows icon on the bottom of the screen] > All apps and search for the app in the list shown.\n\nPress and hold (or right-click) on the app, then select Uninstall .\n\nUninstall in Settings\n\nSelect Start > Settings > Apps > Installed apps .\n\nFind the app you want to remove, select More > Uninstall .\n\nNote: Some apps can’t be uninstalled from the Settings app right now. For help uninstalling these apps, follow the instructions to uninstall from Control Panel.\n\nUninstall from Control Panel\n\nIn search on the taskbar, enter Control Panel and select it from the results.\n\nSelect Programs > Programs and Features.\n\nPress and hold (or right-click) on the program you want to remove and select Uninstall or Uninstall / Change . Then follow the directions on the screen.\n\nWindows 10\n\nUninstall from the Start menu\n\nSelect Start and look for the app or program in the list shown.\n\nPress and hold (or right-click) on the app, then select Uninstall .\n\nUninstall from the Settings page\n\nSelect Start [the Windows icon on the bottom of the screen] , then select Settings > Apps > Apps & features .\n\nSelect the app you want to remove, and then select Uninstall .\n\nUninstall from the Control Panel (for programs)\n\nIn the search box on the taskbar, type Control Panel and select it from the results.\n\nSelect Programs > Programs and Features.\n\nPress and hold (or right-click) on the program you want to remove and select Uninstall or Uninstall / Change .
