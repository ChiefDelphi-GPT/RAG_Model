While looking at successful intake designs, I noticed teams like 254 and 1323 have a ‘funnel’ feature to their intake, allowing for a more effective touch-own of Power Cubes.\n\nFor teams who had these kinds of intakes, I had two questions about your design process:\n\nWhat angle (shown in the image below) did you go with?\n\nWhat prototyping process did you use to decide on this angle?",

Rather than choosing a specific angle that worked, we wanted to determine at what angle did a particular design NOT work.  By identifying the extremes we then translated that into design constraints that could be integrated with packaging considerations.  The optimal angle was then found via iteration over the course of the season (there’s a picture somewhere of the 8 or so sets of intake plates we went through).\n\nIt also helped that we identified pretty early on (the day after kickoff I think?) that we wanted to intake cubes at any angle in any orientation, and be able to either eject them in a direction or drop them from above.\n\nOur oversight in prototyping that year was neglecting to consider that the interaction between the intake and cube went differently when either or both of them were on the platform surface or the ramp, so our lesson learned from that year was to include less than optimal arrangements of robots and game pieces in parameterization, and also make sure to test all the surfaces that we’ll encounter on the field.  Also, we only had a wood platform and not the field official material (HDPE?  I don’t recall what it was) which had a different interaction with the cover that was a bit of a surprise at our first event, so the following season we invested in the field specific material for early prototyping.",

I suspect that is what you’re seeing in these west coast intakes as well - my memory is that they used smaller wheels for packaging and to fit more contact points into the mechanism, so they made the outermost wheel wider to increase the intake’s range. The overall width seemed to be determined based on what would fit through their elevators.\n\nCompliance in your intake and/or wheels should account for all cube orientations. I’d definitely recommend having some sort of system to “solve” diagonal cubes on the fly, which can be as simple as a passive curved piece of plastic at the back of the intake, or as complex as current monitoring on the intake wheels.",

We found that a single pair of wheels worked better, and did not depend on which way the cube was oriented (one side was shorter than the other).\n\nThe secret was that the “claw” holding the wheels was held “soft closed” by a reduced air pressure cylinder, such that it would open up as the wheels intaked the sides and corners of the cube.  Since we used the same claw for lifting the cube, we used a separate solenoid valve to increase the pressure for a “hard grip”.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Coh4LwNu2Yc?t=27",
