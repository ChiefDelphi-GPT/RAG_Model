Currently the CANdles built in LEDs display red, white, and pink of three of the LEDs, and the LED strip itself is a plethora of colors in an irregular pattern. By this I mean that half of the LEDs are off and the others are random colors. We are rather stumped because we followed the documentation and encountered errors. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",

There are many different options like WRGB GBR etc. You can try setting it with candle.configLEDType(LEDStripType.*); If you are seeing “random” colors that might mean your code is sending out 4 bytes of data (WRGB) rather than 3 (RGB) or something like that.\n\nAlso, have you confirmed that you have the correct number of LEDs chosen if you are using any animations?\n\nFinally, it’s also worth checking that any metal contacts on the back of external LED strips aren’t shorted. My team bought some LED lights for the CANdle and we accidentally shorted out a small section by sticking them on metal, causing “random” colors to appear further down the strip.",

We have them set to GRB in the code as well as in the config for the CANdle on Phoenix Tuner X.\n\nI have currently not run any animations through, just solid colors. But I do not know how many segments are on the LED, which is definitely an issue. Is the segment count just how any LEDs are on the strip?\n\nI will definitely make sure the first thing I do next meeting is check for shorts. It would really suck if this were the case because we just received them from CTRE yesterday, and today was the first time they have been used. I will look for shorts then check all the code, then ill test other LEDs.\n\nAgain thank you for the response, its very helpful to see all the ways we can trouble shoot this.",

They don’t look like it but are very fragile and we got breakage turning corners of the robot structure. We fixed the breaks and tested and had another break to fix.\n\nIf the CANdle isn’t working right with no LEDs plugged into it (except its internal ones) then that sounds like you are trying to use a 5 volt supply instead of the 12 v supply to the CANdle.\n\nConsider possible CAN wiring trouble.\n\nNeeding an extra power supply on the LEDs and then overheating sounds like a break in the string and then using the wrong voltage boost to bypass the break or reverse polarity wiring errors.\n\nArrow on LEDs goes away from the CANdle as already mentioned.\n\nThe CANdle is rated for 6 A 5V output and our LED string was significantly less than that but the CANdle quit working. The next day it recovered but clearly the one we got can’t handle even 5 A on the 5 V output.\n\nMake sure your LEDs are plugged into the right voltage. All of my team’s are 5V but I see 12V strings are available.",
