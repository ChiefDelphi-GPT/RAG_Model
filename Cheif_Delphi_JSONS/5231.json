We have ran the PDP 1 for a handful of years, but since we started using swerve, we’ve ran into issues with not having enough large power ports for the rest of our motors. I looked at the CTR page and saw that there is a PDP 2.0, but there doesn’t seem to be any CAN ports. I also looked at the REV PDH and have heard a few teams have issues with using it. Do we just stick to using the PDP 1 or go with a new PDP ?",

Can’t speak to the construction or internals yet without having one, but CTRE is usually solid there\n\nBeing able to have connectors exit on only 2 sides can be nice for packaging.\n\nNo dedicated location for rio or radio / peripherals, rules for how this will work are unknown, but these will likely require 2 of these outputs.\n\nAssuming the above, 22 40A motors allowed compared to 20 on the PDH , there’s also some lower current ports you can use for motors with the PDH (switchable ones).\n\nNo CAN on PDH means you’ll need to rely on your own logging vs DS logs to see motor current, this will make CSAs less able to help you if you don’t do logging well.\n\nRequires you to terminate the bus separately from the PDH\n\nPDP 2 is $45 cheaper",

Dan K helped me diagnose it in the pit, but it was tough as nails to find. If we hit the skid plate really hard right below the PDP the crack would disconnect temporarily and force the bot to reboot.\n\nWe swapped it with a spare from pit admin and then took it apart completely to inspect it. Big big crack across several traces.\n\nThinking back on this was probably during 2016 as we were the 'defense clearer ’ jumping the moat, high beam, etc and slamming back to the ground multiple times a match. We broke lots of parts that year.",

I see quite a few teams that re-use the PDP from their rookie kit every year (or the 2015 kit if the team is older than that); in fact, it’s common enough for that to be one of the things I look for first when helping investigate mysterious reboots now, as the mini fuses required for the RIO and radio tend to be worn out and loose on the older PDPs that have been used year after year.\n\nI don’t think PDH usage is anywhere above 80% in my district, and I would guess it’s closer to 70%. That said, it is my preferred panel to work with. I’ve only seen one PDH -related failure actually give a team a power problem during a match, and that was from under-stripped 6 AWG main power wires making poor contact, heating up, and melting everything around it inside until the connection broke. I’ve seen loose screw connections to the PDP more often, which causes its own problems.",

I also much prefer the latching wago connectors on the PDH to the annoying ones on the PDP .\n\nHowever, I do like the idea of screw terminals for the battery connection, I’ve heard of a failure or two from other teams’ PDHs where a poor connection there caused things to get melty. We just always make sure to give the battery wires a strong tug to test their connection.",

Even that is not quite a 100% replacement for some of the data on a PDP1 or PDH .\n\nIf that’s not your team (and that’s a vast majority from what I’ve seen) the lack of CAN bus and per-port load monitoring makes this device a non-starter for me.\n\nToo many times, be it a battery issue, wiring issue, brown-out issue, or something else, I’ve looked at that data to assist a team with an issue. That’s not to say I’ve used it for every issue, but enough of them to say it will be missed. And I don’t want to recommend, or even be neutral about the product if it means I would be missing important data that could help a team.\n\nHence, I do not recommend the product for the vast majority of teams. Those that do use it I would consider advising them to do so at their own risk and with full knowledge of the limitations.\n\nNow, between the PDP1 and PDH , I don’t have a strong opinion. Yes REV did have some issues with one batcho of PDH ’s, the voltage display was incorrect, and yes, the breakers themselves can be tricker to pull, but that is not a major differentiator for me. I have not experienced issues with the switched circuit, but am aware they did exist, in what quantity I can’t say.\n\nI look at the PDP / PDH as the same way I look at PP45s and Wago connectors. If you can correctly strip and insert them fully and properly into a Wago, I believe the PDH has a slight edge. If your team struggled with correctly stripping and inserting wire into a Wago connector, you may have come training/learning to do to reliably wire your PDH as well.\n\nI think the additional ports on the PDH over the PDP are an advantage to teams, especially those running swerve, and should be a factor in your decision.\n\nThose points aside, both products are quality products and both vendors have supported them and I believe will continue to support them fully. I don’t think either of the PDP / PDH is a “wrong” choice.",
