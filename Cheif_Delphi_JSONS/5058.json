                    "cooked": "EricRehder:\n\nHow can multiple sensor estimates of field position be integrated?\n\nThere are many ways. Let’s start by breaking the problem down.\n\nFirst, a single lidar measurement provides a linear distance from the wall, to the pose of the sensor on the field.\n\nThe sensor’s pose is generally assumed to be three components - an X/Y coordinate on the field, and a rotation. WPILib wraps these up into a Pose2d class.\n\nGiven only a single, accurate lidar measurement, there still many possible poses which could have produced that measurement.\n\nYou’ll need some way to constrain down which pose you assume produced the lidar measurement. This could include only trusting the measurement while in a specific are of the field (perhaps, aligned with a side of the reef?). It could also involve adding additional sensors - a gyro, or another lidar for example.\n\nOnce you have the pose you think produced the measurement, it’s important to remember that all measurements have noise. In reality, there’s a pose that most likely produced the measurement, but other poses near by that also might have produced the measurement (with the probability of the pose being the real one dropping off as you get further from the most-likely point).\n\nApplying a filter to the measurement is one way to decrease the impact of this probability - basically, you use multiple measurements to confirm the pose before using it.\n\nGetting multiple measurements requires that you either have faster sensors, more sensors, or wait for for the sensors to supply more data.\n\nIn all cases, as long as the sensors are supplying information in the same reference frame (IE, all produce a Pose2d ) a simple strategy is to take a weighted average of sensors. Pick your weights to represent how much you trust each source of data.\n\nA Kalman Filter (a common recommendation in these cases) takes more steps to formalize this process, also usually including information from your motor power and previous estimates of pose to make an “optimal” guess of current pose.\n\nTwo key Lidar-specific considerations:\n\nThe field walls are made of clear polycarb, which is usually somewhat scuffed up. This can have some unexpected scattering/transmission effects, depending on the wavelength of laser used.\n\nOther robots and field obstacles might block the line of sight from the lidar to the wall.\n\nHaving a strategy for when to or not trust the lidar measurement will be key.\n\nDoes all this sound hard? It definitely is!\n\nIf you’re willing to assume this is an X/Y problem (your real goal is “better pose” and you’ve incorrectly assumed the solution is “add lidar”)…\n\nHave you done root-cause analysis to determine why one dimension is more accurate than the other with apriltags?\n\nWhy not use two apriltag estimates to improve the accuracy?",

I’ve been trying for the last year to get the students to even make the position noise measurements! When looking directly at an April tag the only indicator of distance is the size of the apriltag and that is limited by pixel size&noise. The poor distance estimation was talked a lot with the older limelight2 running at 320x200. This is what our team has. Planning an upgrade but that’s what we have today. The newer cameras/processing power are enabling higher pixel density which will improve precision.\n\nI’ll point to this which shows what I’m talking about\n\nIntroduced in 2024, Megatag2 is a precise and ambiguity-free AprilTag-based localizer for mobile robots. It was built with the following goals:\n\nThe animation after the line “Notice the difference between MegaTag2”. The Red bumper robot is bouncing closer/farther to the apriltag but the lateral position is very steady. That difference in noise is my focus.\n\nWhy not use two apriltag estimates to improve the accuracy? Yes, that would greatly improve accuracy but requires a second camera. We plan to have one camera and in many cases only 1 apriltag is visible in a frame.\n\nIn all cases, as long as the sensors are supplying information in the same reference frame (IE, all produce a Pose2d) a simple strategy is to take a weighted average of sensors. Pick your weights to represent how much you trust each source of data.\n\nYes, but that only works if you have multiple independent Pose2d. What I’m trying to do is a bit different. I will have a distance from the Lidar to a wall near the AprilTag. A camera on the robot will identify the April Tag, the robot distance to the AprilTag, and robot angle to the AprilTag. These are used to determine the Pose2d of the robot (XYR).\n\nIf the robot is fairly close to and facing straight at an April Tag there is large error in the distance to the AprilTag and I wish to use lidar to improve that.\n\nSee my cartoon with the blue robot facing the Apriltag on a wall. The yellow ellipse indicates the noise in the Apriltag XYR position. There will be much larger uncertainty in the robot to Apriltag distance then in the lateral position.\n\nThe lidar info is represented in a green arc with low uncertainty in the distance to the wall/April tag and no knowledge of the lateral position. The comments about lidar uncertainty are well taken.\n\nThese sensors appear to complement each other. I’m thinking of combining the data as follows:\n\nIdentify the Apriltag\n\nDetermine the relative angle of camera and robot to April tag\n\nMeasure the lidar distance to the wall/April tag\n\nMake a weighting determination of the Apriltag distance measurement and the lidar distance measurement and combine them.\n\nThen use the Apriltag XYR, angle of the bot, and the distance to determine the robotpose XYR\n\nI’m not very familiar with all the options in WPILib, PhotoVision, etc. I wasn’t sure if there are other, easier ways to combine these data.\n\n[I think the issue is that robotpose is in a cartesian XY coordinate system. But the errors and data I’m concerned about are fundamentally in a cylindrical coordinate system.]",

Additionally, increase the resolution of your apriltag detection (you want it at max resolution, most likely), and make sure you’re correctly passing the latency numbers into the pose estimator.\n\nBased on what you have told me, it is my belief that that line of thinking will bring you the greatest improvement in pose estimation with the least amount of work.",

We never ended up using it, and instead went with a vision based solution with a camera in the driver station.\n\nAs far as finding distance measurements using only vision with april tag detections, you are likely seeing small errors explode with the solve pnp solution that is used for 3d localization in photon vision and limelight implementations. We mitigated this last year by running multiple different pose estimation models (megatag/solvepnp, pinhole using known mounting height of the tag) and using a simple heuristic to decide which (if any) of the vision model outputs to accept into our pose estimator.  The pinhole model should provide a more accurate “distance from tag” at large distances, but does not provide as rich of a signal. IIRC we found megatag2 to be pretty good at close distances, and would use that to seed our localization pose while sitting on the field before auto mode.\n\n(Link to code , see the shouldUseMegatag and shouldUsePinhole calls for the model choosing heuristic logic)",
