I believe the game was a \"software\" game requiring good software or semi-automatic features, possibly using sensors or algorithms.\n\nThe most important aspect was the robot's position alignment, especially to execute quickly.\n\nOur primary strategy involved vision using Limelight 4s and PID control with April Tags for telemetry. We changed from using all April Tags to only those relevant, avoiding issues with different tag placements affecting field setups.\n\nWe needed a tuned swerve drive base for precise positional control, achieving ±3 cm accuracy with PID tuning. During tele-op, we manually positioned the robot near the Reef Face. Front cameras looked for the April Tag; loading the left or right pipe depended on triggers. After updating position, we executed PID-based moves toward the pipe until within tolerance, then scored coral. For auto, we used pathplanning initially, followed by PID-driven commands.\n\nPotential issues with PID tuning caused delays in scoring, prompting questions about faster methods or terminating commands. Our auto program used pathplanning initially, then PID control for the rest.\n\nAn image illustrating the setup is referenced, though it may be removed in further processing.",

We could score L3/L4 out the front and back at that point in the season, so we needed to be able to align both ways.\n\nFor coral scoring we pre-selected one of 12 branches and a level. Based on the level and the heading of the robot, it used one of three maps of branch number to pose (front facing reef, back facing reef, L1 special position).\n\nWe did use closest-side logic for algae removal though. We did this not with viewed AprilTags but by determining which direction the reef-center-to-robot vector was in, and thus which of 6 sectors.\n\nOur pose estimation was constantly running, but was filtered to only reef tags. Future work would be to use a field map for multi-tag estimates that only includes reef tags, so that the other elements are not assumed to be correctly placed. None of our full-robot automation cared about what tags were in view or even that the pose estimation was vision-assisted. The drivetrain just supplied the estimated pose for all needed uses.\n\nOur Step 3 and 4 looked about the same, though for auto we used Choreo paths with normally unnecessary extra auto align at the end. Our teleop align was profiled, but this is not necessary as long as the magnitude of the PID effort is clamped IMO.",

Pressing a bumper directed the robot to either the left or right branch. Despite efforts, several issues emerged, preventing resolution during competition season.\n\nPathfinding proved imprecise because manual creation of each path led to uncertain branch positions. Additionally, the robot's positioning relative to the Limelight affected the driver's ability to navigate accurately, requiring precise alignment to avoid collisions. Movement during pathfinding often resulted in the robot becoming trapped randomly, necessitating manual realignment.\n\nDuring offseason, our objective is to integrate PathPlanner's real-time pathfinding. Tags are used solely for pose estimation, followed by identification of the nearest branch. A generated path leads the robot to this position. Simulation tests suggest this approach works effectively, though verifying path completion remains crucial. This method appears significantly faster and more reliable compared to prior solutions.

Both were filtered to only look at AprilTags at their respective areas and used for global pose estimation based on MegaTag1. Our final approach involved pathfinding to a staging pose, followed by a PID-based alignment to the desired position. Initially, we relied on PID alone, which was sufficient but not highly accurate. Adding a second method improved precision. Pathfinding to a manually created path proved surprisingly effective but included unnecessary acceleration and deceleration. A bot statistician placed us at 11.4 and 13.5 gamepieces without mechanical changes. Our scoring mechanism was limited to L1, affecting how we aligned and captured coral pieces. Our method allowed autonomous navigation anywhere on the field, though real matches often present obstacles. Seeing the reef tag was challenging near our scoring spot, though it was visible from the staging pose.",

The control system works such that the operator chooses the placement level, and the driver navigates the robot to the desired reef location before triggering autonomous coral scoring. For navigation, we developed a custom on-the-fly path generator addressing acceleration and starting velocity concerns. If the robot detects a drivetrain issue, it adjusts the elevation and arm positioning to maintain effective scoring. During testing, this ensured successful coral scoring within the robot and reef proximity. Additionally, an operator-controlled button extends the arm for precise coral retrieval. Our auto alignment system facilitated both coral scoring and efficient path generation during dives.",

We will save the more detailed rundown for our code release, but in general, we started with CTRE Swerve Drivetrain plus Limelight 4 Megatag and PathPlanner on the fly paths. We extensively modified our vision, path planning, and control stacks to achieve the necessary performance. Several improvements we made are likely beneficial to most teams and may eventually be incorporated into upstream libraries. Another notable aspect of our controls stack this year is that a significant portion, particularly the mathematically complex components, was AI generated.",

                    "cooked": "Our cameras moved around a lot during the season but ended up with a pretty simple arrangement that I didn’t see too many other teams using. They looked like this at Houston:\n\nAn image was taken at the Houston location showing the robots and their surroundings.\n\nThe “Front Right” Camera with a 70-degree lens was positioned about 6 inches back from the frame perimeter and pointed forward toward the Reef. This camera updated the robots’ odometry every time it detected two April Tags. The updated global pose was used to generate paths between the robots’ locations and the reef poles, finishing about 4 inches away at a speed of approximately 0.5 meters per second. At our first event, our drivers handled all pathing and alignment manually achieving a peak cycle count of 14 matches. With our second and third events, the drivers assisted with pathing improving the cycle count to about 16 matches. However, there was a drop in performance leading to a decrease in cycles achieved.\n\nThe “Front Left” Camera equipped with a wide-angle fisheye lens centered near the Coral Ejector was used once the robot was within 1 meter of the Reef. This camera helped correct the robot’s position before aligning the Ejector with the target Reef pole. The wide lens ensured accurate tag recognition even when the robot was slightly misaligned. A high trust correction was applied to the single-tag estimates increasing accuracy as the robot approached the Reef. This improved our cycle counts significantly at Houston reaching 17-20 cycles per match effectively eliminating drops related to the Coral stations. Our performance met the kickoff goals placing us among the top 50 teams globally.\n\nThe tech stack included two Arducam cameras controlled by a single Orange Pi 5 connected via Ethernet. The global pose was calculated using Photonvision’s multi-tag solver for Camera 1 and single-tag solver for Camera 2 running on the Pi. Camera 2 utilized the robot’s angle from the Gyro instead of relying on tag detection. The estimated pose was fused with odometry using WPILib’s SwervePoseEstimator, and paths were generated and followed by Pathplanner with additional PID control at the endpoint. AdvantageScope proved indispensable for monitoring and debugging our system.\n\nEventually, our code will be shared on GitHub.",

An operator uses a 4x6 keyboard pad to select specific actions such as branch and level for scoring or algae removal. The end effector has a CANRange sensor for vertical adjustments. Driver commands are executed via press+hold actions; releasing stops the command, returns to stow position, waits for further instructions, and triggers auto-align upon holding a single trigger. Auto-align generates paths on-the-fly, navigating to positions relative to the reef face, adjusting within set thresholds. Processor scoring orients the robot toward the processor, simplifying alignment. Intake systems detect coral stations, with two configurations depending on their proximity. The driver preference is to approach the reef a few feet away for safer auto-alignment. Odometry provides feedback during apriltag detection, allowing confident start times for auto-align. LEDs indicate queued positions and assist in debugging. In summary, Choreo dynamic pathing combined with a CANRange sensor enables precise alignment from various points on the reef with up to 12-inch offsets based on coral placement.",

When modifying Pathplanner, how is the library incorporated—using our own version or including it as a folder in the code repository?

It appears that our auto-paths were implemented using Choreo, while dynamic components were developed using a package named Wayfinder. Here's a portion of the relevant comment:\n\nSwerve setpoint generator that's been passed around numerous times, making it challenging to track down, just know I didn't write most of the logic in this code—I attribute the credit to 254 and mjansen. This function takes a prior setpoint, a desired setpoint, and outputs a new setpoint while respecting all kinematic constraints related to module rotation and wheel velocity/torque. Additionally, it ensures that forces acting on a module's wheels don't exceed the force of friction.",

Someone mentioned \"dynamic trajectory generation,\" which I explained is similar to Pathplanner’s setpoint generator but optimized to avoid creating new objects at runtime. This implementation uses a repulsor field—a concept I adapted from the Children of the Corn project—allowing for dynamic switching between repulsor fields and integration with custom controllers. While I can provide more details, an official code release and documentation are coming soon.",
