No matter how big or small, I want to hear it!\n\nBelow, share anything that your team did software / controls wise that you thought was interesting, innovative, or just plain cool.\n\nI’ll start.

We found that being able to tune the PID values at the motor level, then the PID values for turn at the module level then test from the drivetrain level was super valuable.\n\nFirst we zero the encoders, the REV hex encoder come zero’ed from the factory but there seems to be a +/- 5 degree swing in the units we tested making consistent mounting inadequate. Robot Setup 890×914 150 KB\n\nRobot Setup 890×914 150 KB\n\nRobot Setup 890×914 150 KB\n\nSecond we tune the PID in the motor controller. We have had success with Falcons and Neos. The neos take speed in RPM as a setpoint whereas the falcons are ticks per 100ms, since we started with the neos we do the math in RPM and convert to the specific units needed for the motor controller.

Module 2442×1230 242 KB\n\nModule 2442×1230 242 KB\n\nModule 2442×1230 242 KB\n\nThen we test at the drivetrain level, we really need to make the slew rate limiter constants configurable but that is on our todo list. In this dashboard the user can override the joystick and use the sliders to set precise speeds for testing. We also need to add a checkbox for field oriented drive defaulting to enabled.

                    "cooked": "In 2021, my team decided to implement swerve. After coding the majority of it, I had come to autonomous programs, and was deprived of resources. I tried all sorts of things, but none of them met my fancy.\n\nTherefore, I created my own “path synthesis” program, called “Cougar Course” (our team name is the Krypton Cougars). It first implemented De Castelijau’s algorithm to create a Bezier curve for the robot to follow. We used these in most of the 2021 At-Home Challenges. Here’s a video.\n\nUp here in college, I looked back on that project and decided to take it a step further. What’s unique about Bezier curves is that they use control points that the curve does not necessarily pass through. This means generating accurate, large curves is somewhat difficult without the proper software or time.\n\nTherefore, I began working on parametric spline generation, and it seems to have turned out pretty well! The code you see below generates a parametric equation to fit, technically , any number of points. The math was much more difficult and required an RREF calculator, which I did not display, although I did write. Curves look like the one I have displayed in the GUI, which is displayed during simulations if the user requests (requires a third-party library, matplotlib).\n\nTo sum it up, the code basically finds coefficients for a polynomial that has the given solutions. Note that this is all done parametrically; meaning we do this for both x and y in terms of t . t represents the percentage of the curve which has been completed. With these two equations, I can take the derivative and find the slope at t . Therefore, by using encoders, curve length estimation, and the slope, I can have the swerve drive autonomously follow a path.\n\nI am super proud of all this and appreciate any comments and questions!\n\nAnd yes, we do use Python! I, personally, have written robots in Kotlin, Java, Python, and a language that is currently a secret (not CPP)!\n\nP.S. The graph below consists of these points: [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, -2), (0, -3)]\n\nP.P.S Ignore the comments\n\nexample.pdf (18.8 KB)\n\nMore details can be found, here , at my team’s GitHub!",
