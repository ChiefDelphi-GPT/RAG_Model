                    "cooked": "Hi everyone,\n\nIt’s my pleasure to announce the newest products from Grapple Robotics that we’re announcing at champs this year. But first, I’d like to announce that from today, Grapple Robotics will be partnering with The Thrifty Bot!\n\nIMG_0085 2796×1290 365 KB\n\nIMG_0085 2796×1290 365 KB\n\nIMG_0085 2796×1290 365 KB\n\nReally, it comes down to four things:\n\nGrapple will stock The Thrifty Bot parts in our Australian store (starting with the most popular / critical components, and then expanding to a larger catalogue)\n\nThe Thrifty Bot will stock Grapple parts in their US store (which means cheaper shipping for the majority of teams!)\n\nGrapple and Thrifty will co-develop a select range of future products\n\nGrapple and Thrifty electronics products will be cross-compatible (i.e. Grapple and Thrifty CAN products will show up in GrappleHook, and follow a shared CAN specification)\n\nWe’ll be stocking each other’s components in our stores in the coming months, so stay tuned!\n\n(Also, Grapple is still looking to stock other vendor’s parts in Australia – if you’re a vendor and haven’t seen an email from me yet, drop me a line!)\n\nUnfortunately, I personally will not be at champs this year – however, The Thrifty Bot folks will be, and they’ll have our new products on show, including those mentioned below! Go check out their booth and see if you can spot these in the wild and get hands-on.\n\nWe’re re-releasing the LaserCAN, now with an ESD-safe case developed by our friends at Thrifty, ready for deployment on your robots! For those in the US, these will be in stock in Thrifty’s store soon, where you can benefit from in-country shipping rates!\n\nNew for the 2024 offseason is the MitoCANdria – a smart dual-rail power regulator ready for your robots. The MitoCANdria is perfect for powering single-board computers (like the Raspberry Pi, Orange Pi, or NVIDIA Jetson), LED strips, and more! The MitoCANdria features:\n\nLever-action WAGOs for input and output rails, locking Molex SL connectors for CAN\n\nVertical-entry USB and Output connectors to decrease horizontal footprint\n\n4.5V – 14V input voltage range (7.5V – 14V continuous, 4.5V – 20V transient)\n\n120W continuous, 150W transient power output\n\nApprox. 125mm x 50mm (~5x2in)\n\n90%+ Efficiency at full load\n\nCurrent monitoring on every channel\n\n2x 5V switchable channels, 2x 5V non-switchable USB Type C channels (5A per channel, up to 10A shared)\n\n1x 15V – 24V adjustable, switchable channel (5A limit) – configurable over CAN\n\nDual-rail output filtering built for FRC\n\nNote: we’re still validating the power rating and efficiency numbers of the MitoCANdria – these numbers are preliminary based off a prototype revision. The below image is also slightly newer than the model on display at champs and is physically smaller.\n\nIMG_0086 2334×1097 250 KB\n\nIMG_0086 2334×1097 250 KB\n\nIMG_0086 2334×1097 250 KB\n\nOur partners at Thrifty are designing a case for the MitoCANdria, and we will be looking at getting these in the hands of some select teams for beta testing within the next month. Once we’re sure they can withstand the punishment of FRC , we’ll be releasing them for purchase!\n\nAlso new for the 2024 offseason is the FlexiCAN – a 37.5x37.5mm (~1.5x1.5in) board designed to be a flexible core module for any number of carrier devices. On the bottom of the FlexiCAN are a pair of mezzanine connectors that connect it to a carrier device of your choice – an LED matrix, an Arduino-style breakout, or a custom board designed by your team or other vendors.\n\n37.5x37.5mm package\n\nCAN FD and CAN 2.0 compatible (future-proof)\n\nUser-programmable in several languages\n\n5.5V – 18V input voltage\n\nRegulated 5V @ 1A rail provided to the carrier board\n\nUSB- CAN Bridge Support with GrappleHook (open standard)\n\nThe FlexiCAN runs a lightweight WASM interpreter, allowing users to upload their own code while letting the FlexiCAN handle low-level peripherals. You can target WASM from JavaScript, C++, Rust, and more! For official Grapple carrier boards (like the LED Matrix), you can also go purely with the software built into the FlexiCAN’s firmware without having to write your own software.\n\nIMG_0087 1232×1181 205 KB\n\nIMG_0087 1232×1181 205 KB\n\nIMG_0087 1232×1181 205 KB\n\nCurrently, we have two carrier boards – an LED Matrix, and a general Breakout. The LED matrix uses a set of 14x WS2812B LEDs, exposing the full gamut of brightness and colour to the user. The in-built LEDs require no additional power regulation circuitry to function, and additional compatible WS2812B-based LED strips can be attached to the on-board JST connector, which can be snipped off if unused (note: this JST connector does not provide power).\n\nIMG_0088 1226×1138 175 KB\n\nIMG_0088 1226×1138 175 KB\n\nIMG_0088 1226×1138 175 KB\n\nWe have more carrier boards planned (Arduino-compatible breakout, physical autonomous selector to name a few), but we’d love to hear your ideas! If you have an idea for a carrier board, let us know – who knows, maybe we’ll make it!\n\nDon’t worry – we’ll have even more products ready for the 2025 season. This is but a sneak peek\n\nBest,\n\nJaci",

For the MitoCANdria you mention transient input range of 4.5-14V, but especially with the latest brushless motors, voltage transients can be over 16V or higher. And in the case of no battery teams have been reporting frying Limelights with these transients. Is 14V the final number, or would you consider a higher input voltage range?",

Seems like a big step towards a open and cross-compatible FRC CAN standard.\n\nJaci:\n\nThe FlexiCAN runs a lightweight WASM interpreter, allowing users to upload their own code while letting the FlexiCAN handle low-level peripherals. You can target WASM from JavaScript, C++, Rust, and more!\n\nOne could dream that this tech eventually ends up in an FRC -legal motor controller\n\nWill the firmware for FlexiCAN and MitoCANdria be open source?",

Seems like a big step towards a open and cross-compatible FRC CAN standard.\n\nWe are working on a proposal regarding an open CAN standard designed specifically for FRC - hoping to share more soon\n\nMax_Morehead:\n\nWill the firmware for FlexiCAN and MitoCANdria be open source?\n\nSince the MitoCANdria and FlexiCAN are joint products between Grapple and Thrifty, this is still something we’re figuring out. At the very least, we will definitely be sharing our CAN infrastructure in the open source domain (including messaging formats, fragmentation/defragmentation, etc). For the FlexiCAN, there will be a WASM stack that will be open-sourced to allow teams to build whatever code they like on top of the FlexiCAN’s base.",

The FlexiCAN will also behave like a CAN FD ↔ USB bridge like the CANivore, but will be open to all vendors, but it will ultimately be up to their API whether they support it or not.",
