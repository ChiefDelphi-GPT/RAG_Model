                    "cooked": "We have a raspberry pi camera, the ones with a flexy cable. When connecting it to our rpi with an older sd card that has an older version of wpilibpi (not sure which one, around 2022-early 23) the camera works great, and we can read from it, at very high speeds too. When swapping out that sd for a new install of the latest wpilibpi tho, the frame cannot be read. This isnt a code problem as even with a barebones test that does only that, the “ret” returns false and “Frame” is None. Both are run on the same pi, and Cap.isOpened returns true. The problem is specific to this type of camera, as when connecting a usb camera it works with no issues. If anyone has any insight on how to solve this, or a different approach to the problem, both would be welcome. Currently have tried using the picamera2 library but the fps is about half what it was with opencv on the other card (30-40 instead of 60-70). Might be helpful to note that both sd cards have very similar specs, the one with the new wpilibpi is even slightly better.",

Earlier this evening, I uploaded the config.txt from a Pi that we have working with a camera using WPILibPi version 2023.2.1 (the latest). config.txt (2.7 KB)\n\nThe main thing to change/verify is the correct image sensor for the camera you want to use is selected. See this block in config.txt:\n\n#dtoverlay=imx219,media-controller=0 #dtoverlay=imx290,clock-frequency=74250000,media-controller=0 #dtoverlay=imx290,clock-frequency=37125000,media-controller=0 #dtoverlay=imx378,media-controller=0 #dtoverlay=ov5647,media-controller=0 #dtoverlay=ov9281,media-controller=0 dtoverlay=imx296\n\nUncomment / add the image sensor for the camera you want to use.\n\nAs for reading images, you will need to go with picamera2, as you noted.

The wierd thing is that the camera we are using (picam 1.3) was still commented but was working just not very fast. For some reason there is an fps cap by default, although it didnt look like it as the fps was jumping around from 30-40 and even 40+ at times, but by raising the fps cap the fps went back to how it was originally. The line that fixed the fps is below: picam2.set_controls({“FrameRate”: 90})",
