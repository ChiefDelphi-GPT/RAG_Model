During the summer, we plan to test our cadders by having them design a whole robot based around an old challenge or cadding out parts or mechanisms (Elevator, Arm, etc.). Obviously it is more biased and easier for our team as many mechanical members for us experience an Intro to Engineering class where they learn to CAD. However, for your team, if they are interested in learning, I would immerse them into a project or at least teach the main fundamentals of designing.",

Decent amount of hours you need to set aside.\n\nIt’s been a real challenge and learning experience for me because it’s something I didn’t know how to do beforehand. It took a lot of mentorship saying “hey this can be improved because ‘x’ and ‘y’” and also just reiteration and testing.\n\nThe best way to learn CAD nonetheless is real world settings. There are mini competitions called CAD-athons teams like 2485 Overclocked run that involve the release of a “game” and you race to CAD a robot based on that. It’s a very nice project. Immersing people straight in the experience starting from like a priority list, block CAD ideation, and then actually going out to make mechanisms. Have them take it from start to finish and encourage them heavily (reward system if you need to)",

You need to engage them in real life, make it fun. You really have to have a passion to do this, and you’re not going to get the passion for CAD if you aren’t actively doing a project in person with someone who can help you and make it slightly easier. There’s a big hump that people have to get over to WANT TO learn CAD and video tutorials/frcdesign .org will likely not be able to get you over that particular hump. Usually I’d recommend those tools once someone has really gotten themselves in the water of CAD a tiny little bit first. Make it fun, make it worth it, make it rewarding.",

One example is a CADathon. Another is pick an old game, design some mechanism, and then look at the best robots from that year and see if your thinking was similar.\n\nOur local football team is “not outstanding”, so I’m afraid I don’t have any advice there.",

Our certification consisted of logging a certain number of hours in frcdesign and/or some other project, and then taking a test where they had to CAD a swerve drivetrain with a bellypan, electronics, etc… During the offseason, we had our new members work on CADing last year’s kitbot from scratch, and use frcdesign to learn how to do stuff. We had experienced members(myself and our design lead) in the room working on other stuff ready to help them out and answer questions. By the beginning of build season, we had four new design students with lots of experience CADing between CADing the kitbot, doing exercises in frcdesign, and making a drivetrain for the certification test.",

Does learning CAD feel unapproachable? Is it a lack of guidance or teaching? Is it genuinely a lack of interest?\n\nThese all have different solutions. You might have all or none of those problems.\n\nFor overwhelming pressure:\n\nDescope the robot design to something appropriate for your design team and their skills\n\nProvide additional mentor assistance if available\n\nLack of progress:\n\nUnderstand where in their learning they hit this point-- is it that they aren’t making anything tangible? Is it that they’ve designed the same drivetrain a dozen times? Sometimes variety is needed, sometimes actually making something is needed. Depends a lot\n\nCAD feels unapproachable:\n\nBuild up to more complex CAD work-- you can’t just expect a kid to draw the rest of the owl. It’s easy to forget all the microsteps that go into even the simplest CAD work-- how to dimension a rectangle, how to draw and constrain holes apprpriately, etc. Start small, grow bigger.\n\nThis can also be the “boys club” issue John mentioned above. Creating space where it is psychologically safe to develop this skill is important in resolving this. The exact approach varies on the specific students and the exact situation on your team.\n\nLack of guidance/teaching:\n\nThis can vary-- CAD is fundamentally creative. Pointing them to specific exercises or resources can help, but you still need to check in and review on them. Most students work well when given personal attention-- check in, talk a little about the process and what they’re struggling with. Make sure you are available to help them bust through road blocks-- sometimes 5 seconds with an experienced designer can unblock something a novice has been struggling with for an hour.\n\nGenuine lack of interest:\n\nMost kids like pretty/cool parts and robots. Drawing the line from “this is something cool” to “this requires CAD” to “I can do this” is what you’re trying to do in their mind. You don’t need everyone to bite, just enough.\n\nPut CAD in the path to some other related goal. Yeah, you could just cut the tubes and build the swerve, but you need to make the CAD first. Ultimately if a student is motivated by something other than CAD for its own sake (which describes most) what CAD is is a tool that can be used to achieve an aim\n\nThat’s probably the reverse order of what you’re worried about, but I hope you find that useful. I’ve been teaching CAD and design for most of the last decade, and it is still a process I work to refine, since I am lucky enough to be able to worry about developing specific students. Different kids need different things at different times to be successful.",

You may not have a consistent path for each student to get your team rolling here.\n\nI can’t exactly provide a “cad mentor” pov, but as a mentor, and as someone who often tries to skirt CAD in my own projects, I think I can spot the issue, which is some feelings I share myself. In some cases, one might just prefer hands on prototype and iteration over buckling down over a computer. CAD is also a steep learning curve, which can really up the “busywork” factor when you could  just go off and “build the robot” instead. In some cases, CAD might not seem like it’s beneficial to the bigger picture at all.\n\nWhat I’ve found helps myself in these situations is being keenly aware of what the benefits of actually doing the CAD is . Things like access to 3D printed parts to streamline the build, being able to mock up a prototype in a sketch, or clearly communicate/validate a complex design all justify the legitimate amount of effort that goes into the magic rectangle.\n\nFrom an organizational perspective, cost . Our CAD guys have to have a “functional proof of concept” before we’ll buy parts for their cool ideas. This moves it from “optional” to “a necessary step to get to play with the robot”.\n\nIn the same vein, our team also has had great luck moving away from a “CAD Team” to a “functions team that designs, cads, and builds superstructure”. This builds on the general desire students have to actually build things, while also ensuring designers get the valuable feedback on manufacturability and reliability.\n\nThat said, if your team’s overall CAD skillset is low, set restrained requirements and only do the cad that needs to be done. Consider sticking with simpler tools like  KrayonCad, basic  Inventor sketches, rough assemblies, and once you’ve hit the minimum metric, let the students have fun.",

I was talking with your mentors about these, and honestly they looked like really solid ways to cover the basics, and ensure every student is prepped for the real competition season. Just all around fantastic training plans and goal setting, and totally fitting to shill in this thread.\n\nI didn’t spot the CAD plans, but I definitely was planning to steal a few ideas on the programming side.",

Basically, the mentors design a game for us to make a robot for, just like for build season, except naturally the game is less complicated than your typical FRC game and we get less time. Our team gets divided into 4 teams with each sub team represented in each, but since each of these smaller teams is small, each person learns a lot of the other skills. Including CAD. In fact, a marketing person did most of the CAD for my team and did it really well and learned a lot. With a little bit of tweaking, might be a good way to recruit some people into CAD?",
