Each link will take you to a Google Drive file or Github project. CAD files will be in .SLDPRT format, so let me know if you want .STEP files or something else to view.\n\nEvery offseason, we assign offseason projects to complete throughout the course of the fall semester to train and create resources for the season. These projects are completely student-led (except for the CAN Distribution Board) and our main focus this year was to teach students about designing and programming for the season. We also focus on training our rookie team, 2689 Team Alpha.\n\nDesign/Electrical Projects:\n\nCAN Distribution Board v2 An updated version of the CAN Distribution Board that includes 5 CAN connections and 3 power connections. Potential use cases would be for a swerve module or gearbox. GitHub - 2468shrm/CAN-Distribution-Board-With-Power-v2: A board to aid with CAN distribution in FRC applications.\n\nAn updated version of the CAN Distribution Board that includes 5 CAN connections and 3 power connections.

Able to be rigged as a normal cascade. One thing we found while assembling was that the tubes to construct the frame of the cascade have to be very square. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u7ZLcpTCmpj5XGW2Q3eDvcrBEnfew3qQ/view?usp=share_link\n\nA short cascade with the intent of testing Delrin brackets as a cheaper alternative to bearings.

Arms are made from polycarbonate. The durometer of the compliant wheels on the ends can be changed according to testing. The side arms are restrained by a bungee (not in CAD) from a standoff on the arm to the center standoff of the main bar. https://drive.google.com/file/d/16L1ioIKBT_cCm6NkE-mTiy9KY0LL99Gn/view?usp=sharing\n\nSubsystem to pick up power cubes from the 2018 Power Up game.

The first link is controlled by a capstan drive, and the second link, which would bear most of the robot’s weight, is driven by a winch. Unreeling the string attached to the second link moves the arm up due to a gas shock that is situated between the two links. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RU4gp_gmb2Fkj0NYK3priy677n-A6oD0/view?usp=sharing\n\nThis climb mechanism is designed for the 2022 FRC challenge, utilizing two links to traverse across the bars.

With three top rollers speed matched to the main flywheel, the design intent was to eliminate spin and provide consistency in shot placement. Furthermore, the dead axle belted hood system was designed to reduce play in hood position as much as possible. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CD-HMaFDkKv0WF84cVdV6BzGcNDv-bEE/view?usp=sharing\n\nThis shooter is designed for the 2022 cargo, and has an adjustable hood design.

It uses the SDS MK4 modules in combination with the new REV ION structure to create a drivebase. A traditional bellypan was not included to save weight and manufacturing time, and the side holes on the ION stock allow for easy mounting of electronic components. https://drive.google.com/file/d/148HgWA25iuV0OqCV0pBfBZ2wNm-dwjye/view?usp=sharing\n\nThis drivebase was our testbed for refining swerve code.

Follow their code on GitHub.\n\nSwerve Repository/Template Project: We have made some updates to our original swerve implementation to make it more efficient. This includes rewriting a lot of our VIs to use type definitions and better conventions to make it consistent across our project. We have also added some code for calculating our swerve odometry, and improved on our swerve pod control by eliminating sources of latency. We are currently adding support for a REV implementation: our latest progress can be seen in the REVTemplate branches. We are also improving our path following capabilities: our latest progress can be seen in the Auto branches.\n\nWe have made some updates to our original swerve implementation to make it more efficient.

Due to our increased interest this year in localizing our robot, we decided that we wanted to try and write our own. Currently, the implementation is complete, but there are still some minor fixes to be made. This includes better conventions and a better way to integrate various plants, sensors, and uncertainty models. There is an example VI that simulates the Kalman filter in the test folder in our repository.\n\nThis project was an initial attempt to get a Kalman filter up and running.

Due to the introduction of apriltags this year, we thought it would be cool to write a ROS package for a raspberry pi that could run our vision software for us. So far, we have written some nodes for decomposing the homography matrix from a detected apriltag and visualizing it in matplotlib.\n\nThis year, we tried getting our hands dirty in the realm of coprocessors.

Last year, we had numerous issues with noisy sensors and imperfect PID tunes. We eventually did find solutions through better rate measurements and implementing i-zones, however we wanted to find a simpler solution. As a result, we went back to basics, looking at bang bang, feedforward, and eventually an interesting take back half implementation from chief delphi. The results are shared in this project.\n\nThis project was an attempt to look at better methods for flywheel control. Last year, we had numerous issues with noisy sensors and imperfect PID tunes.

If you have any comments or feedback, we are always looking to improve, so please post those as well.\n\nEDIT: Added more radio mounts",

However, submodules don’t update when you clone without some additional settings. We’ve always worked around this by running a command to update the submodules afterwards, and I forgot about that when uploading everything publicly. Anyways, to fix your problem, you can run the command below.\n\nThe other thing with submodules is that switching branches in the higher level repository does not switch branches in the submodules. This means that you need to go into each submodule and update their branch to be compatible with the higher level repository. Since we mirror different branches in our swerve library and swerve template, you will need to change both in order to load the code properly. In our case, these branches are main, Auto, REVTemplate. The swerve submodule folder should be visible in the project root, so just change directories and run a checkout command.\n\nLet me know if this helps. All this info has been added into a README (probably should have done that originally) so that the code is easier to use.",
