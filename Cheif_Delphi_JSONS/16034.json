                    "cooked": "As of recently out team has been having a rough time programming and even connecting to our robot. This comes from a number of problems, including:\n\nIn FRC Driver Station, after successfully connecting to the robot and running the code in VSCode, the status light for robot code continuously blinks between green and red. The fact that it switches to red stops us from enabling the robot. This problem only occurred briefly before disappearing, although I’m afraid it’ll come back.\n\nWithin VSCode, after opening our code, all of the imports will show up as errors. The only fixes we know to this are running a command (./gradlew build) in the terminal or deleting and re-downloading the libraries, though these fixes are inconsistent and don’t always work. The problem itself is also extremely inconsistent, practically coming and going as it pleases.\n\nAfter successfully connecting to the robot’s radio, the robot connection status light in Driver Station remains red and Driver Station fails to recognize our robot’s connection. The only fix we know besides restarting and hoping is to comb through network adapter settings (which we tried changing wifi and ethernet IP settings) and firewall settings (which might be blocking the connection between Driver Station and the robot) to check if anything could be interfering with connection (this is sometimes the problem), and again, this is extremely inconsistent and doesn’t always work.\n\nIf you know any solutions to these problems, please let me know, it would help greatly.",
