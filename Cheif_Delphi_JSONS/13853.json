                    "cooked": "Your conclusions are right, but the reasoning is slightly off. The integrated motors do have an absolute reading that they can be set to boot to. However, the steering motor on the MK4 goes through a 12.8:1 reduction. That means for a given orientation of the motor shaft, there are 12-13 corresponding orientations of the module. This is why you can’t use the integrated encoder alone to be sure of your position on boot-up even though it’s absolute.\n\nThe CANcoder magnet is mounted so that it’s 1:1 with the module (in fact, starting with the MK3 it turns directly with the module, no gear proxy or anything), so every value of the CANcoder has precisely one possible orientation of the module.\n\nThe template code 2910 provides actually only uses the CANcoders on boot-up to seed the integrated encoder value, then uses a position closed loop on the motor controller with the integrated motor encoder. I presume this is for latency reasons, but I have heard of teams successfully using the CANcoders for their feedback loops.\n\nEdit: Sorry @chadr03 , seems I did that thing where I confidently corrected someone who was already correct - at least on the NEO side. NEOs only have relative encoders available through the API. Internally it’s technically an absolute encoder, but one that goes through its full range every 1/7th of a rotation which isn’t very useful to the end user; therefore, it’s not exposed through the API. However, the Falcon 500 encoder is absolute for the entire shaft rotation and is exposed to the API.",

As others have mentioned, this introduces extra latency in the steering feedback loop, but theoretically is more accurate because the control loop is closed on actual module position and is not effected by any backlash in the gearing. This was what we tried first and it worked and we did not do an in-depth comparison between robot path tracking performance in this mode versus seed-on-boot as is done in the example code.\n\nBoth methods clearly work, but it would be interesting to look at the error introduced by closing the loop on Falcon500 angle. Would be pretty easy to do by just plotting the estimated module angle from the Falcon500 encoder vs. reading the value directly off the CANCoder. Maybe I will suggest this as a project to our team, though would be curious to know if anyone already did this.",

For some teams, CANcoders will make it harder to reign in an overloaded bus, while others will have no trouble ramping them up to a 5ms status frame period.\n\nTL;DR CAN is a trade-off, not a straight negative.

From there, you (generally) would use one of the CTRE conversion boards to convert that to a 3 pin wire, which would then plug in to your Rio. By no means impossible to do, but it does require some funky connections, and some skill to make those wires reliably.\n\nThe CANCoder is generally regarded to be simpler to wire.  You can either solder your own pigtails, or have the pigtails soldered on for you from CTRE. Then you just wire it in to your CANbus, and you are good to go. This simplified the wiring for us at least.\n\nI’m curious about the ttb encoders because it simplifies that wiring. You can plug them straight into the analog port on the Rio. I also think it may be possible to plug them in to the Spark MAX. (this assumes they do work at 3.3V, and/or you use the REV breakout board )",
