We have access to a CNC router, and were thinking of using materials along the lines of Delrin and HDPE, but we were wondering if any teams have experience with a similar application, and which materials and thicknesses they used for this, and if this is a viable strategy in general.",

                    "cooked": "CAN you do it, probably. But, I would expect a few issues–be prepared to waste some material.\n\nWeight–check the strength-weight ratio of plastics vs metals, especially for HDPE/Delrin/UHMW. Some of these can be pretty dense, and not as strong per se as aluminum or steel. You can probably get some more strength by using thicker material, but that comes at a weight penalty. You might not save much weight overall.\n\nStrength–this one depends a lot on the loading. Turret? Probably not going to have a lot of loading if the turret is a) light and b) NOT sticking any part outside the robot. (If any part goes outside the robot, the question is “which tooth breaks first” rather than “do we break teeth”.) Shooter hood? Probably OK, unless we’re shooting bowling balls. Intake? Make like 20 gears, replace every match. Not necessarily from the intake load itself, but from getting beat up all match. –Note for strength: Do yourself a favor and do a gear tooth stress analysis.\n\nAccurate tooth profiles–just going to say to make darn sure you can actually cut the teeth accurately. This might mean a finer cutter than you’d normally use.\n\nI’m going to be kinda blunt here: I’ve seen cast-iron gear teeth fail a couple stages of reduction (one of which was chain) back from the part of the arm that hit something hard. I’m not sure I’d trust any gear that isn’t metal in FRC, and I’m a little bit skeptical of the aluminum gears.\n\nThat said, if you were to make a sprocket or pulley instead, particularly for the turret base, you’d be on much safer ground. Those spread the load over multiple teeth, so you can use thinner material and save more weight.\n\nDon’t get me wrong: It’s an interesting design exercise, and now would be a decent time to take a look at it. I just don’t think it’s going to work as well as one would hope.",

                    "cooked": "We’ve used plastic gears many times over the years. Here’s 3 different manufacturing methods and their uses:\n\nLaser Cutting In 2016 our hood extended with a servo driving a 1/4\" delrin 20DP sector gear that was lasercut delrin. This is probably the weakest version (20DP and delrin), but because of the servo driving it, it didn’t move crazy fast and so loads were low and it was ok. image 1893×1493 93.7 KB\n\nimage 1893×1493 93.7 KB\n\nimage 1893×1493 93.7 KB\n\n3D Printing We very often 3D printed (Markforged Onyx) gears and especially pulleys. Pulleys work better when printed/plastic because many teeth of the pulley are meshing with the belt and transmitting the loads, versus just 1 tooth of the a gear.\n\nOur 2020 and 2022 shooter hoods were 20DP 3D printed curved sector gears and worked great for getting a ton of reduction for a controllable hood with minimal parts. The 2020 hood even had a printed pinion gear. The 3D printed parts also served to fill the gap between the turret and the rollers on the hood when hood was extended.\n\nRouter We cut a 10DP rack gear out of 1/4\" polycarbonate for our 2023 floor cube intake. This enabled the intake to deploy with the rack+pinion and also be flexible polycarb to survive impacts. To be able to actually cut on a router with our smallest 3mm diameter endmill we had to modify the tooth profile, adding additional undercut to the teeth so the endmill would get all the way in. image 1920×654 148 KB\n\nimage 1920×654 148 KB\n\nimage 1920×654 148 KB",

When they fail you would see that the broken tooth gets “topped” and think “Man, if only that tooth was made from something stronger”.  True, a stronger tooth would have helped but the main culprit was the teeth separating from bushing/bearing movement, shaft flex, and case spread.\n\nGears want to separate with extreme prejudice when under load.  Put extra thought in how the gears are held together.  In our case, we made the teeth as big as possible, as wide as possible, and revised the bushing and its support and it solved the problem.",

I believe 5406 has cut gears from delrin or UHMW at various times over the years for their robots.\n\nOne thing to consider when doing this, is what size gear is appropriate for your application. I’m not talking about tooth count necessarily, but rather something like a 10dp gear vs a 20dp gear.\n\nDepending on the machines you have access to, cutting the standard FRC tooth profile (20dp, 14.5° pressure angle) is going to be challenging at best, impossible at worst.\n\nGoing to a larger tooth profile will make the part easier to machine, and also may better resist shearing a tooth off your gear.",

We were using the REV through bore encoder and connecting to max spline so we used a couple 3DP gears and a 3DP mount to connect it. Note that this was printed on a MarkForged, but I’d expect it could work with other materials. image 511×610 55.2 KB\n\nimage 511×610 55.2 KB\n\nimage 511×610 55.2 KB",

It worked great, we drove it with an aluminum pinion made from an drivetrain gear that had lost all its teeth, the turret was used for 1 district through dcmp, cmp, and 4 off seasons with no wear or breakage problems. You will need to use very large teeth both for strength and to accommodate minimum internal radii. I believe we used 10DP (don’t quote me on that) and we still had to use a 1/16” router bit to avoid major changes to the root geometry.",

We have used them for turrets and hoods (inspired by some of the 254 designs above!). I would probably not recommend it for an intake though.\n\nWe also print 3D timing belt pulleys. One trick is to not 3D print a hex hub. Instead make the hub fit a small metal gear as this is much stronger. We have done this to mount a printed timing belt pulley directly to a motor with a pinion gear for a shooter.\n\nFor extra strength I have heard of people injecting epoxy into a 3D print. Apparently Team 4774 has done this.",
