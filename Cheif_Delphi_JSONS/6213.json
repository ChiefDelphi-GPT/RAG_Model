I understand how the electrical systems work I just would like some resources and the previous person who did this used wagos for our neos but the connectors weren’t rated for that size of stranded wire but solid wire. Also, any examples of redundancy in your electrical systems that you would suggest.",

                    "cooked": "Generally you’ll find that PP45 crimp connectors are the most common for actuator power connections, as they are very durable, can be customized in blocks, and quality crimpers are quite affordable. The other benefit is that they can be locking, if you add either the custom retaining clip, or a 4\" zip tie through each blocked connector’s hole. We source ours from PowerWerx most often.\n\nFor 22-24awg signal level connections ( CAN bus, USB, PWM ), the Molex SL line has become increasingly popular recently, aided by the advent of Molex being a program supplier in 2024, and kits with the OEM crimp tool being in the second round of FIRST Choice. It has an active lock, and to separate housings, a tab needs to be pushed down. We used them this season, and had zero faults on correctly crimped connectors (which is very easy to do with the offical crimp tool)\n\nI’m wondering about your previous experience with the wago connectors. Which model are they? AFAIK the 221-2401 has no problem with the 12awg silicone wires which come on REV products, though it can sometimes be a bit of a squeeze.\n\nAs far as redundancy goes, I wouldn’t say there are many examples of needing that with the current control system setup. with the previous radio, I might’ve advised you to use both the PoE port + DC barrel jack, but the VH-109 fixes that issue. Its best advised to only use one power source from what I understand. Some steps you can take to improve your wiring however - -Plan ahead for electronics placement, wire routing, and cable channels/chains/grommets. I typically just take an overhead screenshot of our drivetrain CAD, and sketch into paint 90% of the wires. -Purchase corrugated split loom or Techflex Flexo f6 cable wrap to protect wiring from any potential continuous abrasion from mechanisms. -MAKE SURE TO ADD AMPLE STRAIN RELIEFS!!! -use hot melt glue (or an alternative removable quick set adhesive) to secure any non-locking or loose connections (USB, SMAX CAN cables, RIO I/O). Tip- 70% isopropyl alcohol is a good solvent to use if hot glue is being stubborn to remove. -If heat shrink is needed, always use clear",

                    "cooked": "Getting the strands of the silicone wire into a inline wago is a bit of a pain but perfectly possible. The advantage of wagos is they can be used with essentially not tools and reused so you can wire up a bot very easily without measuring and terminating wires off bot. Wagos are best if you buy wire with a lower strand count than the silicone stuff that is so popular these days, (65 strand vs 680 strands)\n\nIf you have good soldering irons and are willing to put in the extra time and effort solder and quality check every joint, XT90s are extremely robust. You really need to carefully train everyone who is going to solder the joints, and have every joint checked by a second person before it goes on bot.\n\nIt’s also very important to reduce the number of connections as much as possible.\n\nFor CAN you can’t really discuss connectors without talking about configuration. There are people here more qualified than me to talk about this, but star configuration is almost always a bad idea, a single trunk with branches to each device is good as long as the branches are short, and daisy chaining between devices is the best right up until a connector comes out of a motor controller and you loose half the network. We use wago 222-413s and 415s to build a trunk with branches no longer than 6\" to each device. This means that if any device comes unplugged or its connector fails, nothing else is affected, reducing the impact of damage on the robot and making it very obvious where the problem is. If you are going to daisy chain you devices, do not jam extra wires into a connector that isn’t designed for them to jumper a device in case it gets unplugged. This has been a problem with the JSTs used on REV devices , the crimp won’t grip properly, the housing can crack and the whole thing becomes less reliable. Instead you can solder or crimp a jumper just outside the connector. Whatever else you do with CAN add strain relief, zip tie the wires so they can’t be pulled on, and hot glue the connectors.",
