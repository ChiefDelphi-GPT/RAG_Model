Then vscode couldn’t find RoboRio. Because USB failed, then we decided to try using Wifi with a radio. BTW, if it adds any value, we also tried using WinSCP to check the SD card boot image but WinSCP said SFTP port is not open, but FTP is. We then tried FTP, it said “Connection refused”. I am assuming vscode is probably pushing code to the robot by similar way. So, there must be something wrong with the configuration of the image. Double checking with the instructions on “how to image RoboRio2” doesn’t show anything about configuring the image. It seems we are doing everything the instructions said: remove SD card from Rio, insert into laptop, extract the image from the Imaging tool zip file via the SD button, using BalenaEtcher to flash the image, set the team number, plug the SD card back in the Rio and power it up. That’s all we did.",

If I did, it “allowed” it and probably did not do all the necessary “settings”. Since I am not sure what I did, I decided to re-image the SD card carefully this time. After re-inserting the SD card back in the Rio, web browser can access the Rio via 172.22.11.2 and Driver Station said there was communication. Interestingly, the imaging tool could not find the Rio (via “Rescan”). I decided to connect to the Rio via WiFi and the imaging tool found the Rio this time. So, I have successfully set the team number and noticed it also uploaded JRE to the Rio. vscode now successfully deployed code to the Rio. Thank you.",
