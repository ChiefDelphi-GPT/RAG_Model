                    "cooked": "For the 2023 season, I’ve released new version 3.0.1 of the (unofficial) FRC Plugin for IntelliJ IDEA . Versions 2022.1.x,  2022.2.x and 2022.3.x of IntelliJ IDEA are supported for all editions (Community, Education, and Ultimate). As of last year, I am increasing the major version number each build season for better clarity of when the plugin supports the next build season. Hence the 3.0 version.\n\nYou can install by going to File | Settings | Plugins , select the “Marketplace” tab, and then search for “FRC”. Select the “FRC” plugin and click the Install button. After it completes, you may need to restart IntelliJ IDEA.\n\nTo upgrade , go the File | Settings | Plugins , select the “Installed” tab, then search either for “FRC” or for “/outdated”. Click the “Update” button. After it completes, you may need to restart IntelliJ IDEA.\n\nI’ve updated of the New FRC Project Wizard to support the 2023 templates. The Java templates are direct ports of the official WPI Lib templates, with the ability to add some enhancements such as Kotlin support, include a customized the .gitignore file (or exclude it), and more. The Kotlin templates are my conversions of the official Java templates,  and are modified to be more Kotlinesque. The Kotlin files are created in src/main/java rather than src/main/kotlin so you can very easily use both Java and Kotlin code in the project, with the classes living side by side.\n\nWhen you use the the FRC Project Wizard within IntelliJ IDEA, it creates a series of IntelliJ IDEA Run/Debug Configurations for running the various gradle tasks to build and/or deploy the robot, and for attaching the debugger . In the past, this was the only time or way to create the run/debug configurations. As requested in this comment by @warren.parsons IntelliJ IDEA will now create the run debug configurations when adding the FRC Facet.  The FRC Facet should automatically be added when opening a robot project for the first time in IntelliJ IDEA, such as one created externally. (You can also manually add the FRC Facet to the Gradle main module as described in the IntelliJ IDEA documentation.) Finally, you can add the run/debug configurations via an action from the menu: Tools | FRC | Create Run/Debug Configurations | Create Build, Deploy, and Debugging Run/Debug Configurations . Note that the configurations are saved in a .run directory in the root of the project. This directory can be stored in Git (or your version control of choice) for team sharing. Its presence will not affect VS Code users.\n\nWhile the Gradle “riolog” task can be used to view the riolog output in the Gradle build window, the FRC Plugin provides a dedicated RioLog Console Tool Window which allows for pausing, restarting, search, and clearing of the output, either on demand or automatically upon robot restart. It also provides native supports the awesome Grep Console plugin providing you with color syntax highlighting, output folding – so you can have those verbose debug statements folded out of view until you need them – as well as the ability to filter out lines. (FYI, I have no affiliation with the free Grep Console plugin. I just think its a great plugin and therefore wanted to provide support for it, if for no other reason then for my own use )\n\nimage 1079×260 28.5 KB\n\nimage 1079×260 28.5 KB\n\nimage 1079×260 28.5 KB\n\nThere are several command based robot class templates to make coding easier. For example, when creating a command, you can select required subsystems:\n\nThe resultant created command will have the appropriate call to addRequirements :\n\nimage 820×208 32.5 KB\n\nimage 820×208 32.5 KB\n\nimage 820×208 32.5 KB\n\nIn Commands written in Kotlin as well:\n\nimage 848×218 24.3 KB\n\nimage 848×218 24.3 KB\n\nimage 848×218 24.3 KB\n\nProjects created via the new project wizard have run debug configurations generated for them. This not only makes building and deploying easier – and accessible from all the familiar run/debug keyboard shortcuts – but it makes debugging easier. No more digging through the docs or Chief Delphi to refresh your memory on how to configure things to attach your Robot to the debugger. Simply run the “Build & Deploy Robot for Debugging” configuration, then use one of the “Debug Robot” debugger tasks (depending on how you are connected to the robot) to attach IntelliJ IDEA’s debugger.\n\nYou can also access the gradle based run/debug configurations from the Gradle tool window:\n\nYou can, as of 2023, also create these run/debug configurations via the menu: Tools | FRC | Create Run/Debug Configurations | Create Build, Deploy, and Debugging Run/Debug Configurations .\n\nTheses run/debug configurations are stored in a .run directory in the root of the project to allow sharing via git. It you do share via git, when updating the project in another instance of IntelliJ IDEA, they may not get recognized and added to the UI immediately. Closing the project and reopening will result in their discovery. (This is a core IntelliJ IDEA feature and the delay of them being recognized is out of my hands.)\n\nWhen a WPILib update is available, the FRC Plugin will provide a notification to you. And with one click, your gradle build file will be updated to the new version, and your project re-imported (i.e. sync’ed).\n\nThe check for update can also be run manually from the Tool menu:\n\nAs always, I sincerely appreciate any feedback you have. Please let me know if you are finding the plugin worthwhile by commenting below, or giving it a quick 5 star rating , or leaving a review. Also please feel free to open any feature requests, or report any issue via the Project’s Issue Tracker . I have a few more minor tweaks I hope to get done and pushed out soon before my Software Mentoring duties become my main focus for Q1.\n\nGood luck to all the teams this year. I hope this plugin helps you to develop your robot with pleasure.",

It has really good exception handling that will catch almost all issues. If it does crash, it is usually a sign of a corrupt file. Either in the project or the IntelliJ IDEA installation. So I’d try it on a fresh project (i.e. re-clone it from git, or create a new one) and/or reinstalling IntelliJ IDEA. You can also take a look at the logs ( Help > Show Log in Explorer ) and see if it reveals anything. Finally, while I can’t see a corrupt index crashing IntelliJ IDEA, I suppose anything is possible. So try invalidating the caches ( File > Invalidate Caches… ).",

I just published an update this past Monday that fixed a few minor things, including a potential corner case issue in the Gradle build file for a Kotlin Robot. But I’m not aware of anything specific to a problem with the Kotlin Command template. If you can let me know the specifics here, or open a bug report , I’d be happy to get it fixed ASAP. I love Kotlin and want to see more teams using it. So anything I can do to help with that is a priority for me. Thanks.",

But I typically do not have the time to also deploy to a roboRIO and try running them to catch runtime issues like this. In the future I’ll try to at least run a project for the primary templates. (And ironically, I have a custom Kotlin Command Based Robot template that I use for our team, so I did not notice this.) Thanks again for letting me know.",
