Every robot is different and control system different.\n\nIf your using the Neural Detection features to find things you trained as robots, I think you can get the center of the detected “box” as a 3d point in field space. It could be fairly assumed with a limelight (and encoders), you could have good data about your own Field space.\n\nIf possible, I would not “b line” it to the midpoint.  But instead find the intersection of two lines.  The first is perpendicular to the pythagorean line beteww the two bots at the midpoint.  And the other a parallel line to that pythagorean line that your robot is on.\n\nBut again there is not alot of real estate on that charging station.  If you got field-space, then you can reference the bounds of the charging station as an object in some way.  Maybe if the two bots are close to each other and there is space on one side, an algorithm can plot your path there.",
