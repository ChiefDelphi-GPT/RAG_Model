Our climber consists of two single stage ThriftyBot elevators, each with their own encoder, to reach up for the rung and a pair of rotating arms, each with their own encoder,  with a hook to latch onto the bar. If we get far enough, we will use a combination of rotating the arms and extending the elevators to get to the next rung. Here’s the question: we want to keep the robot level (left to right) while lifting the robot. This requires the two elevators to move at the same speed, especially under load, and end up at the same place. Are we better off using two independent PID loops or just have one PID on one side and make the other side’s Neo a follower?",

If so, you’ll want independent control of both sides. This also leads to:\n\njfitz0807:\n\nThis requires the two elevators to move at the same speed,\n\nIf there’s extra load on one side (say, a little more friction, or rubbing on your neighbor robot), your speed will be a little off. Closed loop control won’t make that perfect. The error in the speed will accumulate over time, leading to a position error.\n\nAt a minimum, I would control to a desired position which ramps smoothly between the extended and retracted heights.\n\nSaid another way: You generally care less about the velocity of one side at any given time than you do its position.\n\nAdding on to this:\n\njfitz0807:\n\nwe want to keep the robot level\n\nA general rule of thumb in control theory - if at all possible, measure what you want to control. If this is what you technically care about, you actually don’t really care about the arm position directly. You might want to measure how far the robot is tilted, and use that to offset the arm position to keep the whole thing level. This could help correct if the bar isn’t even, or one claw grabs slightly askew, or if the climber isn’t mounted perfectly.\n\nIf the probability of these is low, you could assume the clamping position and infer robot levelness from arm position.\n\nAll that being said… this is very much a case of “fixing hardware with software”. Software will never be able to keep things perfectly in sync, or re-distribute shock loads when an alliance member bumps you. I definitely won’t say your configuration is flawed and won’t work, but also be careful not to expect too much out of the system.",

That way, each would be at least aiming at the same spot at any given time.\n\nI don’t think anyone here was proposing using PID to control the speed of the climbers, instead controlling the position . Using two loops for this is certainly one way to go.\n\nThe challenge is mostly that you have to do more work to not only control the end position, but to also ensure that the intermediate positions of the climber are in relative sync with one another. A number of different ways to do this, that people smarter than me will elaborate on, but it’s not really about targeting a specific speed of movement directly (though capping velocity could be potentially useful)",

One side of the robot was heavier, so it would lift slower than the other side. We solved this by using a Motion Magic motion profile on the heavy side and a PID on the light side that had a setpoint of the heavy side’s current position. You can see it in action here (we are the center blue bot). This is a less elegant way of doing what Peter_Johnson suggested above, but it worked.",
