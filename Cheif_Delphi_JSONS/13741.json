In theory, an elevator should be a readily reusable mechanism across years, with only a few overall dimension changes and gear ratio adjustments needed to make a 2022 climber into a 2018 cube placer. A variety of factors in the design have meant that each elevator has many small but time-consuming changes to work past the interferences introduced by each new use case. Each part of the elevator was competing for the same space, gussets, rigging, backstrap mounting, etc. With this in mind, the goal of this project was to separate and compact every subsystem in the elevator as much as reasonably possible.\n\nFeatures:\n\n-Capstan driven, continuous rigged, two-stage elevator -In tube rigging, -bearing blocks function also as rigging pulley mounts -tube connector block construction -gearboxes serve a dual purpose as triangular support for the base stage -ratchet and bungee tensioning system -clip-on spacers between bearings for easy assembly",

It’s really easy for the rope to run off the reel, or get slack and tangle.  I would consider using chain - you could get rid of the whole tensioning system altogether.\n\nfor the similar reason, cascade rigging is much easier to get working well than continuous.  You don’t have to rely on gravity to keep the middle stage at a given spot.  Running the rope inside the tube is particularly challenging (but good on you if you pull it off)\n\nAre those custom bearing blocks?  Because if so (and if you haven’t made them before) I’d recommend buying them instead.  There’s so many good COTS options now - there’s zero reason to reinvent the wheel.",

I love the attention to detail on everything.\n\nSome thoughts:\n\nI strongly recommend using the MKCAD design library for any FRC projects in Onshape, as it’ll make the process of getting not-broken hardware into your assembly way easier.\n\nThe ultra-low-profile screws on your bearing blocks are just begging to be rounded out at a critical time. I would recommend only going as low as normal low-profile screws, and if you have to cut a bearing to avoid interference, so be it.\n\nYour bearing blocks are currently a PITA to fabricate, but luckily with a few small changes they can be improved. (1): Split the nub on the end into a separate, COTS spacer part, such as McM 92510A460 . (2): Save yourself a facing operation by making the thickness of the bearing block a “normal” value, such as .375\" or .500\", letting you make the blocks from bar stock. (3): Remove the groove and nub on the inside face, using a COTS spacer to separate out the bearing and just adding an extra screw to retain the block.\n\nYour spools shouldn’t be “combs” - that won’t help control the rope winding. Instead, the grooves in your spools should either be nonexistent (if you’re OK with introducing a spring to take up any mismatch in lengths) or helical.\n\nI like the current way the gearbox is set up. You can save on some hardware and complexity by making your pulley-mounting-screws go through the gearbox as well to mount it. This also means you can cut out some locknuts. If you don’t do this, make sure that you have clearance to get a wrench around those tightly-spaced locknuts.\n\nIt looks like all your spacers are custom parts. You can cut down on complexity by using COTS spacers - this may require you to move to inch-standard bearings, but in my opinion it’s much wiser to use inch-bearings in FRC anyway.\n\nPay some attention to designing for assembly. A number of parts in the elevator are very hard to access by hand, and some screw heads are completely unreachable when the elevator is fully assembled. Every layer of disassembly adds anywhere from one to ten minutes of disassembly time to get at key parts of your robot, so making all the hardware accessible is critical to reducing your robot’s downtime in the pits.\n\nI recommend buying a handful of pulley-bearings and testing them all out in person before committing to the pulleys you use. I personally really like these for the task of carrying 1/8\" rope, because you can carry them with a # 10 screw.",

                    "cooked": "Firstly, thank you for your time and input.\n\nA little more background on previous designs we’ve tried: this year we ran a capstan system of almost exactly the same drum design. IMG_20220228_220258943|666x500 IMG_20220220_194601718 3456×4608 2.7 MB\n\nIMG_20220220_194601718 3456×4608 2.7 MB\n\nIMG_20220220_194601718 3456×4608 2.7 MB\n\nAt the beginning of the season we had a lot of trouble keeping tension in the line but with some help from 3310 we switched to a pre stretched dyneema they pointed us toward, and switched the extension springs we had for tensioning out for surgical tubing. Once we did those two things we never had another problem with it and never in the season did we experience the line tangle or skip out of the grooves.\n\nWe have built cascade elevators in the past using the chain method, but for an elevator that is meant to fill many roles, continous seems to fit the bill better as it  doesn’t suffer from the same force multiplication as you increase stages, you can run a cascade with string and two different diameter drums to solve that problem but then you’re more complex than continuous.\n\nRunning the line in the tube was not a decision made lightly, the main driving factor was the ability to couple it with the bearings already in place and delete a boatload of parts and space.\n\nYes those are custom bearing blocks along with everything else. There are a few reasons for this. First, none of the cots ones on the market quite fit exactly like I wanted and making them custom allows for a lot of small optimizations. Second, with our teams manufacturing ability making custom parts that are already designed vs ordering and waiting is just about a wash in terms of time, especially considering how fast some products sell out.",

The gearbox is mounted at two points only, so you can remove one bolt and pivot it up in order to get more room to string the capstan. without this feature, it would be near impossible to rig the elevator.\n\nThe bolts for the pulleys being separate from the gearbox was a deliberate choice.

This was inspired by 2881’s 2022 intake in which they used the same system to space their roller wheels at even intervals. Additionally, since they are all small parts printed without support, with very little requirement for precision it should be easy to crank out a whole bunch overnight. As far as inch bearings go I tried for many hours to source ones that would work, but I just could not find the combination of radial and V-groove bearing that would work at a reasonable price point. Additionally, most inch bearings are designed with fractional id’s which means you either have to sand your bolts (done that, not fun) or use shoulder bolts which gets expensive fast.\n\nBack to my opinions on spacers, the spacers are all custom 3d printed this choice was made so that they could be clipped on from the side with the bolt already in place.

The first reason I am okay with it the way it is is that all the hidden bolts are in the tube connectors which is the least likely place to need maintenance. It should be noted that every bolt will be blue loctited and allowed the full cure time. The second reason I’m okay with this is that I think the alternatives are worse. putting gussets on the outside creates endless interferences with the bearings and was one of the main reasons I decided to try something different.\n\nHidden bolts: This is one of my least favorite parts of this design, second only to small spacers on my list of maintenance nightmares are hard-to-reach bolts.

You might look at a die spring (compression) as a tensioner, with an eyebolt through the middle to couple the line to it.  We’ve used this on VERY large scale as a tension amplifier on a wireline winch.  They key bit is that you need to maintain tension on the “slack” side so the capstan has something to amplify.  At some point you get into trouble where the wireline can take more tension than it can survive on the spool; the wire gets crushed.  Sorry about the low-res image.

You don’t need a perfectly round thing touching the bearing, you just need to not touch the moving part.\n\nI’d also plan in some rubber bump stops, but that’s my paranoia talking\n\nA sneaky thing would be to 3DP some mating combs to keep your cable in the capstans when the tension is off to make assembly easier.",

Bonus points if you can squeeze in some corner braces on the frames Rubber feet for enclosures work for bumpers and normally have a hole and a washer mounded in them.  You could space them up and have a matching window in the frame so that it bumps the far side of the tube.  That minimizes the clearance you need to build in for the bumpers.  You do need to plan in some over travel to squeeze them…",

The holes in the tubes for the screws will have some clearance that will allow some shifting around. Any small shift is magnified by the length of the tubes. The lengths of the tubes also allow a lot of leverage to be applied to the screws when there is a force or impact on the structure. These forces can come from contact with other robots or field structures or they can come from the mass of the carriage, any mechanisms mounted on the carriage and any game pieces held by the mechanisms as the robot accelerates or decelerates, especially when the elevator is fully extended.\n\nimage 707×530 72 KB\n\nimage 707×530 72 KB\n\nimage 707×530 72 KB\n\nIf one is using gussets on the outer surfaces, they would tend to clamp the vertical and horizontal tubes together and possibly resist torquing of the structure better.",

While in general I like continuous rigging with rope due to its low weight and price, it has to be done correctly to get the benefits without introducing headaches with rigging\n\nHaving only .1in of separation between stages does not leave much clearance for rope. You can only run 1/16th uhmwpe rope which when climbing with two ropes has almost no safety factor between the load experienced when climbing and the maximum working load of the rope. I would suggest allowing the design to run 7/64ths to allow climbing without worries.\n\nHaving only .1in of separation between stages does not leave much clearance for rope.

Slight differences in their feeding can cause the system to bind up. While running a shaft to link the motors is infeasiable here, there is a second method of mechanically linking the motors. Instead of having two motors on each side, you can replace one of the gearboxes with point to tie the extension rope off and put both motors on the other side so they both spool a single rope than runs on both sides. However, this requires spooling up twice and much string and creates an additional 2:1 reduction that will also have to be mirrored on the retract string. This also halves the number of spools and tensioning points that need to be maintained while taking any tensioning mechanisms off the carriage of the elevator.\n\nThe motors on the elevator are not mechanically linked to each other.

Mechanically the setup worked great, the challenge was getting the gearing balanced enough to climb (power gearing) versus lifting the crate up to the platform (speed gearing). We error too much on power.  The two straps were powered by a single axle driven by a winch.  For robustness, both raise and lower cycles were powered.  We used harpoon tubing to allow the lowering strap to stretch, so the system wouldn’t bind or sag as the pulley diameter changes as the strapping winds on the pulley.",

This is going to make the Falcon encoder to elevator position function change over time.\n\nIn over constrained systems like this one, keeping the right and left sides mechanically synchronized in critical for function; racking will make the system stop working!  I’m not sure how you are planning on attaching the ropes…  You should think carefully about your rigging in order to force the right and left sides to move together.\n\nLoad sharing and position control with the two separate drives may become a challenge.  Something to think about.  A belt loop between the two sides is a solid way to force the two Falcons to stay in step.",
