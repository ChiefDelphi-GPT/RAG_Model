                    "cooked": "Hi everyone, I am a student in what I would consider an “intermediate” team, and am now the main programmer for the team.\n\nOur team has been writing our own swerve drive code just using the features WPILib provides, and it’s been working fine so far. We have learned a lot about programing swerve and this year and I really feel like we have stepped up our game in terms of making the most of swerve (getting PathPlanner working, smart use of IO layers that allows simulation with AdvantageKit, full field localization with PhontonVision). This year, I took heavy inspiration from the Spark Swerve example in AdvantageKit’s example project, but still didn’t copy so I really feel like I understand the code. We also have a good number of freshman who seem like pretty talented programmers, and other members who can definitely program and are excited to do so, so I’m not worried about going for the simplest solution.\n\nI am wondering if it would still be worth it to switch to YAGLS for better performance in Swerve. I assume there are many optimizations to make swerve even better, which I am not even aware of, and using a well maintained tool normally seems better than reinventing the wheel. It also has some cool features (physics sim from maple sim, swerve setpoint generator created by FRC team 254) that I have not tried, but I am mostly just wanting to get some nice driving code with some auto alignment for the first time. I would be sad to ditch the swerve code I have worked on this year but I would definitely do it for better swerve performance and quicker/more accurate driving in auto, whatever that might mean.\n\nI know this is kinda open ended but I have just been conflicted on this, so thanks in advance for any insights, and thanks for reading this slightly long and rambling post!\n\n(might be unrelated but we are using mk4i swerve modules with NEO V1.1s motors with spark max motor controllers and a CANCoder, and we just got a Pigion2 as our gyro)",

I guess the biggest thing for me is how easy is it to do april tags? We’ve got a command that we can use in both tele-op and auto that allows us to lineup at a tag, but Im not sure if that command would really transfer over to YAGSL , and how easy it would be to replicate something similar in it",

Don’t get me wrong, there is absolutely a time and place where I’d heavily recommend YAGSL to a team trying to figure out swerve. But, to me that time and place is not for a programming team who already has figured out PathPlanner, AdvantageKit IO Layers, and PhotonVision full field localization.\n\nOf course, you should still strive to make those improvements to your code. Maple-sim already has a template based around the AdvantageKit Spark Swerve example.\n\nYou could incorporate 254’s Swerve Setpoint Generator by looking at 6328’s code which also follows the AdvantageKit template (Side note - I couldn’t find setpoint generator in YAGSL ’s source code, might be mistaken though).\n\nMost of the optimizations done by YAGSL are also included in the AdvantageKit template, but you should still code trace their drive code here to see what they do (and how it compares).",

Driver control was similar, but where we noticed the biggest difference was in positioning.  We were able to consistently hit note and go to positions with YAGSL , even out to the center line.\n\nYou are in a weird position right now middle of build season.  I feel YAGSL was worth it, but do you want to take a couple weeks out of build season to learn and integrate it? If your swerve code was good enough, maybe it’s best to go with what you know.  The worst thing you can do is not be able to drive.\n\n(We struggled at our first event last season “drunk driving”, as we had a loose gyro all event.  It’s the worst kind of failure, the sensor is there, and responding with reasonable values in the pits, just the vibrations threw off everything.  We tore up our code from ‘23 trying to find something, and I don’t know if YAGSL would have helped there either.))",

These are features that are not present in any current FRC swerve code implementation because they are hard but would provide an improvement (not a massive one) which would help better use the limits of the battery and system dynamics, and eliminate rotation skew at the source. I’ve done this sort of things for mecanum and omni drives which does provide a noticeable performance boost over traditional code, but swerve is a whole lot harder because of module rotation.\n\nWithout accounting for this, the swerve libraries mostly do the same thing and have the same usual problems such as sometimes saturating the motors and having skew. At that point, no swerve code switch is going to be meaningful enough to offset swapping swerve code in the middle of season, which takes a while which would be better spend on autos or tele-op automation, as your driver will learn the quirks resulting from imperfect swerve code in the first few hours.",

Don’t get me wrong, there is absolutely a time and place where I’d heavily recommend YAGSL to a team trying to figure out swerve. But, to me that time and place is not for a programming team who already has figured out PathPlanner, AdvantageKit IO Layers, and PhotonVision full field localization.\n\nI agree with AMysterium here. If your team has a working base while the additional features can be great, timing is also a decision to be made. It’s the middle of build season and competition is looming, I’d say switching or doing a proof of concept to get it working would be a great offseason project.\n\nFrom my experience as an Engineer for work, there are additional items to consider that may not be as apparent right now. Using a library of any kind often means you are abstracting out logic and functionality, which means you no longer have control over how it behaves and calculates. This may not be a bad thing, but it helps to know what’s happening for each calculation at times. This is one reason my team runs our own swerve code and has been improving it over the last several years. We don’t have all the bells and whistles of a library like YAGSL , but we use our code to teach our students and others in our district to understand what the underlying logic and calculations are in a library so that it’s easier to diagnose problems should they arise.",

We can contact the programmer from last season and I can piece together what he did. This season we have a dedicated programming mentor and a couple students. Last season we ran the KitBot, then a custom bot with Rev MaxSwerve and mainly just modified their starter template. That was our plan this year again and we have started down that road.\n\nI knew about YAGSL , but I was always worried it’s too much to take on when swerve in general was new to our team last season and we had 1 active programmer. What would you recommend in our situation? We have our bot from last year still that we could start by converting to YAGSL to practice with over the next few weeks. We don’t compete til week 2. We do plan to eventually switch to other swerve modules later so it would be nice, but it’s not a nessecity at the moment.",
