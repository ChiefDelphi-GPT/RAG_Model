                    "cooked": "My team is currently experiencing issues with one of our Pigeon2s. It seems to be stuck on initialization and does not seem to exit from this mode. As a result, we can’t drive our swerve drivebase without it skewing after a short distance, as I think it is continiously recalibrating while still sending yaw values. We are using the latest Phoenix v5 Library (5.30.3) with the latest Pigeon2 firmware (22.6.2.2) and latest Phoenix Tuner Client (1.9.3.3). The Pigeon2 in question has a manufacture date of 1/26/2022 with a bootloader version of 1.0 and a hardware version of 2.1. It is running off of the roboRIO CAN bus.\n\npidgeon2_stuck_initializing 1920×1020 151 KB\n\npidgeon2_stuck_initializing 1920×1020 151 KB\n\npidgeon2_stuck_initializing 1920×1020 151 KB\n\nWe used this Pigeon2 successfully last year on our robot and did not see this issue, so we believe it is a library/firmware issue with the Pigeon2. Attempting to flash it to the 2022 firmware version did not clear this issue. We also tried to use the Pigeon 2 Mount Calibration option in Phoenix Tuner to see if we could get it out of this state. We have a secondary Pigeon2 we will try to replace it with to see if we can get around this issue temporarily.\n\nI have e-mailed CTRE Support about this, so hopefully it can be resolved quickly. I’m just posting this here to let people know if they are running into similar issue.",

A quick response from @ozrien from CTRE asked us to check the LED state of the Pigeon 2, which we noticed was blinking yellow and not solid yellow, which seems to indicate that the Pigeon is not detected by the CAN Bus/not initialized in code. This seems odd as we were able to read values from the Pigeon 2, which made us suspect it may have been calibrating and sending out values at the same time.\n\nA quick check on the suspicious Pigeon 2 on a testbed didn’t show anything odd and it was now solid yellow. We may investigate this thoroughly again later if we have time.\n\nAs for the Initialization messages, apparently they can be ignored as they are supposed to only be sent by the Pigeon IMU and not the Pigeon 2 and CTRE are investigating it.",
