( Darn my spouse and his adorable puppy eyes asking me to take on programming )  The other mentor is highly technical, but has no patience for beginners or any of the basic bits of programming.  This is probably an off season thing, but welp,  its Dec 20 and we are going to learn during the season now.\n\nHow do you appropriately train/challenge newbies/freshman?\n\nWhat tasks do you give them?\n\nHow do you manage the different amount of help/skill?\n\nAny help on how you organize your programming teams, foster resilience and sustainability, and avoid “the best programmer does everything and everyone else just hand waves” issue would be greatly appreciated.\n\nI’ll be over here knocking dust off my college programming books.  I am not a programmer, nor do I play one on TV, but apparently working in IT (Data and Databases) is the next best thing.",

That can affect the answer of what your short-term plan needs to look like.\n\nHave you chosen a programming language and an implementation (command vs. not command)?\n\nI guess we train new students in the Fall which isn’t really an option for you.  The way our code is structured there are many tasks of varying levels.   So the new students tend to pick up the easier tasks whereas the experienced students pick up the more difficult tasks.\n\nOne technique that I a have found  works well is to pair up students.  This tends to help them resolve issues together (sometimes when they don’t know what to do, they don’t ask questions and if you have enough students, you may not realize they are stuck and with 2 of them, usually one is willing to say I don’t understand where when they work independently sometimes the new students, in particular, assume they are the only one not getting it).",

Most likely using command based, as that is what our legacy code is.\n\nProgramming Team Make Up: I have one advanced level Senior.  2 Juniors who are advanced beginners and are active in other teams, so minimal time with programming.  6 freshman and sophmores with basic beginner skills.  About 50% have some code experience, but none on a robot.\n\nWe will definitely do the pair up.  which gives me 3 or so team/pairs.  My main worry is that if we pair my senior with one of the Juniors, I’m still single threaded in wisdom and experience next year.  Maybe do two-three teams of three?\n\nI’m also inviting local robot programming experts ( Thank goodness I’m in Michigan! @LoganKippnick and 6081 are right down the road )  and finding out their favorite drinks and snacks to lure them occasionally to our robotics center",

                    "cooked": "You can try three person teams (I’ve never tried it with robotics).  It would probably work, though.\n\nI’d probably make three teams as follows:\n\nSenior with 2 freshman/sophomores\n\nJunior with 2 freshman/sophomores\n\nJunior with 2 freshman/sophomores\n\nThat splits up your experience to help the younger/less experienced ones.   You may need to work closer with the teams that have the juniors since they are active in other sub-teams.\n\nI’d give each sub-team a mechanism (subsystem with commands).  If the more experienced one can write the subsystem and the harder commands – at least initially – the others can come up to speed on the easier commands.\n\nAssuming you make your code publicly available before kick-off (if it isn’t already), you can re-use things such as drivetrain (assuming it is the same as last year).\n\nSince you will be learning/training during the season, I’d recommend not biting off complex things (at least initially).   Focus on getting the basic robot up and running and then add to it.   If you have the resources (money/materials and people), I’d recommend getting a chassis bot up (hopefully matching the comp bot chassis as possible) and running for the software team to test on  (make sure drive works, get auton paths working, etc.).  No matter what the game is if your drive isn’t robust, your mechanisms won’t matter.  So make this rock solid and this is something that can be worked on early on.  In fact if you are bringing drive code from a previous year, this is something that you might be able to get your experienced programmer to set up and then have younger ones test it out as well as start mapping your drive paths for auton.  If you don’t have code that you are leveraging, I would definitely have your senior involved in this one.\n\nYou can even put it on blocks and test your mechanisms (e.g. assume this motor is the intake motor and make sure it runs).  The other thing you can do is set up the simulator on your computers and run that way to test before you have a robot.  The key is once you get the robot, being reasonably confident your code will run, so you don’t spend a lot of time debugging/fixing simple problems – you’ll have enough big ones to solve.\n\nIf you will be using CAN devices, I’d have your team get familiar with the Phoenix Tuner if you use CTRE motor controllers or the REV Hardware Client if you use REV motor controllers (our team, in fact, has the electrical sub-team run this to make sure the wiring is correct before turning it over to software.).   You can use these to make sure the motors are going the correct direction and even start playing around with closed loop control constants (I’d definitely get all of you mechanisms working in open loop before getting them working in closed loop as you can start to see how fast something needs to move if it is going to be in velocity control or what position it needs to be at if it is in position control by moving it manually).\n\nYes, it is a good thing to be in Michigan with the density of teams.  We are up the road in Lake Orion.   While we run C++,  we do have Java knowledge, so if there are things we can help you with let me know.",

Teams are great, getting students to bounce ideas and problems off of each other helps so much.\n\nHow to train newbies?\n\nIMO its a great idea to give them a chasis, last years code, a more senior member, and the WPILib docs website on drivetrains & API docs. This helps teach them to read Docs, which is very important in creating independent programmers that can find answers on their own. It also helps senior members teach new members existing code, and the simple ropes.\n\nI struggled a lot with these two things when I first started FRC, not knowing where to look for answers, and not understanding existening codebases.\n\nWhat tasks?\n\nStart small. I know my mentors started us off with giving us a function during build season and saying “here, it should have this input and this output, can you make it happen?” And breaking up the problem like this helps so much. Plan out subsystems, and create functions while leaving it up to students to produce the correct output.\n\nAlso pro tip: familiarize yourself deeply with git, and github and take advantage of the Github Projects feature, this makes it easier to distribute and manage your tasks accross programmers in a centralized way. (By assigning tasks and having advanced project management, this also helps mitigate the top dog from doing everything)\n\nAnother thing that confused me as a new student was no one ever taught me that different vendors individually contributed their own libraries, so make sure to familiarize your students with what your project depends on.\n\nOn a final note: with being crunched to build season, finding practical examples and teaching them how to write (simple) subsystems and commands step-by-step before teaching any advanced computer science theory may be beneficial.",

His advice mirrors how I mentor our team’s programming sub-team.\n\nTo add to their advice:\n\n1.)  I would recommend you pursue MVP (minimal viable product) software first.  Get something that “just works” first.  Doing so will help relieve much of the stress on programming.  Once you have an MVP for each subsystem, you can build in more complex control approaches.\n\n2.)  Hold “stand-ups” with your programming sub-team at the beginning of each meeting.  3-5 minutes top.  Stand in a circle and each person either states what they plan to achieve by end of that meeting, or else you (or your student Programming Lead) assign them a goal to achieve.  (We adults tend to forget, but “deconstructing problems into smaller achievable pieces” is a skill  that is learned via experience and students are relatively new to it.)\n\n3.) At the end of each meeting, hold another 3-5 minute standup and everyone reports their status/progress.\n\n4.) Request from your Design/Mechanical sub-team a list of specific motors, sensors, and understanding of how the subsystem should work, for each subsystem.  Convert how “it should work” into a State Diagram for your programmers.  Have your programmers then learn how to communicate/control with the specific motors & sensors.  Once they’ve done that, have them introduce control logic.  The control logic is what determines whether or not you change the state of a motor or sensor – ie, it controls/decides when and why you transition from one state to another, where “State” is just a collection set of motor speeds, sensor settings, etc.  Around week 4 your Design/Mechanical sub-team should have at least some prototypes that your programmers can work with to then begin to fine tune the motor controls/sensor comms/control-system-logic.  Rinse-and-repeat.  Iterate until competition.\n\nHope that helped.",

ROMI is also great option.\n\nIf last years code is using the CommandBased framework , you’ll want to learn how it works.  It can be a bit intimidating at first, but once you understand it, it will be a huge help!  If last year’s robot isn’t CommandBased…  I wouldn’t take that on right now.\n\nI generally break the team up by Subsystem… most advanced taking on drive, auto, vision.  Least advanced LEDs, pneumatics.\n\nI generally do white boarding session of each of the subsystems calling out the various states and the state changes.  Then depending on skill level work with the students to stub it out in code and/or comments.  For the most junior students…\n\nI find the most difficult part is teaching them how to do source control, merge code, etc. And find myself taking on that task with the help of the programming team lead.  So, most of the time I work side-by-side when something is complete to get it into Github, do the pull request, etc.\n\nKeep in mind that the WPILIB documentation and library is top notch and you should NOT have to write much code to have a functional robot.  The examples are great starting points and the WPILIB vscode plugin will generate an almost functional robot.  So, if you find yourself writing a lot of code…  you may want to ask a question here and somebody will point you in the right direction.  This is an amazing community!",

A sort of “signature” can be developed from sensors such as motor current draw for a given load, velocities, accelerometers to detect vibration, microphone to detect noises. A normal, all-is-well signature is made when the robot is most healthy and then after each match run the diagnostics and compare to the ideal state signature. There has been a recent CD thread about displaying data but I can’t remember its details.\n\nYou can see some examples at matches and open houses such as our neighbor StrykeForce.\n\nThis is an advanced topic that your highly technical mentor should relish getting their teeth into.",

Teach them not just that errors and missed expectations are ok but they are the norm.
