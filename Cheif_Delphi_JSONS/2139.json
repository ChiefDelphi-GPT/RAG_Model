                    "cooked": "We’re thinking about redesigning our practice bot’s elevator this summer so that it uses continuous rigging, rather than cascade .   Mostly this is just for practice, but we’re also looking to see if a continuous elevator is any easier to build or control, especially with more than 2 stages.\n\nWe’ve never built a continuous elevator before, so I’m looking for some OPEX before we start.  Similar to this previous thread , can anyone offer advice on the following?\n\nOur team values reliability, and I saw too many teams with stripped elevator belts this year).  For team that used HTD Belt rigging this year - what worked and what didn’t?\n\nOur team values reliability, and I saw too many teams with stripped elevator belts this year).  For team that used HTD Belt rigging this year - what worked and what didn’t?\n\nMy thinking is dyneema rigging is cheaper and more reliable, however driving rope is a challenge.  The most popular method seems to be wrapping multiple times over a spool made from 1 to 2\" OD tubing (example from team 111 below).  How many wraps do people use?  How do you accommodate the wraps moving left and right?  Has anyone tried eliminating the fixed anchor in the middle of the spool?  (That would reduce the “width” of spool required, but it would need the tension to be consistent to avoid slipping). image 994×750 109 KB\n\nMy thinking is dyneema rigging is cheaper and more reliable, however driving rope is a challenge.

That means the rope always spools off the same points on the spools.\n\nThat looks very similar to how some building elevators are rigged .  Did you have any issues with this approach?  Would you do it again the same way in future?",

Has anyone tried eliminating the fixed anchor in the middle of the spool?\n\nWe tied the rope through a hole on the side of the spool, like the 111 picture, but a much thinner spool, and imagine a small hole in the plates that support the tube shaft. The tube was driven from outside of these rope retaining plates. We didn’t bother to accommodate wraps moving, and were only punished by that if we lost tension in the rope, since our pulley was thin enough it couldn’t walk very far left or right.\n\nIf you have space for it, a turnbuckle in line with the spring is nice, since it makes it much easier to retie the elevator if the rope stretches enough that the spring is useless, or if the rope comes off of a pulley and it is too taut to easily get back on.",

With cascade, an anchor is usually easy because travel is short; not with continuous, unless you do something with a crazy long constant force spring.  BTW, you can find crazy long low near-constant force springs in tape measures. tapeMeasureStringPot 1920×360 60.4 KB That’s an inch and a half of KoP chassis end plate, a bit of aluminum bar, a few machine screws/nuts, a cheap (Lowes IIRC) red tape measure, a black Radio Shack volume knob, and a blue 10-turn potentiometer held together with aluminum bracket we tried to use as a string pot on our 2015 single stage elevator. We didn’t use this in competition FWIW, but it was our inability to build it into something reliable, so perhaps it might inspire in this context.  It was definitely our most ambitious sensor up to that time.\n\ntapeMeasureStringPot 1920×360 60.4 KB\n\ntapeMeasureStringPot 1920×360 60.4 KB\n\nAn advantage of the multiple wraps (counter rotating or not) for your drive pulley is more grip on the pulleys for a given tension, reducing the issue with number 2.  Counter-rotating has the slight advantage of introducing less differential in twist as you go, compared to just multiple wraps.  For multiple wraps without counter, why not just do slightly bigger pulley and lower gearing?\n\nWhile of course you want constant force springs to reduce the amount of work your motors need to do, it seems that the easiest way to maintain tension is to have those springs be intentionally either over- or under- tensioned both under load and non-load condtions.  The choice will likely depend on your start-of-match and end-of-match configurations; make those easy!\n\nAgain, I haven’t done this, but unless you need high tension in those lines, you might want to try natural fibers as well as artificial, because most artificial fibers tend to be less grippy.  Same goes with the pulleys.  Can you use a grippier material, or coat it in something that is?",

It’s easy to quickly wear through it.\n\nAlso, regarding stretch, dyneema doesn’t really stretch once you’ve set it.  So let’s get technical.  High tech lines have ‘creep’.\n\nHere’s a great article on it:\n\n426.13 KB\n\nMost of the dyneema we use in robotics is the lower quality non-pre-stretched versions.  Notice the quoted creep rates.\n\nAt 20% load and .1%/month creep rate, your average run of robot dyneema (let’s call it 15 feet) would creep .18 inches - in a month.\n\nWhat most robotics teams call ‘stretch’ is the knots working in and setting under time.",

                    "cooked": "nuclearnerd:\n\nHow many wraps do people use\n\nAs large of a diameter as reasonable. Larger diameter results in a lower fleet angle which makes things easier. Extra diameter does require more reduction, but its a small price to pay for making the rigging just behave better.\n\nnuclearnerd:\n\nHow do you accommodate the wraps moving left and right\n\nIf your fleet angle is small enough, it should just behave. Helical grooves can be added to the spool to improve spooling behavior with larger fleet angles or in other suboptimal rigging setups and I generally recommend adding them anyways.\n\nnuclearnerd:\n\n(That would reduce the “width” of spool required, but it would need the tension to be consistent to avoid slipping).\n\nI mean you can do this, but I’d rather just tie/clamp the rope off on the spool and never have to worry about if my tension is perfect or not.\n\nnuclearnerd:\n\nI understand that losing tension is what causes rope winches to tangle or slip. What’s the best method to keep both ends of the rope tensioned? Is a ratcheting drum anchor good enough, or do you need a tension spring too?\n\nA spring is required because spools have a fleet angle, resulting in the elevator travel not quite being equal to the rope being unwound. I’ve tensioned rope successfully with as little as a single (stiff) spring and a clamp-off point, but other features can be added to make tensioning easier.\n\nTom_Line:\n\nMost of the dyneema we use in robotics is the lower quality non-pre-stretched versions. Notice the quoted creep rates.\n\nDM20 is also a thing which experiences significantly less creep than SK78/older dyneema fibers. Its a little hard to source in non-boat sizes and quantities, but it will cut down on the maintenance required.\n\nGeeTwo:\n\nWhile of course you want constant force springs to reduce the amount of work your motors need to do, it seems that the easiest way to maintain tension is to have those springs be intentionally either over- or under- tensioned both under load and non-load condtions. The choice will likely depend on your start-of-match and end-of-match configurations; make those easy!\n\nI personally recommend avoiding CF springs on elevators. They are incredibly obnoxious to work with with them being hard (and dangerous) to install, their performance varying significantly depending on how recently you have greased them, and them wearing out quickly due to FRC teams using them outside of specifications. And they don’t even speed up your elevator that much as inertia is a much more significant factor in elevator performance.\n\nnuclearnerd:\n\nWhat other gotchas / advice to you have for working with continuous elevators and/or Dyneema rigging?\n\nThere’s another way of rigging continuous elevators that not too many teams know about but imo is better in many cases than the standard way of rigging elevators. image 1238×872 47.7 KB\n\nimage 1238×872 47.7 KB\n\nimage 1238×872 47.7 KB\n\nFor the small price of spooling twice the amount of rope as usual on one spool, you can mount the spool to the side of the elevator rather than in front or behind, get a 2:1 reduction, power both sides of the elevator, eliminate any synching issues typically associated with powering both sides by using one rope, (knots/clamps not tied perfectly even, hex shaft torsion), reduce the elevator to only one tension point and point of maintaince, and keep all tensioning equiptment at the bottom of the elevator rather than on the carriage.",

                    "cooked": "Our team used a continuous rope lift this year, heavily copying the Rusthounds RI3D . We had 4 different spools, 2 to pull the lift up, and 2 to pull the lift down. The “up” and “down” spools are wrapped in opposite directions.\n\nI would say the most important thing about doing a lift in this style is to have all of your corresponding pulleys match. For example, we had  2 pulleys pulling the carriage up, and both had to be spooled in the same direction. To keep proper tension, each spool also had to have the EXACT same number of wraps and must not overlap. Overlapping spools would create uneven diameters, leading to different amounts of rope being pulled → uneven tension. The spools pulling down on the carriage also had the same idea, but were wrapped in the opposite direction when compared to the “up” spools.\n\nFor tensioning, our down spools were attached to a REV turnbuckle, which was attached to a spring, which was attached to the bottom rail of the carriage. The up spools were wrapped around a screw that had a REV Shaft Collar that was just big enough for a #10 screw. When wrapped correctly, a simple tightening of the screw allowed us to quickly tension the rope.\n\nAnother important thing to consider is the friction between stages. We used REV MAXLift bearing blocks, and had some issues with manufacturing tolerance which led to lots of friction between out stages. To ensure the carriage moved first, we added a piece of surgical tubing to help pull the carriage up. Ideally, a CF spring would probably be better.

Though it single staged, most thing below still applies if this were a multistage elevator. Benefits\n\nDue to how the belts are in between the tubings, it saved quite a bit of space.\n\nI have never experienced creating elevators with ropes, but if the belt is tensioned properly in the beginning, you will only have to retention is once or twice during the season.\n\nVery reliable. Although the belt tension was not the best throughout the season, the elevator never failed to function during matches (even when the spools broke).\n\nChallenges\n\nThe spools inside broke a few times, but this is preventable with strong material and print settings. This was a bit challenging to replace, especially during competitions. Other than this issue (which is preventable), we had no other major problems. We printed the spools in PCABS with low infill, but many teams seem to use CF-nylon.\n\nRigging can be difficult, but this can easily be changed with thoughtful designs.\n\nSince there are slots on the tubings, it takes some time to manufacture.\n\nWe didn’t have issues with the costs of belts because it was a single stage elevator, but if you have more than one stage, the belts are a bit expensive.\n\nThank you for the thread. I learned a lot about elevators using ropes!",

You could probably find out more about it in our CAD Release but we basically have three winches on one shaft, two for ascent and one for descent. The ascent ropes originate on the winches and are rigged through pulleys placed on each elevator stage. The ropes are tied off on ratchets in the innermost stage to make it easier to maintain rope tension. The descent rope is placed on the middle winch and is connected to a small knob on the bottom of the top stage of the elevator.",
