When we do several commands sequentially that involve moving a motor using PID position control, the sequence works.  When we add a command at the end to set a solenoid valve to kReverse (release grip on game piece), then the first command (which is a PID position control commands) initializes, begins execute, but then gets interrupted (goes to “end”) before isFinished is reached.  Nothing moves and none of the other commands get executed.\n\nWe are tying this command to a button “whileTrue”.  I believe we have also tried it by linking the sequential command to the Autonomous command, and it also didn’t work.  We will try “onTrue” today in case there is some issue with setting a solenoid state with “whileTrue”.\n\nAny ideas???",

If the sequence is: 1 - Do stuff 2 - Do stuff 3 - Do stuff 4 - Release Solenoid\n\nThen 1 gets interrupted before completion and the whole sequence is canceled.\n\nAs stated, need to see your code to help you for sure but my psychic debugger tells me that you have a separate command (let’s call it Command B that is requiring the subsystem that owns the Solenoid object. Command B is getting scheduled, and is interrupting all other commands that use that subsystem.\n\nGiven this is a sequential command group, a sequential command group requires ALL the subsystems that are in the sequence. So if Command B does indeed require the subsystem, and it gets scheduled to run while the sequence is running, then it will interrupt the sequential command group.\n\nTo troubleshoot this easily, use SmartDashboard to put all your subsystems to be visible.  The SmartDashboard object will show you the command scheduler for the given subsystem.\n\nOnly do one of those method calls per subsystem so you can better debug your problem.",

These commands are in the Arm and Gripper subsystems.\n\nIf we comment out the third command (which uses the Gripper solenoid), then it works.  After taking out the Gripper command, we can add additional PID commands and they work also.  But once we include the GrabReleaseToggle (or ReleasePiece) Gripper command, then the first command ends (gets interrupted - never gets to finish), and nothing moves.\n\nI read a Chief Delphi blog from a while ago where someone said they had a similar issue, and they found out it was code which had contradictory logic for the solenoid state.\n\nAlso, if we run this sequential command with JUST the Gripper command, it works on its own.",
