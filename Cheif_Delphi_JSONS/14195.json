I’ve been working on a total re-work of PathPlanner for the 2022 season and wanted to get a pre-release out there before the season starts so I can get some feedback on all of the changes. If your team already uses PathPlanner or is considering using it I’d appreciate if you gave the new version a try and let me know if something doesn’t work as expected. Read the Wiki for info on how to use the new version.\n\nPathPlanner 2784×1664\n\nPathPlanner 2784×1664\n\nPathPlanner 2784×1664\n\nTotally rewritten with Flutter instead of electron. The app should perform better on all systems and be easier to maintain.\n\nTotally rewritten with Flutter instead of electron. The app should perform better on all systems and be easier to maintain.\n\nPath generation is now available as a robot-side library. The Java version of this library can function as a drop-in replacement for WPILib trajectories, so it can be used with built-in path followers like RamseteCommand. Unfortunately, the C++ version cannot be used like this, but any C++ code that can follow a WPILib Trajectory can be modified to follow a PathPlanner path with minimal changes.\n\nPath generation is now available as a robot-side library.

This allows for paths like the Autonav bounce challenge to be done in a single path.\n\nAdded the ability to mark a waypoint as a “reversal” that will stop the robot and reverse direction in the middle of the path. This allows for paths like the Autonav bounce challenge to be done in a single path.\n\nInstead of editing a single path file at a time and managing saving them all manually, PathPlanner now opens a robot code project and automatically saves path files into the deploy directory. These files can all be edited, renamed, re-ordered, deleted, or duplicated from within a single PathPlanner window. Now the annoying Edit → Save → Generate → Deploy workflow has been simplified to Edit → Deploy.\n\nInstead of editing a single path file at a time and managing saving them all manually, PathPlanner now opens a robot code project and automatically saves path files into the deploy directory.

Did it have something to do with portability, or was it just what your team already knew?\n\nThere’s a bunch of reasons why I chose to switch to flutter, but I’ll list the biggest ones I can think of:\n\nOne codebase that compiles to a native application for each platform.\n\nLots of built in UI elements, so most of the UI work I do is just arranging the included widgets and making them actually do something.\n\nIncluded package manager that probably has a package for doing whatever you want to do, many of them supporting all platforms.\n\nDart, the programming language used by flutter, is really nice to work with.\n\nIt pretty much just boils down to it being easy to work with and compile for all platforms without having to do anything platform-specific to get it running.\n\nAmicus1:\n\nAlso, is there documentation on the path schema your application exports to robot code? I don’t see it on the wiki.\n\nPaths are saved to .path files in the src/main/deploy/pathplanner directory of the project. These files are JSON formatted and are essentially only a list of every waypoint on the path. PathPlanner paths are Bézier curves so each waypoint has 3 coordinate pairs that describe it (2 for the start and end point). On top of these 3 points, each waypoint contains other info such as the rotation for holonomic drive trains, the velocity override, if the point is a reversal or not, and if the waypoint is locked in the GUI or not. Its probably better to just show an example of a waypoint so here’s an example of a path file with all but 1 waypoint removed:",

Sorry, my question made perfect sense in my head\n\nI overlooked the GUI side velocity limit field, as I incorrectly assumed that kind of feature would be on the robot-code side (since it looks like that’s where the vel and accel limits are defined for the path). Thanks for decoding my intent.\n\nIt may be worth including your explanation above for the “velocity override” field when used on start/end points in a path. Definitely a useful feature.\n\nHope to take this for a spin soon!",

I think PathWeaver is perfectly fine and probably a better option for a majority of teams. I just release PathPlanner as an alternative for people who might like its feature set better. I think I’d say the main advantages at this point are ease of use and holonomic mode. This is just the first iteration of the new version so there’s not much new yet, but moving generation to robot-code will allow me to play around with some ideas I’ve had for a while but couldn’t do in a standalone UI.",

(Not that my team has used either, yet.)\n\nI admittedly have not used either on a real robot yet, but playing around in sims, I much prefer PathPlanner over PathWeaver as PathWeaver repeatedly asks you to save essentially every time you click anything at all, and it’s incredibly obnoxious. PathPlanner autosaves, for better or for worse. I’d recommend creating a git commit between every match if you’re going to be altering paths using PathPlanner during the event, and being very vigilant about the process.",
