                    "cooked": "3494 has made short hex shaft adapters by drilling hex shaft or churro to 8mm and then using this keyway broach and the matching bushing and shim . Using a broach like this in a shaft 6 inches long would be tricky. You’d probably need a custom, extra-long bushing and shim, and you would either have to push the broach all the way through the entire shaft (which would require some sort of drift to push the 5-inch-long broach out when it’s completely buried inside the 6-inch-long shaft), or you would have to insert the broach until the last tooth has gone as deep as you need the keyway to go and then pull it back out. These styles of broaches are not designed to broach very long holes.\n\nBlondihacks has a video showing an alternate technique which is more ammenable to making partial-depth keyways. It’d be pretty fiddly to grind the custom tool for such a small keyway and bore, but in principle could work alright.\n\nHonestly, the set screw idea is a pretty good one. You can do it in full hex shaft (it doesn’t have to be churro), and if you don’t care about marring up the Neo’s keyway and can get multiple set screws exactly lined up, you can drive the set screws into the keyway itself.\n\nIf your team has somebody with decent machining skills, you could take a hex shaft with no hole, drill a small, partial-depth, off-center hole for a makeshift keyway, and then bore the 8mm hole down the center.\n\nIf you don’t care about really messing up the Neo’s shaft, you could cross-drill the hex shaft and the Neo shaft, and press a pin through them both.\n\nWithout any regard for the rest of the mechanism this is going into, the easiest way to connect a Neo to a long shaft is with a shaft coupler. You could create a makeshift one by bolting an 8mm hub to a 1/2\" hex hub. (You would just have to be careful to either get them very well aligned, or leave the bolts slightly loose to allow for some misalignment.)",
