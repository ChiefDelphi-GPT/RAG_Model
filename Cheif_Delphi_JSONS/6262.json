I am doing research at my university, and I’m wondering if anyone has reputable motor supplier suggestions they can really range in price, just wondering if mentors have suggestions as to where to even start looking! Thank you!",

There’s a wide range of sizes, power outputs, and voltage inputs available, and you should be able to find something in the right ballpark for most reasonably sized projects (with exceptions as you get towards either extreme in the size ranges). They won’t have the feature-rich “smart motion” controllers you’re used to in FRC , but that is a market that’s pretty much built up specifically for FRC (and the closest you’ll find in that spectrum is in industrial servo motors, which are a whole different tax bracket).",

I’ll need at least 4 motors, and we’d like to spend less than $2000, have some standardized communication protocal - like CAN or CAN FD, something propriotary would be ok, and NEEDS a software API in python or C++",

Based on it, you might reasonably infer that a significant portion of a motor’s cost is associated with support.  And you’d be right.  Industrial motors are expensive, not because their materials and production processes are, but because they are expected to be durable, reliable, safe, serviceable, and available.  Keeping a plant running requires all of that.\n\nBy comparison, hobby motors are cheap.\n\nWhat will the motors in your research project need to do?\n\n—-\n\nWhat is your supply voltage?",

The fully scaled version will feature a maximum payload of 1000 ish kg with the help of a crane (max speed of 0.1 m/s, so fast, I know ) , and we have funding secured for all of the hardware for that, just scraping together money and making a test bed so we can hit the ground running when that projects starts later this year. We currently use Odrive motors, and while I am remote over the summer, other lab researchers have had difficulty getting CAN working on the motors, and have less experience working with Motor API’s so I’ve been trying to diagnose issues over zoom calls, which is more difficult on the wiring end.\n\nPreferably using DC brushless motors for this project, 120V max, and preferably all the motors could run on the same circuit",

They are able to be driven via PLC or Arduino with relative ease. However don’t expect FRC level of speed adjustment in a hurry. The controllers by default have a capacitor that limits the time for it to register a speed change and the default minimum is 500ms. For driving a two wheeled robot on the ground trying to follow a line this wasn’t going to work at all. Removing that cap will void warranty…\n\nThere is 0 intelligence in the controller for speed control (unless you only use halls due to a lack of encoder input) so it is up to you to close the loop with real encoder feedback.",

They also have high voltage DC and AC servos from China on Amazon or AliExpress.\n\nI would not use an FRC -grade motor for this. They’re not rated for continuous usage at any rated power, so you’d be guessing how much load you can put on them before they smoke. Better to use something actually rated for industrial use. The featureset is very different.\n\nExamples: 400W 110V 1.3 Nm servo with brake: https://a.aliexpress.com/_mrbDEBq\n\nHybrid steppers: https://a.aliexpress.com/_mqrcD1e\n\nClearpath servos: https://teknic.com/model-info/CPM-MCPV-2311S-RLN/?model_voltage=75VDC\n\nThere’s a bunch of EtherCAT servos as well for cheap on AliExpress (< $250 per kit) but they’re 220V so you’d need a transformer. I wouldn’t count that out though. I often look at aliexpress first, then check eBay or Amazon for the same keywords once I know what I’m looking for.",

Being familiar with FRC I thought these things were a given, but after experimenting with a clearpath motor, it doesn’t seem like this trajectory following is built in. Would have to do some kind of velocity commanding to the motor with a position feedback controller. Though they specifically recommend against it. We would like to use tension(torque) control with a position feedback controller, but with our clearpath motors we don’t even have the option to control the torque directly.\n\nStill looking for motor companies that have a feature rich software library that allows this type of functionality.",

They had a great explainer for it in their docs.\n\nWhen the control mode is set to position control, the whole loop runs. When running in velocity control mode, the position control part is removed and the velocity command is fed directly in to the second stage input. In torque control mode, only the current controller is used.\n\nhttps://docs.odriverobotics.com/v/0.5.4/control.html\n\nTheir actual high level control modes do offer a decent variety\n\nhttps://docs.odriverobotics.com/v/0.5.4/control-modes.html",
