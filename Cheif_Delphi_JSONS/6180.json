                    "cooked": "The PhotonVision Team would like to welcome you to the first Offseason Development thread!\n\nThis year, we’re looking to document the great work the community of developers is doing to update and improve PhotonVision in prep for next year. We’re hoping to make some periodic updates as we hit major milestones, and field some Q&A while we’re at it.\n\nThis year, we had an awesome opportunity to present a talk at Championships . As a result a bunch of developers were able to meet in person, get to know each other a bit better, and talk to teams about their experiences this year.\n\nimage 1259×735 76.7 KB\n\nimage 1259×735 76.7 KB\n\nimage 1259×735 76.7 KB\n\nBetween the feedback thread, conversations on the discord , and our in-person chats, we started to form what our summer development priorities could be.\n\nFinally, in early June, we hosted an open call on the discord server to talk through the development priorities with the team, and get a rough assessment of peoples’ availability.\n\nAll meeting notes are available here .\n\nWhile things are always subject to change, here’s some projects that are bubbling to the top of the priority list:\n\nSince day 1, PhotonVision chose an architecture where all timestamp/target data for a frame was packed into a single byte array in network tables. This ensured coherency between different pieces of data all associated with the same frame from a camera. And there’s no intent to loose that.\n\nHowever, maintaining the code to correctly pack the data into an array on the PhotonVision side, and unpack it in the roboRIO it in multiple languages has proven difficult, to say the least. C++ was broken for the vast majority of the season (and no one noticed???)\n\nA lot of different solutions exist for doing this, but all come with tradeoffs. Some bloat the number of bytes, and most are too slow to be used on a roboRIO in a ~20ms loop.\n\nThe current path is to do code generation: A single “source of truth” json file will define the contents of the data packet, and a script will use that json file to generate the Java, C++, and Python implementations for packing and unpacking.\n\nPhotonVision relies on a lot of stuff - Notably, a bunch of npm packages for the front end, WPILib (camera processing, network tables, 3d geometry), and Raspberry Pi / Orange Pi linux images. An important activity is getting these things updated early in the summer, and then (ideally) keeping them stable between fall and the build season.\n\nIn the process, a few tweaks to front-end are in the works to give the user a bit more feedback as to what’s happening behind the scenes.\n\nPreviously, if the coprocessor had a runtime issue where a camera failed to provide a video frame, the net behavior was to keep showing the user the last good frame. This made it hard to tell whether the issue was network latency, something inside the camera, or PhotonVision itself.\n\nThis has been made a bit easier to tell, as “PhotonVision Running but camera stopped talking to me” now produces a specific “Camera Lost” frame.\n\nDocumentation is definitely lagging, and is a key priority for the summer and later this fall. We’ve already burned through one apriltag-only FRC season with examples that still reference retroreflective targets, and this needs to change.\n\nDoc updates will likely take place later in the fall, as we want to minimize churn induced by summer development.\n\nFor now, a pre-step is to move the documentation into the mega-repo to help make it more obvious when a code change needs a doc update.\n\nSupporting arbitrary cameras is… hard. Really hard. We’ll-be-stomping-on-bugs-till-the-day-we-retire hard.\n\nIn an effort to reduce some of this pain, we updated the UI to no longer use an arbitrary 0-100% scale for exposure - rather, the underlying driver is allowed to report its range, and the UI will allow users to directly interact with the number.\n\nThis will hopefully reduce some pain teams saw this year where the slider was either doing weird rounding, or didn’t allow the full range of exposure to be selected.\n\nIn addition, we’ll want to revamp the docs for what cameras are recommended going forward. This will primarily be a function of what cameras play nicely with orange-pi and raspberry-pi linux drivers (which does change year to year), and what cameras developers have tested hands-on (which also changes year to year).\n\nProbably more discussion for a future post but…\n\nYes!\n\nStart by setting up a development enviornment, make sure you can rebuild and run the latest release\n\nFind an issue or fix something that’s been annoying you!

Two main areas of progress on that front:\n\nAt a minimum, we’d like to get away from hardcoding exactly one object detection model, and allow users to upload multiple and select between them (or maybe even run multiple in parallel).\n\nThis would still be tied to OrangePi hardware, though.\n\nMoving past the orange-pi RKNN hardware assumptions will be a bigger update, but there’s multiple other good options available. While PhotonVision doesn’t want to try to “boil the ocean” and support everything, picking a few alternate hardware options and helping funnel people into them is definitely a goal on the roadmap.\n\nModel training remains mostly a “you just gotta know what you’re doing” exercise.\n\nI’m not entirely sure this will change before the 2025 season, and there’s still many “how should PhotonVision make this easier?” discussions needed. At a minimum though, I’m personally hoping we can beef up docs so the enthusiastic team can at least know how to convert into the RKNN hardware format from something else that’s common (yolo?)",

This means that for free we can detect when the interface definition changes, and force users to upgrade only when you actually need to. This idea was borrowed from rosmsg",

I’m hopeful Matt’s serialization PR referenced above helps that effort, while still playing to the strengths of the current development team (which makes C++ - wrappered-to-python difficult still).",
