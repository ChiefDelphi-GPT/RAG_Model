They always seem to become unruly and hard to organize.\n\n-Should we run wires directly through parts of our frame, or should we run them over?\n\n-For CAN wires, what is the best type of connector to use? We always have problems with CAN wires disconnecting, which ends up costing us valuable time.\n\n-Is there an updated diagram for REV components? The current diagram we have doesnt have quite a few of the new components they’ve added.\n\n-New radio advice. I’ve heard horror stories about the new radio and I want to clarify some things before we end up ruining our only radio\n\nThose are all the questions I can think of right now, I look forward to your responses!",

Sure.\n\nI’ve been keeping a close eye on the new radio threads here on CD and to my recollection there have been perhaps 3-4 teams/radios that have NEEDED professional technical support from WCP /VIVID-HOSTING although I do not have official data on that.\n\nI have seen 0 RMA’s needed/posted about on CD ? Maybe 1 early on but my memory is fuzzy?\n\nAnd of the 3-4 above I recall 2 because of user misconfiguration/interrupting the firmware update process - which is something you don’t want to do while updating any devices firmware, like your router…that’s a good way to brick it. And these radios were still recoverable with Vivid-Hosting support.\n\nTo give you some guidance and not CD thread history recollection though: If you are intimidated by the new radio docs from Vivid-Hosting the manufacturer or WPILib , then get your feet wet using the configuration utility recently released that should simplify the process.\n\nId recommend reading up on the VIVID-HOSTING and WPI docs regardless, like reading all the instructions on a test section to be sure you understand what’s going on and what you should expect to happen before diving into it. That will prevent you from landing in many pitfalls like selecting the wrong firmware to update too or not understanding the blinking lights pre, during, or post firmware upgrade.",

We always have problems with CAN wires disconnecting, which ends up costing us valuable time.\n\nThe connectors can’t fail if there are no connectors at all! A good solder joint is always going to be more reliable than any connector. Most of the time, try to solder unless you know you actually need to have a connector for some specific reason (i.e. to swap out an entire mechanism with a pre- wired spare mechanism). Same goes for power wires.\n\nFewer connectors = fewer failure points.",

Whereas connectors allow easy disconnection by design, and each individual connector can have several connections per wire - all of which are additional potential failure points.\n\nI’ve seen dozens of examples of connectors coming apart during matches, or even connectors that are mostly connected but lose contact intermittently - these can be tough issues to find. I think I have only seen 1 solder joint fail, and it was in a place that had been soldered multiple times where a wire was tightly bent around a sharp corner, so it was bound to break at some point.\n\nphilso:\n\nI have worked with teams that had a few team members who quickly learned to solder well. Then those team members graduated. I have also worked with teams where none of the team members could learn to solder well.\n\nSoldering is certainly a skill that takes practice. Just like using a dremel or a drill, most people aren’t great at it on their first try, but with practice it becomes very easy. If you train new members to solder each year, you’ll always have people who are able to solder. Same goes for crimping and using connectors properly - connectors also need careful attention.\n\nMrT8:\n\nI would say yes BUT the ability to swap out components between matches with out breaking out the soldering iron needs to be considered.\n\nI agree\n\nkingbrandon14:\n\n(i.e. to swap out an entire mechanism with a pre- wired spare mechanism)\n\nBut the majority of mechanisms/components never end up needing replacement during an event. Adding connectors to every motor or CANcoder just in case is usually just adding unnecessary points of failure into the system.\n\nAnd if it comes down to it, soldering a couple wires only takes a couple extra minutes in the pit, it’s not impossible to do between matches by any means.",

A solder joint is still a connection that has a chance of failure.\n\nkingbrandon14:\n\nSoldering is certainly a skill that takes practice. Just like using a dremel or a drill, most people aren’t great at it on their first try, but with practice it becomes very easy. If you train new members to solder each year, you’ll always have people who are able to solder. Same goes for crimping and using connectors properly - connectors also need careful attention.\n\nSoldering is a manual skill. Practice does improve one’s skill level. That practice takes a lot of time. There is a significant difference between being able to solder and being able to solder well. A poorly done solder joint will still fail. It is nice that you have been lucky enough to have batches of students who can do soldering to the standards you are happy with. I have only found a few, which is not a sustainable situation. I have worked with other electrical engineers who, after 10-15 years, still are terrible at soldering, often because they have a low level of fine motor control, and ask others to do the soldering for them.\n\nkingbrandon14:\n\nI’ve seen dozens of examples of connectors coming apart during matches, or even connectors that are mostly connected but lose contact intermittently - these can be tough issues to find.\n\nThere are connectors that don’t come apart under the conditions found in an FRC robot. There are ways to secure the wires so that stresses are not applied to the connector or solder joint.\n\nIn many instances, the joint between two wires in an FRC robot will be difficult to reach position. Reaching such positions with a soldering iron becomes problematic and can cause damage to other nearby components. A connector can be disconnected and reconnected much faster and easier.",
