We’ve gotten our kitbot drivetrain to follow paths accurately when driving forward, but when we try and create identical paths that command our drivetrain to move in reverse (having checked the “reverse” box in the Pathplanner GUI), the drivetrain severely underturns.\n\nOur (very pared-down) code can be found here . Simulating it and then looking at Pathplanner odometry should reproduce the bug. To see an identical path working when the simulated drivetrain moves forward, change line 72 of RobotContainer to return new PathPlannerAuto(\"Forwards\");\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas as to how to fix this? I’ve made a bug report on the pathplanner repo because this really feels like it can’t be an issue on our side, but I would love it if someone is able to discover some horrible mistake we’ve made!",

The curvature in the path going forward is at the beginning of the path, with a lower velocity, and lower angular momentum.\n\nThe curvature in the backward path is at the end, after you’ve accelerated to a higher velocity.   Seems like the Ramsete isn’t keeping up with the error on the backward side.\n\nHere’s our repo, it’s Python, but we’re also a WCD using Pathplanner.  I think we’ve had a much better experience using the LTV controller instead of Ramsete. It took a couple of reads of this material to start to get a handle on it .\n\nMy summary reading of that page is seen in our robot.py file.\n\nIt’s a much more tunable experience, less black box, and has worked well in us getting to paths that are more representative of real life.",

We have created two identical autos: one that drives forwards to pick up a note, then one that drives in reverse to go score it, as well as an auto that drives forwards to pick up a note, turns 180 degrees, then drives forwards again to score it.\n\nIf this was an issue of a poorly tuned ramsete controller as you’re suggesting, I would expect both versions of our auto to incorrectly follow their respective second halves. Instead, what we’re seeing is our simulated robot successfully path following when it is asked to drive forward the whole time, but failing to path follow when it is asked to drive backwards.\n\nI’m glad to see another wcd team using path planner!

We do the LTV configuration in robot.py where we register named commands and configure the autobuilder.\n\nWith regard to your Sim code, have you tried running without the PID and FeedForward?  I took a quick jaunt and found that changing your velocity and acceleration constraints aren’t actually changing the odometry seen by pathplanner.  Which is … odd.\n\nUnfortunately, we use CTRE motor controllers on our drivetrain so I’m pretty solid at getting those to update odometry but I don’t really know what or how to interact with the Rev stuff.  Seems weird to me that I’m not seeing any changes overall to the performance of the turns though.  They should be obvious.\n\nWe haven’t added PID and Feedforward to our Pathplanner driving code, just a tank drive method based on volts.  It has worked reasonably well, and we can just use the Q and R elements matrix of the LTV controller to get feeback control without PID .  I’ve not actually witnessed a need for feedforward yet…but who’s to say our paths wouldn’t be much better without it.",
