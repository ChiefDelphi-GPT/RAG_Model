The main reason we want to do this is to help our intake not feed the note accidentally into the shooter. We think Brake Mode will help stop the note from carrying further into our mechanism, allowing us to save time on our auto by always letting the shooter motors run. Does anyone have any experiences with the Neo 550 that would support this? Or would the difference be small?",

This mostly worked but we were seeing a lot of variance and sometimes a note would come in too far.\n\nEvent 2 - we changed to a beam brake sensor on a limit switch. This drastically improved the consistency. I’m not sure what the Limit Switch to the TalonSRX’s polling period is, but its definitely faster than going through software.

Our intake stops very consistently every time.\n\nWe do have break mode on as well, but I’m not sure how much it really makes a difference. It really depends on the mechanics of your system and if that back emf would stop it. With our gearbox on our intake it pretty much stops immediately regardless.\n\nTLDR: maybe think about faster feedback to stop your system?\n\nHow do you control the intake? Is it open loop or some sort of set rotations?\n\nIts not as reliable but you could also look at sampling for inrush current as well if you don’t want to mount a sensor",
