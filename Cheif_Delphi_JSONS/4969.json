I was inspired by @howlongismyname doing the same thing last year and this year and took it as a personal goal to cad a robot as quickly as I could.\n\nAnd so: I present my 2025 REEFSCAPE Robot: WISP Onshape Link\n\nWISP 7009×4955 10.5 MB\n\nWISP 7009×4955 10.5 MB\n\nWISP 7009×4955 10.5 MB\n\nWISP 7009×4955 10.5 MB\n\nArchetype 7009×4955 4.56 MB\n\nArchetype 7009×4955 4.56 MB\n\nArchetype 7009×4955 4.56 MB\n\nArchetype 7009×4955 4.56 MB\n\nFront mount elevator with a funnel to intake coral from hp\n\nFront mount elevator with a funnel to intake coral from hp\n\nLaterator to extend the coral mech to the reef\n\nLaterator to extend the coral mech to the reef\n\nAlgae intake on the back\n\nAlgae intake on the back\n\nDeep climb integrated into the algae intake\n\nDeep climb integrated into the algae intake\n\n110lbs dry weight, 140lbs fully loaded\n\n110lbs dry weight, 140lbs fully loaded\n\nMk4i Swerve\n\nMk4i Swerve\n\n11’’ COG Height\n\n11’’ COG Height\n\nDrop chassis with 3/16\" ground clearance\n\nDrop chassis with 3/16\" ground clearance\n\n16 Motors\n\n16 Motors\n\nDesigned with manufacturing in mind, the only hard-to-make parts are the bent polycarb and the tube support blocks on the climber.\n\nDesigned with manufacturing in mind, the only hard-to-make parts are the bent polycarb and the tube support blocks on the climber.\n\nKeeps cost down, this robot uses only NEO motors and common COTS items\n\nKeeps cost down, this robot uses only NEO motors and common COTS items\n\nUses a common plate thickness, Every aluminum plate is 1/8 thick except for the bumper brackets\n\nUses a common plate thickness, Every aluminum plate is 1/8 thick except for the bumper brackets\n\nCounterbalanced elevator with Constant force springs: Increases cycle times and reduces needed gearing on the drive motors\n\nCounterbalanced elevator with Constant force springs: Increases cycle times and reduces needed gearing on the drive motors\n\nL1 to L4 coral, theoretical cycle times < 1 second (after drivebase lines up)\n\nL1 to L4 coral, theoretical cycle times < 1 second (after drivebase lines up)\n\nRemoves algae from the reef with an integrated roller on the end effector\n\nRemoves algae from the reef with an integrated roller on the end effector\n\nGround intake algae to score in the proccessor\n\nGround intake algae to score in the proccessor\n\nHuman player intake Coral, Funnel means you don’t have to line up\n\nHuman player intake Coral, Funnel means you don’t have to line up\n\nGoal: Maximize points earned\n\nCycle L1-4 Coral as fast as possible\n\nGoal: Maximize Rp earned via coral and algae scoring\n\nCycle L1-4 Coral while removing all algae from the reef\n\nCycle L1-4 Coral while removing all algae from the reef\n\nOnce the reef is free of algae you can switch to algae cleanup or continue cycling coral\n\nOnce the reef is free of algae you can switch to algae cleanup or continue cycling coral\n\nGoal: Guarantee Barge RP without relying on teammates to climb\n\nContinue cycling coral or algae as long as possible\n\nContinue cycling coral or algae as long as possible\n\nDeep climb at the last possible moment, the intake geometry means it’s easy to line up\n\nDeep climb at the last possible moment, the intake geometry means it’s easy to line up\n\nWhen kickoff happened I immediately started thinking about what the most effective ways to play the game would be and considered all aspects of the game I decided that my ideal robot would be able to:\n\nground algae\n\nprocessor algae\n\nl1-4 Coral\n\nHP intake coral\n\nDeep climb\n\nNotable things that I deemed unimportant or unnecessary:\n\nnet algae - avoid the extra complexity to lift or shoot the balls\n\nground coral - 2 hp stations per side mean its unlikely that ground pickup is the only option\n\nshallow climb - deep climb is easier and worth more points\n\ncontrolled reef algae - removing algae from the reef without controlling it means the end effector can be far simpler\n\nThese strategic choices allowed for a competitive robot without sacrificing performance for unneeded complexity and drove the design of my robot. I’m not trying to make the best robot but I am trying to make a robot that i think would be fun to drive. a complex robot that is impossible to drive isn’t fun for anyone involved.\n\nWISP has 7 Major subsystems.\n\n30x30 Mk4i Square with a 1/8\" bellypan\n\nDrivebase 7009×4955 6.07 MB\n\nDrivebase 7009×4955 6.07 MB\n\nDrivebase 7009×4955 6.07 MB\n\nDrivebase 7009×4955 6.07 MB\n\nMk4i swerve\n\nMk4i swerve\n\n30x30 frame\n\n30x30 frame\n\n0.35\" bumper gap\n\n0.35\" bumper gap\n\nmotor controller holders and handles integrated into swerve covers\n\nmotor controller holders and handles integrated into swerve covers\n\n20lbs bumpers for ballast\n\n20lbs bumpers for ballast\n\n2 parallel rollers to grab coral from the funnel.\n\nCoral Holder 7009×4955 5.53 MB\n\nCoral Holder 7009×4955 5.53 MB\n\nCoral Holder 7009×4955 5.53 MB\n\nCoral Holder 7009×4955 5.53 MB\n\nn550 + ultraplanetary for power\n\nn550 + ultraplanetary for power\n\ncantilevered wheels means you can score coral by just pulling the elevator down\n\ncantilevered wheels means you can score coral by just pulling the elevator down\n\npassive wrist attaches to laterator for more flexible scoring\n\npassive wrist attaches to laterator for more flexible scoring\n\nAlgae removal roller\n\nAlgae removal roller\n\n3.7lbs\n\n3.7lbs\n\nintegrated into the elevator carriage for ease of assembly, provides the needed motion to score coral.\n\nLaterator 7009×4955 4.67 MB\n\nLaterator 7009×4955 4.67 MB\n\nLaterator 7009×4955 4.67 MB\n\nLaterator 7009×4955 4.67 MB\n\nsprocket rack for power\n\nsprocket rack for power\n\npassive wrist to mount the end effector\n\npassive wrist to mount the end effector\n\nintegrates right into the elevator carriage\n\nintegrates right into the elevator carriage\n\nunpowered linkage for wiring, inspired by docking drawers\n\nunpowered linkage for wiring, inspired by docking drawers\n\nBelt In tube continuous rigging for super easy rigging and Cf springs for smooth fast motion.\n\nElevator 4956×7009 5.66 MB\n\nElevator 4956×7009 5.66 MB\n\nElevator 4956×7009 5.66 MB\n\nElevator 4956×7009 5.66 MB\n\nBelt in tube continuous Rigging\n\nBelt in tube continuous Rigging\n\nConstant force springs to counterbalance\n\nConstant force springs to counterbalance\n\nCf springs are rigged to Dyneema, keeping them closer to the bottom for better COG\n\nCf springs are rigged to Dyneema, keeping them closer to the bottom for better COG\n\nDirect drive with 2 Motors (the cf springs allow this)\n\nDirect drive with 2 Motors (the cf springs allow this)\n\nSlapdown intake to allow easy integration with the climber while maintaining efficient algae grabbing\n\nAlgae Intake 7009×4955 7.39 MB\n\nAlgae Intake 7009×4955 7.39 MB\n\nAlgae Intake 7009×4955 7.39 MB\n\nAlgae Intake 7009×4955 7.39 MB\n\n125:1 pivot gearing\n\n125:1 pivot gearing\n\ndual motor for pivot\n\ndual motor for pivot\n\nintegrated climber\n\nintegrated climber\n\nfull width, touch it, own it\n\nfull width, touch it, own it\n\ngeometry is easy to line up for the climb\n\ngeometry is easy to line up for the climb\n\nInspired by Rusthounds RI3D , packages nicely in the intake and a central COG means the robot can hang a few inches from the ground\n\nClimber 7009×4955 6.61 MB climbing 4956×7009 4.16 MB\n\nClimber 7009×4955 6.61 MB\n\nClimber 7009×4955 6.61 MB\n\nClimber 7009×4955 6.61 MB\n\nclimbing 4956×7009 4.16 MB\n\nclimbing 4956×7009 4.16 MB\n\nclimbing 4956×7009 4.16 MB\n\nLeadscrew actuated\n\nLeadscrew actuated\n\nbillet aluminum blocks hold the pipes\n\nbillet aluminum blocks hold the pipes\n\nthe pipes could be knurled or to increase grip on the cage\n\nthe pipes could be knurled or to increase grip on the cage\n\nCenters corals after receiving them from the loading station so that the end effector can grab them consistently.\n\nFunnel 7009×4955 5.65 MB\n\nFunnel 7009×4955 5.65 MB\n\nFunnel 7009×4955 5.65 MB\n\nFunnel 7009×4955 5.65 MB\n\nIts a funnel\n\nAttaches the end effector to the laterator to allow efficient coral scoring\n\nWrist 7009×4955 5.33 MB\n\nWrist 7009×4955 5.33 MB\n\nWrist 7009×4955 5.33 MB\n\nWrist 7009×4955 5.33 MB\n\nrotates between 0 -
