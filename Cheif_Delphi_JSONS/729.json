The reason why isn’t because we don’t have enough people, it’s because we don’t spend our build season time wisely. I am trying to change that.\n\nBasically my question is: How do you guys do time management during the build season better and what suggestions do you have to teams that don’t build as fast.",

Also components that may not change much year to year like drivetrain and even bumper design can be done in parallel.\n\nOnce you have a design goal, you would then start creating internal deadlines for each main component and then perhaps a final deadline for build and another for software.\n\nThis also depends on your team structure. I know some teams work around component subteams but 1076 doesn’t split by component, but rather by specialty, so the above strategy works better for us.",

It is a test of process discipline . Put another way, it’s not a matter of what ; it’s a matter of how .\n\nWe are a team who ends build season in a mad scramble. April 2024: “We’re totally going to have the robot ready early so programming can do their thing.” Jan 6, 2025: “We’re going to have v1 of the robot totally ready for programming by Feb 16th.” Feb 26th: “v1 is almost ready and we have 46 hours until load-in opens…just a few more things…”\n\nYour diagnosis is probably at least partially accurate. Getting mechanical to be ready earlier is way harder to do than to say. The primary thing that saved us this year was having a practice bot that programming could use. This was our first year running swerve. This was our first year using vision. (Programming wasn’t exactly totally done and twiddling their thumbs either.)\n\nWhile it’s fresh in everyone’s memory, look back over your actual season and schedule and see what you’d have changed. When doing this, be honest and open about where programming can improve. “We’re perfect and you guys screwed it all up for the team” isn’t going to win friends nor influence people.\n\nWe still have a long way to go; for us, that’s going to look like figuring out how to be better prepared for rapid prototyping and how to use our two-bot platform even better next year.",
