                    "cooked": "A part of me never thought I would make a topic on cd, but I suppose the canon event is inevitable… So let me make this thorough:\n\nA couple of things to note:\n\nWe are up to date on firmware for all sparks. All wires used are new and came with the new motors/sparks which have never been used before. We are using an old Rio 1 and a PDP from CTRE . We just bought a Pigeon 2.0 and also have that plugged in to CAN , though I really don’t think that there is much of a difference.\n\nWe only have 9 IDs on the CAN network, 0 is a Rio 1, 1-8 odd is Vortexs and even is 550 turning motors with an absolute encoder, 9 is a Pigeon 2.0, and 30 is PDP .\n\nOkay story time\n\nWe intend on using MAXSwerve this year, but are currently having some major issues with our motors. Whenever we try to move our motors, they decide they would rather jitter back and forth. My best guess is that this is an issue with the PID , so the rest of this post will explain some testing data that has been accumulated with respect to that.\n\nUpon making two CANSparkFlexs, having one with P = 0 and FF = 1, and the other with P = 0.04 and FF = 1, the one with P = 0 works fine but the one with P = 0.04 start jittering back and forth as seen in this video . D doesn’t affect the extreme oscillation, but reducing the velocity conversion factor (to around 0.00001) in REV hardware client makes it so that the motion is a bit more reasonable, but still not up to speed.\n\nNow while that is strange… what’s really strange about this issue is that it persists even if the settings that were just spoken about were applied but we instead talk to the motor through Swerve.java rather than making it inside of Robot2.java (See Main.java if you are confused on its origins, it replaces Robot.java which we did to try to isolate communication with the motor). Something inside of swerve may be doing logic or changes to the settings on the Flex, but when the same settings are applied inside of MAXSwerveModule (P=0,FF=1), then the motor doesn’t move at all. The PIDFF constants (as explained above) are confirmed to be applied to the motors through REV Hardware Client. The moment we add a P of 0.04, they start jittering again.\n\nOne last quick mention is that the Spark Flex documentation/api just isn’t here yet … Which is why I am resorting to you wonderful people.\n\nNo matter what values are set to the PID , if it was done through MAXSwerveModule.java rather than Robot2.java, it jitters extremely.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions, findings and/or similar experiences. Thank you!\n\n4738",

This issue still exists in Robot2.java when there is a P value to the motor even though there is a restoreFactoryDefaults before the edits to the configuration. Also, inside of getConfigCommand, the restoreFactoryDefault method is called correctly and even has a Timer.sleep() event to ensure that there are no issues with configurating the motor, which was highlighted as an issue in this thread . If the world was perfect and this code worked first try , then getConfigCommand would have been run, but I have commented it since then because I am going a bit insane. I appreciate the help",

If the constructor is removed (doesn’t need any calls to it, it is just the constructor) motors get very angry and start going every which way. I would have thought that this was a CAN bus utilization issue since we have never used Pigeon2 before, but I had thought that it would be fine with a swerve drive chassis… Either way, if there is something I should be doing to make the pigeon happier with me please let me know, I tried using the constructor with a can bus name and set it to “rio” because that’s what phoenix tuner x says when looking at the devices, but do I also need to make sure that the neo motors are on that can bus? I am not using a canivore or anything the connection goes from the pdp to the pigeon to all swerve modules and ends at the rio (which has been upgraded to a rio 2 with persisting issues).",

Addressing: FRC CAN nodes assign ar...\n\nCTRE arbitration IDs are higher priority than REV, so they eat the CAN traffic first. REV devices apparently struggle above 65% CAN utilization when CTRE devices are on the bus for this reason - CTRE uses up most of the bus, and REV can’t handle it for some reason. During initiatlization, you’re probably sending out a bunch of CAN messages that don’t play nice with the REV devices.\n\nThis is hearsay but it makes sense to me. I’ve heard of REV CANbus issues at high bus utilization before, but I’ve definitely heard about it more with Vortices. I don’t have enough devices to test this theory myself, and it seems a little tricky to do well enough to document. I think it’s up to REV to figure out the specifics.",

Device type is higher in the CAN arb ID than manufacturer, and both CANcoder and Pigeon 2 use a higher device type than motor controllers, so those should be lower priority than REV motor controllers.\n\nTo give some more information, we have not done any testing of our own at this time. However, I have worked through the issue with a couple teams to try and narrow down the root cause. One of the minimum reproducible examples reported by a team was under the following conditions:\n\nRemove all CTRE devices from the CAN bus.\n\nRemove all CTRE devices from the robot project.\n\nCall Unmanaged.setPhoenixDiagnosticsStartTime(-1) to disable the Phoenix Diagnostic Server (and also load the Phoenix libraries in the process). At this point, only our enable frame should be sent over the CAN bus.\n\nAdditionally, so far we have not had any reports of failures with the SPARK MAX, only the SPARK Flex has had issues.",
