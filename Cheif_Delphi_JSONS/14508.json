It just seems like adding another layer of things that could go wrong, but I don’t really know pneumatics well. Our darts this year also caused many issues at our first event, which is the main reason I am asking this now.\n\nMy questions are, how significantly does running pneumatics help teams? And how difficult is it to do pneumatics for the first time?",

                    "cooked": "Pneumatics are intimidating. I’ve had plenty of students shy away from them in the past because they don’t truly understand them. There’s definitely a learning curve involved into both how to create a functional pneumatics system as well as designing systems (particularly linkages) to use them effectively. There’s also a lot of initial investment into getting pneumatics onto your robot.  You need air storage, a compressor, pressure regulators, and gauges before you can even worry about putting a solenoid valve and pneumatic cylinder on your robot.\n\nBut pneumatics open up a massive design space to teams, and once you’ve mastered the basics you’ll never look back. Spend some time this off-season reading the FRC manual to get an idea for what is involved in a pneumatic system, read up on some of some pneumatics manuals (note - some rules changed since this was written), and build a pneumatic system to practice with. That system doesn’t have to be on a robot, it can be on a piece of corkboard or plywood, it’s just to teach you what each component does and how they interact with one another. As a bonus, it will let you do all sort of pneumatic prototyping and testing in the future.\n\nAs a design principle, my $0.02 is - if you’re only doing “one thing” with pneumatics you can probably avoid a pneumatic system on your robot. But if you need to do 2 or more “things” with linear motion or pneumatics, then it’s worth installing a pneumatic system. The biggest design cost of pneumatics is the initial system installation, but once that’s already factored in, adding additional solenoids and cylinders is relatively minor and allows you to add plenty more features and movements into your robot for minimal cost. It also allows for motions that don’t occupy additional slots on your PDP/PDH.",

If I was still in FRC, I’d probably still be using them.\n\nWe always shyed away from pneumatics since weight was a concern, as well as potential leaks being a big issue. We messed around with them in the off season prior to 2019, and decided to run them during season. We had a PTO gearbox, intake actuation, as well as a claw for cargo and hatches that also used pneumatics to extend. We later added in the season some mechanical pneumatic brakes for our climber, as well as some extra force to extend another part of our climber; so across many aspects. Out of 2 districts, state and world’s, we never lost a match due to pneumatics, and I truly believe the design of robot we made could not have been done without pneumatics.\n\nA big thing we considered when laying out our pneumatics was that leaks only really occur at joints/ connections. Less connections, less leaks. Rather than having a lot of small tanks for air, we used a 1 gallon aluminum tank from ARB so we minimized a lot of connections there. We also used manifolds for solenoids rather than individual solenoids.\n\nThe only two issues we had with our pneumatics that season was our pressure relief valve, and our pressure switch for the PCM. We tried used a pre-set pressure relief valve from McMaster Carr, but learned that for some reason after blowing once (which is required during inspection), it would continue to blow at a pressure lower than the cutoff. Our pressure switch for the PCM also broke a wire at world’s, and took us a second to realize that was our issue.",

Some years you may have a lot of little parts that need to move, and being able to just stick another cylinder somewhere is convenient. Other years you might have a simpler design with few moving parts, in which case you might not need pneumatics at all.\n\nThat said, over the past few years I’ve been preferring to omit pneumatics whenever possible. I’ve become a fan of the light-fast-simple robot; less parts and less weight and less stress and more fun.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that all of the work that your pneumatic system does comes from the compressor, which is not a super powerful motor or efficient method of storing energy. I would avoid using pneumatics for major components that need to do a lot of work. I’ve worked with three robots that used lots of air for major components (1726 in '08, 842 in '14, 842 in '16. All catapult robots). Each one has had a point where we were starving for more air in at least one match.\n\nTry adding a pneumatic system to your robot this summer to get experience!",

                    "cooked": "Pneumatics can be intimidating. There is a whole new set of things to understand (from basic plumbing techniques to programming) that do take a while to figure out.\n\nThere is a layer of “overhead” associated with adding a pneumatic system to the robot such as the compressor, storage tanks, regulators and manifolds that carry a certain cost and weight. However, once you have invested in that overhead, each new actuator that you add to the robot comes with minimal cost and weight such that you quickly “pay for” that overhead in terms of the overall robot cost and weight. If you are only going to actuate a single action with the pneumatic system, it may not be worth it (depending on how easily you can perform that same actuation using motors, gearboxes, etc. But by the time you have 2 or 3 or more actions being done using the pneumatic system, it is pretty much going to be worth it.\n\nPneumatics have limitations in terms of the types of actions that they are good at. But for linear actuation between two fixed points, pneumatics tend to be a much better choice than motors. by utilizing bell cranks or linkages, it is easy to turn that single linear actuation degree of freedom into a lot of useful types of motion.\n\nLeaks are a reality that you have to be prepared for. But, just about any system has “gotcha” aspects that you need to be prepared to address, so there is nothing more or less tricky here. It is just a new set of “gotchas” that you need to address. There are several “best practice” ways to manage leaks in the system. First off, build up your core on a bench before mounting it to the robot to make sure everything is leak free. This includes all the components from the compressor to the manifold (regulators, tanks, pressure relief valve, pressure switch, etc.). By pressurizing the core system on the bench (even to a relatively low pressure of 10 or 20 psi, you can see if it is holding pressure and hunt and fix the leaks before you bury that core into the bowels of the robot. Using soapy water and a rag or brush, it is easy to wipe down each of the joints and find the leaks (leaks cause bubbles in the soapy water mixture). Once you have a leak-free core system, then you want to add each actuator to the system one at a time and test it to make sure that new system is leak free.  You also want to make sure you are using a proper tube cutter to cut your tubing. Tubing that is not cut properly is generally the biggest cause of leaks.\n\nI agree with others that you want to try to build up this new expertise on your team during the offseason. Building a pneumatic demonstrator is a great way to learn about the system. If you incorporate a bunch of linkage type mechanisms and bell crank actuated mechanisms, you can learn about how to design with pneumatics. This project can be combined with a CAD camp and a camp where you learn about the machine tools and a programming camp to have an end-to-end learning experience for the team. The older students who are helping to teach the skills they already know (CAD and machining) will then become the students as you learn about pneumatics.   You can use some of the types of mechanisms out there in other teams’ CAD to understand how the mechanisms work and how to select the actuators that you are going to use to perform a given task. In the end you will have added this technology to your bag of tricks so that you are ready to use it if it makes sense to do so in an upcoming seasons",

Old, non-competition grade batteries that are nonetheless still functional are good for this. The bigger issue is the compressor itself.\n\nIf you have huge air tanks, then the poor little thing has to run and run and run to fill them up every time you drop below the “fill” threshold, and compressors generally aren’t designed for that kind of duty cycle so it gets really, really hot (and really, really inefficient)…but if you don’t have enough tanks then the robot doesn’t function when you need it to. [I do wish FIRST would let teams charge pneumatics with a second off-board system, but alas, they don’t and haven’t for a long, long time, so we live with overtaxing the poor little thing.] Hitting that sweet spot of “we always have enough air but the compressor isn’t on for two minutes straight” can get a little tricky.\n\nIt’s certainly not enough of a concern to avoid pneumatics altogether. A heat sink on the compressor can help, as can fans, though not as much as using the “right” amount of storage rather than aiming for overkill…and to be honest, we’ve never done either of the former two, though I’ve seen teams that have.\n\nPerhaps the best argument I can give for using pneumatics is that it lets you start the game with additional stored energy on the robot. You’ve already got chemical energy in the battery and elastic energy on any stretchy things, why not also have compressed air? 120 psi in, say, two one-liter tanks is over 1600 joules of additional stored energy that can be piped to mechanisms all over your bot.\n\nOnce you start using pneumatics, you’ll wonder why you didn’t start earlier.",

It had a good elevator, pretty good drive train, ok climber, but we struggled mightily with intaking game pieces consistently using only motors/springs.\n\nFrom that robot on we have always budgeted for pneumatics from kickoff and have not been sad that we made that decision.  There are almost always a few functions that are better suited for pneumatics.  Intakes, brake deployment, shifters…\n\nThat being said as an inspector I love it when teams do not use pneumatics.  It takes about half the time to do a complete inspection.",

It is fairly easy to build an excel spreadsheet that determines the volume of air that is consumed for each actuation of a cylinder. You can either run the calculation at the working pressure of the robot (which is fine as long as you never drop below that regulated pressure) or you can run the calculation in terms of standard cubic feet which I recommend since then you can include the compressor performance in the spreadsheet (all the FRC compressors will list their performance in terms of SCFM [standard cubic feet per minute] at different pressures, so you can quickly calculate the time it will take to replenish the tanks). Once you determine the volume of air used per actuation, you can calculate how much the pressure in your storage tank will drop (I’ve approximated this in my spreadsheet using a derivation of the ideal gas law PV =m(Rs)T. By holding T constant at room temperature, setting V to the volume of the clippard tank, you can calculate the mass of air in the tank, m(Rs) (mass of air times the specific gas constant for air) for the air in the tank before actuation using the initial storage pressure, P, and then calculate the P after actuation by subtracting the amount of air used per actuation from the original mass and solving the same equation for P. I’ve found that this gives a pretty accurate representation of what happens in most FRC pneumatic systems. Since it is in a spreadsheet, you can easily make the number of tanks a variable that you can play with to see what happens to P in your storage tank as you use the stored air.\n\nIf you “right size” your cylinders in terms of diameter and stroke to produce the forces you need (i.e. don’t over-build), you will find that you can cut down on the air volume used quite a bit and, unless you have some really large bore cylinders or you are actuating a large number of cycles per match a single storage tank is usually sufficient.",

It’s a super useful tool in the FRC toolbox. Highly recommended to learn. Agree teams should also look at incorporating constant force springs, gas shocks, & even elastic tubing.",
