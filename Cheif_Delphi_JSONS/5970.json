Some combination?\n\nThe poor efficiency is mainly a result of friction. Motor peak efficiency is largely a function viscous and dry friction, where motors are dissipating minimal power through the internal resistance. An ideal motor would have 100% efficiency at free speed, dissipating no power through the resistance, which means friction significantly hinders efficiency as the extra torque required to spin is both not useful output and causing the resistance to dissipate more power. Using free current times kT as a proxy for friction, the neo vortex has much more friction, explaining the poor efficiency.\n\nLower kT is not necessarily a bad thing in a vacuum, because it is almost 1:1 correlated with kB because motors are gyrators, with kB determining free speed. In fact, idealized motor models assume both quantities to be equal. Because the vortex is a lower kB motor, it has a higher free speed, and must necessarily have a lower kT as a result. However, kT being lower then kB is a result of electromagnetic inefficiencies and would indicate design issues.",

As soon as you put a gearbox on it that goes out the window.\n\nIf what you care about is the Nm/A for the output of the gearbox you can basically dial that number to whatever you want by adjusting the gear ratio.\n\nAs Alex_Y said, peak efficiency is largely dominated by the viscous friction of the bearings in the motor (and other friction/drag sources) so that isn’t a particularly useful metric for comparison either.  The Vortex has much larger bearings than other motors and so has a lower peak efficiency number.  Under any kind of load it will perform similarly to other motors though.\n\nA better metric for comparing motors is the mechanical power produced by the motor.  Peak power is useful but with modern FRC motors the peak power point usually has a large enough current draw that it’s not sustainable on an FRC robot.  Mechanical power at a given current (e.g. 40A, 60A, 80A) is a pretty good way to compare.  You have to be careful to look at the correct current range that you care about, which isn’t going to be the same for every mechanism on your robot.",

                    "cooked": "kV * kT is a global constant for these motors. Winding a motor for more torque per amp proportionally reduces speed per volt. The difference is that if you wind for a lot of torque, you’re using a lot more thinner wire, so resistance goes up. When resistance goes up, stall current goes down, and your peak power also decreases proportionally.\n\nThis is why historically the 775pro was so powerful despite being just another brushed motor. High speed meant less wire length, less resistance, and higher stall current. Of course, modern brushless motors are even more powerful, but that’s just the modern reality.\n\nFun fact: knowing only the resistance of the windings of a motor and the supply voltage, you can find its approximate peak output power by using the equation V^2 / R / 4. Stall current is equal to V/R to make this even easier, just V * I / 4.\n\nKraken stall torque is 366A. Using 12 * 366 / 4 we find a power of 1,098W. The official spec measures it at 1,108W - within 1%!",

For custom mechanisms you probably are looking for peak efficiency at the speed and torque you are using, and the through bore design certainly has its upsides.",

This is especially the case if you start crossing into territory where the speed of the motor requires adding additional stages of reduction.\n\nEven though kT * kV is constant there is a reason to play with the balance between the two.  Increasing kV is done by reducing the number of wraps in the winding.  With less wraps, you can use a larger cross sectional area for the conductor which reduces the winding resistance.\n\nFor example, if you halve the wraps, you halve the kT and the winding resistance.  With half the winding resistance you get double the stall current.  That puts the stall torque right back where you started, albeit at double the current.  The key thing here is that you kept the stall torque the same but doubled the speed, which effectively doubles your peak power.\n\nBasically for a given voltage and stator design, peak power is proportional to kV.\n\nThis is STRONGLY limited by thermal considerations.  That along with the limitations of the FRC power system in delivering huge currents and my above comments about not wanting to add a huge amount of gearing to your subsystems means the kV needs to stay within reasonable bounds.",

                    "cooked": "Conservation of energy.\n\nI’m gonna explain this using the back-emf constant, kB, which is by definition 1/kV, but makes much more sense from a theoretical perspective.\n\nLets assume you have a motor with a kB of 1 V-s/rad and a kT of 1 N-m/A with a resistance of 1 ohm. At 12V, you’d have a peak power draw of 36W which occurs at a voltage differential of 6V. On the output, you’d be outputing 6 N-m of torque at 6 rad/s, also resulting in 36W.\n\nNow lets say you have a magic motor that has a kT of 2 N-m/A. Under the same electrical draw, you’d be outputing 12N-m of torque at 6 rad/s, meaning 72w of output power, at 36w of input power, which obviously can’t happen.\n\nIf energy is perfectly conserved, kT and kB are necessarily equal, which is what is taught in intro dynamics classes and commonly posted on spec sheets, including brushed FRC motors from the OEMs. However, in the real world, you will often find motors with a lower kT than kB, meaning that there’s electromagnetic inefficiencies or inefficiencies in the control method (trapezoidal or imperfect FOC implementations).\n\nAlso on a side note: it annoys me that FRC manufactures don’t post the fundamental motor constants directly, unlike pretty much the rest of the world that isn’t selling cheapo motors. Its not only easier to explain motor performance using the fundamental constants (rather than stall and free speed characteristics as a proxy), but those same constants directly show up in the models used to simulate and control things involving motors.\n\nOrion.DeYoe:\n\nBasically for a given voltage and stator design, peak power is proportional to kV.\n\nIs it reasonable to change a motor’s backEMF constant without physically changing the windings of the motor? I’ve always thought of motor’s peak power mainly being a function of resistance (assuming no thermal issues), where changing the kB/kT is just changing what that peak power looks like.",

Peak power for the Vortex occurs at around 25A and 250W (mechanical output), which I would count as “any kind of load”. And as others point out, while the power difference is pretty minimal, the heat is somewhat significant.\n\nThat said, I don’t know how much of a difference this makes in real world situation. A fair comparison would include a powertrain attached to a mechanism. The flexibility of the Vortex, including the 7T gear shaft, seems useful for having fewer reduction stages and therefore higher efficiency.\n\nAlso, efficiency isn’t everything; compared to NEOs you need fewer Vortexes to achieve the same power if both motors are geared for peak efficiency. Compared to Krakens, I think Vortex’s numbers are worse, but I don’t think the difference is big enough to sway that decision.\n\nPatrick3357:\n\nHigher speed can definitely be an advantage when powering COTS mechanisms like swerve modules, where you cannot change gear ratios freely\n\nThis argument’s never seemed significant to me. In almost all FRC use cases (i.e. everything except for a tightly packaged shooter) we are gearing the CIM -class motors down so lower free speed/higher torque is better. That said, as mentioned above, Vortex has the 7T shaft which is useful in this regard. SDS modules have gear ratio options that are more than fast enough even for NEOs.",
