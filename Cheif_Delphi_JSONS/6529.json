One thing that we really struggled with this past season was figuring out the logical divide between commands and subsystems.  As an example, this past season my team had a shooter with variable shoot speed, shoot angle, and feeder wheel speed. We had “presets”—combinations of shoot speed, angle, and feed speed—that we had tuned to be accurate for each side of the speaker. I decided to implement these as enumerated states within the shooter subsystem, and only have the set of possible enumerated states accessible through its public API. Looking back, this was a bad decision, because we also wanted to move the climber manually at times, and adjust the setpoints during a match, and take manual control of the motor to reset it, and all of this meant we had to set up a complex chain of logic within the subsystem that was hard to control and resulted in a lot of complex and tangled state between the subsystem and its commands. But, to this day, I’m not sure if putting all the state in the commands would really have been a better option due to the amount of data that should really be encapsulated within the subsystem. I have recently seen teams such as 2910 who use a superstructure abstraction which centerally manages the state of every subsystem and allows commands to request a state change through it, rather than interacting with the subsystems directly.  This seems good, but aren’t there cases where having only one possible state could get really unwieldy?  Like, say you’re in the auto-shooting state but you want to put the climbers up, for example.  Do you need one state for AutoShooting and another state for AutoShootingAndMovingClimber?  It seems like you could easily end up with dozens of states which have a lot of redundancy Anyway, I’d love to hear your thoughts.",

We transitioned this year from primarily relying on running commands in our “transitions” to running “StateCommands” instead, which made the transitions somewhat useless…\n\nPotentially in the future we’d move to just assuming all transitions are allowed and only explicitly defining transitions when we need a specific action for a specific combination of transitions, and/or setting any disallowed transitions that should be presented. Does that sound like a reasonable idea?",

There are pros and cons to this example. Maybe others here will suggest the ideal way. In a too quick of a look I didn’t notice a table lookup type of problem solution in @Jedi_4 . Maybe they solved it.\n\nYou didn’t hint at how many enumerated states you have and that could drive the technique to use.\n\nIn this example the field is divided into three shooting zones and the Xbox controller right trigger axis simulates where you are shooting from. It needs the usual Main and Robot loop with RobotContainer instantiation. It runs in simulation, too.",

I commend you on a program that can be read and fairly well understood without much time-consuming effort.\n\nUse of the short form of commands, also, should help readability somewhat.\n\nJedi_4:\n\nmove to just assuming all transitions are allowed\n\nI didn’t notice you checking the “from state” before “transitioning” to the “new state” so maybe you already allow all transitions?\n\nI agree that many transitions are unique to a “from” and “new” state combination so checking “from” isn’t useful. Games that allow the robot to handle multiple game pieces are likely to benefit from some robot internals limited use of the “from” - “transition” - “new” for game piece storage and shuttling control.\n\nJedi_4:\n\nspecific combination of transitions\n\nI think you mean specific combination of states (from state - transition - new state).
