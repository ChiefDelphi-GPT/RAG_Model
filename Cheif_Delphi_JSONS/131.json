Without a functional, reliable L4, most teams struggle to compete effectively. Unless you're expecting to form your own alliance, most teams hope a top-tier alliance will pick them over others—would anyone realistically choose a robot that can't run L4?\n\nIn my view, your team should continuously improve your robot throughout the season. There are likely features your current robot can enhance or overcome its limitations. Start working on that now.  \n\nHowever, it’s easy to stick with what works due to laziness, distractions like prom, or other activities. Motivation can wane as the season progresses.\n\nStill, if your goal is to win, you need an L4. Dismissing advice won’t help—you have to act if you want results. If you’re just having fun, consider how frustrating losing feels. In 2012, we were one of the last teams in Galileo with a non-functional robot, and despite knowing the issues, we didn’t fix them. Back then, testing was challenging, and many teams lacked practice bots.",

While L4 and Barge are essential at Worlds to perform well, the time we have right now is limited. Adding a new stage to extend your elevator is risky—it might require manufacturing new parts, purchasing new components, wiring, and programming. There are too many variables to manage, and even if you complete the elevator, your robot could become inconsistent due to rushed construction, which is often frowned upon during alliance selections.\n\nInstead, I suggest improving existing parts and fine-tuning auto operations to ensure each subsystem runs consistently—about 10-12 times without issues or minimal errors. This consistency can help achieve the luck needed to excel at CHAMPs.\n\nIf you aren’t going to CHAMPs, it’s up to you. Skipping the elevator upgrade will save time for other activities and preserve parts for next year. However, completing the elevator upgrade could be a good off-season project to teach new or returning members new skills.",
