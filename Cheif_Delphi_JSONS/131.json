Most likely, All of the other Coral robots will be able to do L4.  Unless you expect to have your own alliance, you’re like most of us, hoping a big-name-team will pick you over the others.   would anyone pick a robot that can’t do L4?\n\nI’m personally of the opinion that your team should continually be improving your robot throughout the season. There are things your robot can do or do better that you know about.   Start doing them.\n\nBut there’s always a lot of inertia to keep it the same.  Kids are tired of building things.  Prom.  Jobs.  Warm weather activities.\n\nYes, you should do L4 if you want to do well. Do you need to listen to me? Nope.\n\nIf you’re just going for the ‘fun’ just think how much fun losing is.  In 2012 we were robot number 100 of 100 in Galileo.   It was really discouraging.  And we didn’t fix our known-problems.  my excuse might be because in those days you had to ‘bag’ your robot and working on it was really hard.  we didn’t build a practice bot.",

While yes L4 and Barge are somewhat of a necessity at Worlds to do well, the time it takes at he current moment of writing this is to champs is quite small. Adding a new stage to lengthen your elevator is quite risky. You would have to manufacture new parts, maybe need to buy new parts, and wiring and possibly programming as well. There are too many factors that need to be worked on that even if you get the elevator done, your robot could be inconsistent due to rushing to get the elevator built, and inconsistency is often looked down upon in alliance selections.\n\nI would recommend trying to improve existing parts and autos trying to get what you already do to a more consistent level having each one run around 10-12 times without breaking or with a negligible amount of error. This can offset any luck needed to do well at champs.\n\nIf you are not going to champs, I would say its up to you. Not doing the elevator upgrade can save you time to do other things such as doing stuff outside of robotics and also saves parts for next year. However, doing the elevator upgrade can prove to be a great offseason project to get new or existing members aquainted to new skills.",
