It seems very powerful, has a lot of IO in connections of the board (JST PH 2.0mm pitch  and a micro:bit connector)\n\nThis kit includes a UNIHIKER single-board computer and a stylish Black Silicone Case, which provides a platform for learning Python, coding, and innovation.\n\nPrice: 82.9000 USD\n\nIt seems a lot easier than trying to do an SBC, display, etc. in individual components.",

There are two co-processors that are very popular in FRC the Raspberry Pi & the Orange Pi because they are popular there is more support for their processors. If you want a display on a co-processor, I would highly recommend something like a 4D systems display on a raspberry pi. That gives you the network based connection co-processors like along with some sort of on-board display.",

A number of people are locked into the Raspberry Pi universe and don’t look at other devices.

I’m messing around with a combo N100 (Windows and Linux) that has a onboard RPi2040 chip (GPIO using Micropython).\n\nIt’s a solution to a few problems, are there other things it can be used for.  I’m kind of a fan of “complete unitization”.  This is a board with a screen and a SBC as a single unit.

I’m kind of a fan of “complete unitization”.  This is a board with a screen and a SBC as a single unit.  It’s not a Pi with the screen as a hat where I need to worry about outside forces moving things around.\n\nUsing all the flavor of Pi boards from the very first Pi B, the rats nest of wires makes me twitchy.  It’s fine on my build desk, not so much out in the wild.  Any more I will use a Grove Base Hat or similar to break out the cables.   (I’m a fan of “under hats”, I’ll put long pin GPIO connectors on the Pi, so I can put hat’s under the Pi.  So for a non FRC robot, the stack would be {motor hat} {motor hat} {Pi SBC}{grove connector hat}\n\nThe Unihiker comes prebuilt with connectors on it.   It also has the micro:Bit board edge to allow more pins to get pulled off of the SBC.\n\nOn an FRC bot I would think about it as a little touch console for a last min look and setup of what internal values.   During build season being at the robot and being able to look right there is helpful.\n\nOf course anything that you could do with a RPi based board.\n\nI know lots of teams look at things in the off season, and was interested if this popped up on someone’s radar.",
