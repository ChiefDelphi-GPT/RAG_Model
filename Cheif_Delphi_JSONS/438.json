                    "cooked": "So, powering a robot using an extension cord instead of mains power. At a recent outreach event I noticed we were frequently running out of batteries, often killing old ones by overdraining them. I wondered if it would be better to simply plug the robot into the wall rather than relying on batteries.\n\nThe first thing I considered was the spike in current draw. Most wall outlets in the U.S. operate on a 15A breaker at 120V, providing 1800 watts. FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) robots typically run on a nominal voltage of around 13V. Calculating the required current, 1800W divided by 13V equals approximately 138.46A. While this is theoretically within the 120A limit for FRC competitions under constant load, during normal operation, the current draw exceeds these limits significantly.\n\nFor an outreach event, it seems feasible to keep current draw below 138A with appropriate settings. However, I'm unsure if the motors react negatively when power is returned to the system via an AC-to-DC converter. I may need to verify this assumption.\n\nWhat do you think? Has anyone successfully used mains power to operate a robot? If yes, how was it implemented?",

I understand this remains a limitation.  \n\nCurrently, I have a TUNS300F12 power supply, which is among the most compact 12VDC units available; it offers 25A of current, similar in size to an Altoids tin. By fitting six of these into a battery enclosure with appropriate cooling, you could achieve 150A of output. These supplies are 85% efficient, so they should work well with a 120V 15A circuit. Additionally, purchasing them for around $200 each makes them cost-effective to keep a battery in parallel, though logistical challenges remain with the new 12/3 cable required now.  \n\nIt’s worth noting that 13V is too high; most robots operate on 12.8V batteries after adjusting for surface charge. The 120A breaker used in FIRST Robotics Competitions (FRC) matches the energy consumption of a robot over time, as I’ve never experienced a power outage during extensive practices. Therefore, maintaining a parallel battery ensures consistent power supply as long as the average draw stays under 120A.",

You could build up an active zener with a serious power transistor that could do the clamping. Using a diode and a significant capacitor is a better method if you are trying to kill the peak. Add a resistor across the diode to keep the capacitor voltage near battery voltage when its not active. A power zener or an active zener/clamp circuit across the capacitor would be smart too. Though with normal capacitors is easy enough to buy them in 24 Volt rating. Calculating the energy clipping capacity needed is probably do-able, but it depends on a LOT of things, many of which we only know roughly.",

                    "cooked": "On my unit, I'm using an active rectifier module, also known as an ideal diode. It has additional smart features along with a normal diode and a large MOSFET. When power is initially passed through the diode, it charges a capacitor. The smart component then activates the MOSFET, reducing the forward voltage across the diode nearly to zero. The capacitor's voltage decreases gradually. Once it drops too low, the MOSFET shuts off, and the capacitor recharges using the diode's voltage drop.\n\nI purchased this model: [link]. Another version includes a ground terminal for continuous operation but has more limitations compared to the first.\n\nA large shottky rectifier could work, providing approximately 11.9 volts on a 12-volt supply. A regular large diode might suffice, delivering around 11.3 volts.\n\nThis supercapacitor module requires critical balancing circuitry; avoid unintended shorts. These modules can handle high currents like melting wires.\n\nThe 83-Amp power supply is sensitive to certain conditions, shutting down in protest during operation. Be cautious with applications involving high current outputs, as they may melt small wires or cause issues.\n\nFor the dimmer bulb, ensure the output drops to zero when turned off. It serves as a useful indicator of operation. Obtain it from your local auto parts store. Navigating the frame ground can be challenging; consider seeking a module with two actual wires if possible.",

                    "cooked": "Understanding resistor selection is crucial for effective braking systems. The three key parameters are resistance, power rating, and energy rating. Peak power rating relates to energy, so identifying the appropriate resistor based on these specifications is vital. Heat sinks require the resistor's peak current to stay below 80 Amps, necessitating a minimum resistance of 0.15 Ohms, equating to a maximum power dissipation of 960 Watts. Instead of assuming a 1kW resistor, wirewound resistors are preferred due to their ability to handle short bursts of higher power. Using four 0.8 Ohm resistors in parallel provides redundancy and protects against failure. Current sense resistors, typically 0.1 Ohm, can be configured in series or parallel for optimal performance. Specialized braking resistors are designed for high-energy applications, though some may not meet 12V operational needs. Calculating energy dissipation involves accounting for the system's kinetic energy, aiming for efficient energy transfer rather than loss. Alternative strategies include stead loads, where steady-state power is wasted during pulses. For tethered robots, speed limitations apply, whereas flywheels and elevators can reach full speed. Advanced resistors with energy ratings offer solutions for extreme conditions, such as 500 Amp pulses at 5kV, requiring careful current control to prevent damage.
