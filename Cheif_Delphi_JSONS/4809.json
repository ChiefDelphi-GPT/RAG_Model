I recently “finished” solo designing our team’s robot for Reefscape, and want some design review to point out any flaws and get some help with solutions for them as this is also my first full robot design.\n\nHere is the Onshape link.\n\nScreenshot 2025-01-21 211053 882×714 300 KB\n\nScreenshot 2025-01-21 211053 882×714 300 KB\n\nScreenshot 2025-01-21 211053 882×714 300 KB\n\nAbove is a screenshot of the CAD in it’s current state. It mainly consists of 5 major mechanisms: the coral ground intake, the elevator, the end effector, the climber, and the elevator.\n\nScreenshot 2025-01-21 211322 963×593 230 KB\n\nScreenshot 2025-01-21 211322 963×593 230 KB\n\nScreenshot 2025-01-21 211322 963×593 230 KB\n\nThe coral ground intake is modeled off of this prototype from team 340 and 1678’s OTB intake from last year. Most of it is a pretty standard slapdown intake, but I’m not 100% confident that I modeled the deadaxle pivot correctly and I still need to figure out the mounting for the motor that will power the pivot. It also has a separate mini-indexer that will reorient the coral and store it for the handoff to the end effector. The pivot is powered by a Kraken X60 and the rollers will be powered by an X44(when we get ours).\n\nScreenshot 2025-01-21 211255 636×711 159 KB\n\nScreenshot 2025-01-21 211255 636×711 159 KB\n\nScreenshot 2025-01-21 211255 636×711 159 KB\n\nThe elevator is a sideways( #sidewayselevatorgang ) cascade-rigged FRCDesign.org type lift, making use of various parts from TTB and WCP . I’m fairly confident that this design is sound, and the carriage also houses a pivot for the end effector. It’s powered by two Kraken X60’s on a 12:1 reduction and can reach up to score directly into the barge with the end effector angled up. I haven’t modeled hardstops(because I’m lazy) or the bracing for the elevator(because I’m not entirely sure how to go about it in this case.\n\nScreenshot 2025-01-21 212112 866×611 242 KB\n\nScreenshot 2025-01-21 212112 866×611 242 KB\n\nScreenshot 2025-01-21 212112 866×611 242 KB\n\nThe end effector is modeled after the manipulator prototypes from 4522 and 2383 , being spring-loaded(surgical tubing not modeled) and able to grasp both coral and algae. I’m vaguely uncertain about this design as we haven’t prototyped it due to not having surgical tubing yet, and I think it could take a few more revisions to reach where I want it to be, however 4522 seemed confident that this style of manipulator could work well, so I plan to stick with it. The pivot for it will be powered by 1 Kraken X60 and the wheels will be powered by a CTR Minion(if we ever get ours ).\n\nScreenshot 2025-01-21 212731 1048×613 165 KB\n\nScreenshot 2025-01-21 212731 1048×613 165 KB\n\nScreenshot 2025-01-21 212731 1048×613 165 KB\n\nThe drivebase is a pretty standard 28x28 swerve chassis using MK4ns(because those are the modules we ordered in the preseason). It’s very low detail right now because our electrical lead is figuring out where to put everything with the very limited space I’ve given him to work with.\n\nScreenshot 2025-01-21 213046 856×625 107 KB\n\nScreenshot 2025-01-21 213046 856×625 107 KB\n\nScreenshot 2025-01-21 213046 856×625 107 KB\n\nThe climber is ripped straight from the Everybot CAD, with some very minor tweaks to the winch. This is very much an eyeballed drop-in, and I’m not entirely sure if the cage will be able to go far enough into the robot to lift us. Our robot’s CoG is currently near dead center(give or take 1\"). I’m also watching 4522’s climb concept , as our end effector may not be able to ground intake algae and it looks like this would fit inside our constraints a little better than the everybot climb.\n\nThe current robot weight is sitting at just about 100.5lbs(unless I’ve accidentally hidden something in Onshape).\n\nWith that, the robot tour concludes and here are some of my more pointed questions:\n\nThings I know could use some work:\n\nElevator bracing(currently nonexistent)\n\nUse of MAXSpline on the carriage pivot\n\nEnd effector packaging\n\nThings I’m not sure about:\n\nHow should I brace the elevator when the end effector pivots out in the way it does?\n\nClimber is directly dropped in from the Everybot CAD-not sure if it’ll work\n\nSome of the hole patterns on tubes don’t line up on the elevator-is it possible to assemble it in it’s current configuration?\n\nHow should I go about placing electronics in this(or rather how can I jam the major components into the space I have?)\n\nHow can I tension the chain on the carriage and intake pivots?\n\nDid I do the intake pivot “correctly”(in a mechanically sound way?)\n\nThings I don’t know are wrong with this design:\n\nHoping you all can help me out with this one\n\nThis is also my first super long post here on CD , so I hope I did this right! Thanks to anyone who takes the time to read this and double thanks to anyone who takes a look at the design!",

I can go through things in greater detail (more of the “why”) later if you wish.\n\nIn 340’s prototype you linked, there seem to be some lower rollers and the whole contraption intakes coral at a shallow angle (as in it may be difficult to get coral over the bumper).  I am not saying what you have in cad won’t work, I am saying that it looks a fair bit different.\n\nAs your design basically hinges around this working I would focus my energy there.\n\narjunorsmth:\n\nI’m fairly confident that this design is sound, and the carriage also houses a pivot for the end effector.\n\nThis in itself I would consider a major mechanism. These are not a small amount of work to pull off, a carriage pivot was about 50% of my 2019 season (granted I was learning a lot at the time). These things have loads in 6 degrees of freedom and can be a pain.",

There is also a bottom kicker roller which is pretty well obscured in the screenshot I posted. I’m not 100% confident in the reliability of the indexer though, as we’re still waiting on our star wheels to ship.\n\nI also agree that the carriage pivot will be a lot of work to get right. Just going off of your experiences with 2767 in 2019, what would be your advice on pulling one of these off? Persistent issues that y’all faced? Thanks for taking a look at the design.",

You will also probably need an extra sensor in there if you cant have a 1:1 on the encoder.\n\nAs far as advice: spread loads out. We never had an issue with things binding and  think you will be ok here, but the larger you can get with things the less “slop” can sneak in. It looks like you are doing a good job not relying on positions of the end effector pivot that would be susceptible to basklash.\n\nI also see your end effector is pretty substantially cantilevered. I would double down on the spline interface with an extra scab plate to help with the loads. If you can get the motor opposite the wheels to help balance it that would be helpful (although this would impact your starting config and may not be possible)",
