We also have auto-navigation working reasonably well, including dynamically generated trajectories. The question I have - what do you think would be good strategies for the notes? The point is - because the detector will generally give you a Positive for the partially visible note, I am not sure that the horizontal size of the target box is a good indicator of a distance from camera to the note (thoughts on that?)\n\nHere are some examples I could think of:\n\nSee the note - turn intake to the note, run towards the note with low, medium or high speed, depending on the possible distance with the intake out and ON. The downside - for partially visible notes the distance would be perceived larger than it really is. So, the turn needs to be done first and then the run. Also visibility of the note needs to be re-evaluated in case it was missed or disappeared. I have seen that LL3 can do so with 80fps, which is very impressive. We have LL2+, and get about 30-40fps on that with Coral. Not bad, but could be better.\n\nJust turn towards the note and leave the rest to the drivers\n\nIndicate there is a note, but do not do anything\n\nAny other strategies you can think of that can automate note pickup? If you had some luck with the distance detection, and can share the code or at least a strategy, that would be much appreciated as well.",

All our auto-driving commands for teleop are interruptable (you let go of the button - the robot stops), so we have safety in mind. However, I am still debating whether to pickup the notes.\n\nThe point is - our drive in teleop by default is field-centric. So, even if I turn the robot towards the note, that’s not going to do much for the drivers, except they can switch to robot-centric and just drive forward (we have that as well). So, my question is - whether just turning the robot towards the note improves the cycle speed in any way. I mean - it’s interesting feature, but from a usability point of view did not seem that critical. Thoughts?",

With multiple notes we had a little increase of lag, but not terrible. Also it seemed not to affect detection of at least one of the notes, even if one was partially on top of the other.\n\nHow do you feel about medium-speed drive towards the note? We decided not to deal with A* path, so just a straight path. Our intake (over-bumper) is likely to survive a lite-to-medium head-on hit, and has separate protection against side hits. We also moved most major components, such as motors, off it (at the expense of additional belts, less space for electronics etc) to try and make hits less damaging.\n\nWe will have SmartDashboard indicators that a note is visible.",
