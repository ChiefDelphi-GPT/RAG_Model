The only issue is that, being new to FRC and robotics programming in general, I have no idea how to call the methods that would extract the data from the robot and upload them to the SmartDashboard.\n\nIf anyone else has done a vision system that uploads telemetry to SmartDashboard or something similar, how would one go about doing this? Where would I place the function calls? My first thought would be something like the periodic method calls in Robot.java, but I was informed that that wasn’t great because of potentially inconsistent calls.\n\nAny help is appreciated, thanks.",

Just put those same variables on the SmartDashboard if those are the values you want to see.\n\nSince this probably doesn’t answer your question post your code and tell us what LL values in your code you want on the SmartDashboard.\n\nPieyama_Pieman:\n\nMy first thought would be something like the periodic method calls in Robot.java, but I was informed that that wasn’t great because of potentially inconsistent calls.\n\nPeriodic software is how the robot is controlled. Generally to maintain consistency you get all of your inputs at the beginning of the loop iteration, do your calculations and then toward the end of the loop iteration do the controls, logging, and monitoring displays. I’m only guessing here that’s what you are concerned with. For example, getting a mechanism’s position more than once in the loop iteration may get two different values which often is not what you want for accuracy. Exactly what were you told about inconsistent calls and are trying to avoid?",

In the mean time put it in your robotPeriodic() {} . I would call a new LL update method that contains at the least this code moved out of the class instantiation:\n\nThen call each of the other methods as you need to get the values.\n\nThat seems to be the minimum to get you going but I’d tweak what you have a little.\n\nFirst I’d check to make sure you have a new, valid set of data from LL with code similar to other LL data double valid = tv.getDouble(Double.NaN); then check for + or - 1. .\n\nNormally you would try to get all of your inputs as fast as possible at the beginning of the loop iteration and not do extra calculations until needed. Still, I see value in doing all your calculations early on since there aren’t many. That way all the information you need is calculated once at the right time and is always available anytime in the entire loop iteration. As it is now you have to make sure you run all of the calculation methods before the data is available for the SmartDashboard posting.\n\nSo I’d make a second method for all the calculations that you run immediately after all of your sensor inputs for the iteration. Then I suggest running telemetryUpdate() at the end of the iteration. If you are plotting your data then the telemetryUpdate() is fine but if it’s numbers for human consumption, displaying once every 50 or so iterations is adequate and much more efficient.\n\nYou could end up with something like this:\n\nYou could take a look at THIS example but caution! The Robot class is correct and works to view a USB camera and detect an AprilTag and compute the pose and display the pose (much more code than what you are going to use - my team probably will use the roboRIO for vision this 2025 season). The LL class has NOT BEEN TESTED! I’ve been working on updating to better methods and do not have a LL at home and haven’t used the current LL helper. The code is similar to what you have, does validation, displays data (after debugging if that’s needed), and maybe there are better LL methods to use now than what I use.",
