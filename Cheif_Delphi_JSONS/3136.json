Additionally, this worked perfectly fine for the first portion of this year, as well as during the start of the first competition we competed in in Belton this past weekend. However, after our second match, our gyro mysteriously stopped working. I initially thought it was a hardware issue. I went through steps such as: swapping gyro, and swapping the roborio. Both steps failed. Then, yesterday, I added a print statement into our code that tells us if the gyro is connected, System.out.println(m_gyro.isConnected()); . This code printed out “true”. Following this, I tested again, and yet again, nothing changed, it was still broken. We go into competition this Friday at San Antonio, and would love to see our field relativity work again to help us with our autonomous, as well as our driving. If anyone could provide me with some help, that would be greatly appreciated.\n\nGithub",

                    "cooked": "Kade:\n\nHowever, after our second match, our gyro mysteriously stopped working.\n\nHow did you determine this, what behavior was the robot exhibiting that brought you to this conclusion?\n\nWithout knowing exactly what it was doing, it’s hard to know exactly what may be wrong. I see that the gyroscope is connected, that’s a good sign. Could you maybe add the following lines to your DriveSubsystem.java periodic() method?\n\nAs the robot rotates, this will hopefully show meaningful (or not) values and give us a better idea on where to look. I used SmartDashboard because you can right click on the box containing the numbers and turn them into graphs, but you can also switch them to system print statements if you would like.\n\nA few questions about the above numbers:\n\nDo they start at 0, or some arbitrary number?\n\nIs their change consistent with the rotation of the chassis and gyro?\n\nDo they do something odd if the number goes (or tries to go) below 0 or above 360?\n\nIf the above numbers correspond with what is happening physically, even after the robot rotates multiple times, ignore the rest of this post. If the numbers seem funny, maybe try the following:\n\nI took a look at your code and I didn’t find anything super obvious. The only possible issue I found is that you feed resetPosition() and update() a Rotation2d object that isn’t bound between [0,360) degrees.* I.e. I wonder if a value of 743 degrees (as an example) is causing problems later in the match. I would imagine that the method would be smart enough to know what to do with values outside of the unit circle though.\n\nTo ensure this isn’t the issue, you may try replacing Rotation2d.fromDegrees(m_gyro.getAngle()), with Rotation2d.fromDegrees(m_gyro.getAngle() % 360), to ensure exiting the unit circle isn’t the issue.\n\nThe code I’m refencing is here:\n\nreturn m_odometry.getPoseMeters();\n\n}\n\n/**\n\n* Resets the odometry to the specified pose.\n\n*\n\n* @param pose The pose to which to set the odometry.\n\n*/\n\npublic void resetOdometry(Pose2d pose) {\n\nm_odometry.resetPosition(\n\nRotation2d.fromDegrees(m_gyro.getAngle()),\n\nnew SwerveModulePosition[] {\n\nm_frontLeft.getPosition(),\n\nm_frontRight.getPosition(),\n\nm_rearLeft.getPosition(),\n\nm_rearRight.getPosition()\n\n},\n\npose);\n\n}\n\n/**\n\nAnd here:\n\n);\n\n// // Usage reporting for MAXSwerve template\n\nHAL.report(tResourceType.kResourceType_RobotDrive, tInstances.kRobotDriveSwerve_MaxSwerve);\n\n}\n\n@Override\n\npublic void periodic() {\n\n// Update the odometry in the periodic block\n\nSystem.out.println(m_gyro.isConnected());\n\nm_odometry.update(\n\nRotation2d.fromDegrees(m_gyro.getAngle()),\n\nnew SwerveModulePosition[] {\n\nm_frontLeft.getPosition(),\n\nm_frontRight.getPosition(),\n\nm_rearLeft.getPosition(),\n\nm_rearRight.getPosition()\n\n});\n\n}\n\npublic ChassisSpeeds getChassisSpeeds() {\n\nSwerveModuleState[] states = new SwerveModuleState[] {\n\nIf you get some time, let me know how that goes and I’ll try to provide more help if it doesn’t work.\n\nBest of luck in San Antonio this weekend. My team will be competing there too.\n\n* Technically rotation 2d is based in radians, but I’m using the example of [0, 360) because you call fromDegrees(angle) .",
