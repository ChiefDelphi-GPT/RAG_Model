                    "cooked": "A couple of our team’s batteries have been spiking down to 6V during matches and they started at ~13V. This has caused some parts of the robot to not be sufficiently powered at times. We have swerve drive and 2 of our turn motors (NEOs on the left side of the robot) are spiking a few times at ~83A drawn, which never happened in other matches or previously. For comparison, our drive motors (Krakens) have been drawing up to 60A.\n\nWhen these turn motors were making those spikes, we didn’t seem to be doing anything that should have warranted such a high draw. These motors are current-limited: smart limit at 40A and hard limit at 80A. We don’t seem to have any shorts. Nothing feels hot either. When we spin the motors by hand, there isn’t atypical resistance and there isn’t debris either that could be causing friction. I don’t believe our motors were fighting each other either.\n\nSome things that happened when things were insufficiently powered: slow movement, LEDs flickering, robot jittering, slower spinning for our shooter and intake wheels.\n\nWe tested our batteries with a battery beak and they seemed fine (it said the battery health was good). The battery connection also seems good.\n\nThe wiring to those motors also seems to be good (though we may have missed something).\n\nThis has been happening in most of our matches but not all of them today.\n\nDo you have any ideas on what could be causing our batteries to often dip into ~6V or what we can do to temporarily stop this issue until our competition is over?",

Does it need to be greased? Do the swerve modules look damaged? Have you tried swapping motors or modules around? I.e. swapping modules 2&4 or turn motors 2&3. Is everything wired correctly? Is the situation easily repeatable? If so, is there a possible pattern? Can the programming team solve it? (You never know. Can’t hurt to ask them) Can you replace the modules and/or motors? Do the motors still spike when taken off the robot and run? Have you asked other teams at your event with swerve about possible solutions? I’m just listing things here. Hopefully, it’ll help.

Even a small ramp rate on of about 10-20ms can make significant improvements on current draw.  Somewhere in the 60a range is probably reasonable for a stator limit for the turn motors, smart current is a stator limit if memory serves so you should be good there (id even guess 40 is lower then you want, though depending on the trip time you set it might be ok).\n\nWhat are the internal resistances of the batteries (from memory, you generally want it to be less then 0.18 ohms)?",

I have, on occasion, seen motor or controller failures that present with similar behavior but no obvious mechanical cause.\n\nAnother thing we’ve encountered before specific to swerve drives is issues that only present themselves when the robot is on the ground, thus making it almost impossible to diagnose on a cart. This usually involves a components of the serve module that either binds or moves out of position when weight is applied to the wheels, but operates normally without weight. In the case of the SDS MK4is, we saw this kind of thing last year when we added a custom “lift kit” to our swerves to get more ground clearance; our kit did not properly emulate the profile of the parts it replaced, thus allowing the rotating “core” of the module to push up into the robot when weight was applied and misaligning the gears in the process, causing binding. We only discovered the cause of the problem when someone happened to push up on the bottom of the module while checking an unrelated issue.",
