These include:\n\nA club introduction event will be held, and the application form will be prepared and submitted.\n\nGeneral training about the team, FRC , FIRST , and the overall process.\n\nWorkshop rules training.\n\nStudents who fill out the application form will be subject to an interview, and team recruitment will begin based on the results.\n\nAfter students are recruited to the team:\n\nA 1-2 month training and trial period\n\nMechanical materials training\n\nSoftware training\n\nHand tools training\n\nElectronics training\n\nPR training\n\nOur projects, events, and training sessions\n\nSponsorship acquisition\n\nAwards, applications, and documentation\n\nDesign training\n\nAfter completing all these processes, the necessary eliminations are made, and the main groups are determined. This finalizes the core team of AG Robotik.\n\nMain Training and Application Processes:\n\nDesign workshops\n\nElectronics workshops\n\nSoftware workshops\n\nMechanical workshops\n\nCanva workshops\n\nThroughout this entire process, the primary responsibility of all team members is to develop project ideas and secure sponsorships.\n\nAfter the kickoff, our team outlined the team had decided what we should do throughout the season:\n\nGame Manual Review\n\nBrainstorming (Week 1)\n\nPrototyping, testing, and starting the design process (Week 2)\n\nCompleting the design and beginning production (Week 3)\n\n75% of the robot completed (Week 4)\n\nRobot completion and start of trials (Week 5)\n\nSoftware and mechanical adjustments (Week 6)\n\nMotivational Events\n\nGame day\n\nBowling\n\nPicnic\n\nAmusement park\n\nCinema\n\nNew Year’s gift exchange\n\nBeginning of Robot Prototyping Our robot manufacturing journey begins with creating a wooden prototype, One of our primary focuses during this phase is testing different shooter designs. Shooter, Feeder Prototip 1200×1600 252 KB One key aspect of this phase was testing different shooter and feeder systems together, as integrating both functions efficiently is crucial for our robot’s overall performance: To avoid any game pieces getting jammed inside the robot, we decided to move forward with this design. AG Prototip notalı 1200×1600 238 KB After getting confident with the design we decided to begin prototyping the intake. we envisioned an intake over-the-bumper system built around a series of wheels. These wheels would be designed to increase grip toward the center, ensuring secure handling of the game element which started to look like this: Intake deployed AG prototip 1200×1600 309 KB After lots of “intaking”, we needed to ensure they were efficiently transferred from the intake to the feeder. To achieve this, we incorporated additional wheels to assist in the transition. which made our prototype look like this: AG prototip intake covered w plank 1200×1600 311 KB\n\nShooter, Feeder Prototip 1200×1600 252 KB\n\nShooter, Feeder Prototip 1200×1600 252 KB\n\nAG Prototip notalı 1200×1600 238 KB\n\nAG Prototip notalı 1200×1600 238 KB\n\nIntake deployed AG prototip 1200×1600 309 KB\n\nIntake deployed AG prototip 1200×1600 309 KB\n\nAG prototip intake covered w plank 1200×1600 311 KB\n\nAG prototip intake covered w plank 1200×1600 311 KB\n\nAfter testing each part of the prototype—intake, feeder, and shooter—independently, the next step was to test everything together as a whole system. We moved the robot to our practice field and began full-system trials. AG Prototype in Field 1008×1792 126 KB During our tests, the robot was performing well, and the system seemed promising. With that progress, we moved on to the next steps: adding a climbing mechanism and incorporating an adjustable angle into the shooter mechanism.\n\nAG Prototype in Field 1008×1792 126 KB\n\nAG Prototype in Field 1008×1792 126 KB\n\nAfter a few days of effort, we found a solution that perfectly suited our robot: a custom 3D-printed herringbone gear. This specialized component helped us address key design challenges and improve the overall functionality of the robot. Once the gears were printed, our software team worked on the necessary interpolations to ensure smooth operation🌶️.\n\nWith these improvements in place, we transitioned from using wooden prototypes to aluminum parts, making our robot more robust and ready for further development.

After several trials, we decided on a new mechanism that better suited our robot’s needs.\n\nNow, our focus shifts to the software side. We are working on using LED indicators to provide the drive team with real-time information about the robot’s status. Additionally, we will be integrating the climbing mechanism to enhance the robot’s overall functionality.

We will spend the coming days fine-tuning our driving skills and strategy to ensure we’re fully prepared for the Bosphorus Regional competition.\n\nAfter the Competition\n\nAs with any competition, we faced a few challenges and setbacks during the event, but overall, it was an incredible experience. We made it to the finals, where we competed against Barker Redbacks and Istanbul Wildcats. Although we didn’t take home the win, our performance was strong, and we learned a lot from the experience.\n\nOne of the major highlights was our robot’s 5-note autonomous combined with 3-note far side autonomous, which worked beautifully throughout the competition. This showcased the precision of our robot’s design, giving us a competitive edge on the field. one key takeaway was the need to improve our amp mechanism.\n\nA clip for our far-side Auton:\n\nup left (also because of a field error the match was replayed)\n\nLooking Ahead to Marmara Regional\n\nAs we move forward toward the Marmara Regional, there are two key areas we need to improve: achieving a faster climbing and amp mechanism and making the shooter more stable and faster. These improvements will be crucial in enhancing our overall performance.\n\nOur goal is clear: to secure a win at Marmara and earn a spot in the championship. With these upgrades, we are confident that we can reach the next level and compete with even greater success.

One of our rotation motors’ drivers burned out, and we faced significant challenges in the driving section. Fortunately, we managed to fix the problem just before the practice matches ended, and everything started to look more favorable for us.\n\nBy the end of the qualification matches, we ranked 4th, and 9483 invited us to join their alliance. Together, with our alliance, we consistently scored over 100 points, ultimately winning every single play-off match. The must-seen thing happened in Playoff Match 11, we executed 11-note autonomous flawlessly.

Based on the feedback we received, we decided to redesign our shooter, improving its efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, we have started adapting to the meta-strategy known as ferry or passing, which has proven to be highly effective in the competition scene.\n\nBy implementing these changes, we are confident that our robot will perform at an even higher level as we prepare for the championship. ag going to champs 1200×1600 167 KB (the photo was taken at 3 am )\n\nag going to champs 1200×1600 167 KB\n\nag going to champs 1200×1600 167 KB\n\nChampionship Day 1\n\nWe’ve officially settled into our pit and took a team photo to mark the start of this exciting event. The next four days are sure to be full of challenges and excitement for all of us!\n\nUnfortunately, we hit a small setback right away—we couldn’t make it to our practice match because the radio we were provided with was faulty. Luckily, we were able to get it replaced quickly, and we’re ready to move forward with the competition.\n\nChampionship Day 2\n\nAfter getting our radio up and running, we headed to the practice field before our qualification matches. The trials went smoothly, and we were quite satisfied with the robot’s performance. It was a great way to build confidence before heading into the real matches. ag practice 1600×1200 275 KB\n\nag practice 1600×1200 275 KB\n\nag practice 1600×1200 275 KB\n\nRobot is looking good\n\nEven though our robot performed well, we only managed to win 2 out of 5 matches. We didn’t get the results we were hoping for today, but we’re staying positive and aiming for better outcomes tomorrow. With a few adjustments, we’re confident we can turn things around. image 779×265 35.3 KB\n\nimage 779×265 35.3 KB\n\nimage 779×265 35.3 KB\n\nChampionship Day 3\n\nAfter a team meeting last night, we started Day 3 feeling much more motivated. We headed back to the practice field for one last test run before our matches. Today was a slight improvement over yesterday, although still not where we hoped to be.\n\nWe managed to win 3 out of 5 matches, which was a better result than yesterday, but there’s still room for improvement. We’re pushing forward, staying focused, and ready to give it our all for the final day. image 771×195 29.4 KB\n\nimage 771×195 29.4 KB\n\nimage 771×195 29.4 KB\n\nChampionship Day 4\n\nThe final day of the championship arrived, and although we were a bit late to alliance selection, we weren’t too worried since we finished 44th. To our surprise, 6th alliance captain 1731, and their first pick, 5712, selected us to join their alliance.\n\nUnfortunately, during our first playoff match, our intake broke, which was a bit of bad luck. We quickly replaced it with our backup, but we lost in the third match and got eliminated.\n\nWe want to give a huge thank you to 1731, 5712, and 1501—it was an incredible and unique experience for our team, and we learned a lot from it!\n\nEnd of Season\n\nWe’d like to extend our heartfelt thanks to everyone who helped and supported us throughout the season. Your contributions made a huge difference, and we couldn’t have done it without you.\n\nWe are more than happy to answer any questions you may have, and we’ll be sharing information about off-season competitions soon.",
