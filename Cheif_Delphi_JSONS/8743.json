                    "cooked": "Hi, ChiefDelphi!\n\nTeam 694 StuyPulse is building the 2024 KitBot and we want to share our progress with you! We expect to have it done by the end of the week (ambitiously, I think Wednesday). We’re excited to use the KB-2024 as a training and testing resource for our members. We also anticipate that a lot of the robots that will be needing help from PulseCrew, our service team, at the regional level will be using the KB-2024 and it’s in our best interest to have hands-on experience with the robot.\n\nWe’re an OnShape team, and at the moment it doesn’t seem like the KB-2024 is going to be up on OnShape until Thursday. Like I said, we want the robot done this week. This means I’ll be uploading the Solidworks files into our team OnShape for students to mess around with, and we won’t be able to benefit much from the OnShape-native KB.\n\nEDIT: The OnShape-native KB was hiding! We have it now and will probably put out a link to our modified version later in this thread\n\nIn the interest of getting our 2024 KitBot built as quickly as possible, we opted out of the Drive Base tote and prepared an old (best guess 2017?) AM14U drivetrain in the fall. Ours is in the square configuration, where the KitBot build guide recommends the long configuration. This means our internal mounting space is 2” wider (measured IRL and in CAD) than the 18.25” wide space the KitBot is designed to fit in. Currently, our plan to handle this is to change KB-24001 and KB-24003, the vertical and diagonal box tubing supporting the shooter, to be 2x1” box tubing rather than 1x1”. Because the KB-2024 structure is only about 18.75” deep, we won’t have to modify it in that dimension to fit on our chassis. We’ll also be using NEOs where the KB-2024 has CIMs.\n\nimage 1071×1091 236 KB Old AM14U. Internal mounting area measures 20.25” across and 24\"ish front-to-back. Source: trust me bro I measured it real good\n\nimage 1071×1091 236 KB\n\nimage 1071×1091 236 KB\n\nWe are also interested in using our KB-2024 to test different note shooting angles. This will probably involve drilling out a more complicated hole pattern in the rails mentioned above so that we can shift the angle up and down manually for testing. Updates to come.\n\nHere’s what we’ve done. Kickoff weekend for us is full of big team discussions about main robot strategy, so KB-2024 construction starts Monday.\n\nGet the KOP , take inventory, confirm that we got everything in the Black Tote that we’re supposed to (we did!)\n\nMeasure the KB-2024 Solidworks CAD and talk through the necessary adaptations to the design to fit on our AM14U\n\nUsing the 10 provided drawings as a baseline, start marking off what we have, what we need to modify, &c\n\nimage 1192×591 105 KB KB cutlist, from Slack last night\n\nimage 1192×591 105 KB\n\nimage 1192×591 105 KB\n\nFeel free to reply to this thread with questions. We’ll let you know when we make more progress on altering the box tubing parts, hopefully tonight, and will post more updates once we’re actually manufacturing.",

                    "cooked": "Not much progress was made on the KB today as the whole team was focused on day 2 of our kickoff weekend. Here’s what’s going on.\n\nWe’re developing our plan to use the KB-24 for testing shooter angle of exit. We aren’t interested in angles steeper than the 55.84° it comes at, or angles shallower than 15-20° given crucial field dimensions. Our plan to do this at the moment is to make use of our extra chassis width and insert a vertical 1x1” box tubing rail with attachment points for the diagonal box tubing (KB-24003) for each angle we want to test. image 850×738 91.8 KB\n\nimage 850×738 91.8 KB\n\nimage 850×738 91.8 KB\n\nWorking out the geometry for this hole placement will be a little annoying so we’re choosing to do it together, in-person rather than online tonight when everyone’s tired after our 15 hours of meeting time over the last 2 days.\n\nOur different chassis configuration from the recommended long AM14U5 means we’ll be drilling our own mounting holes. You win some, you lose some. We’ll just drill them on the fly and add a second hole attaching KB-24001, the vertical box tubing, to the chassis while we’re at it. Looking at this single point of attachment freaks me out. image 666×586 58.5 KB\n\nimage 666×586 58.5 KB\n\nimage 666×586 58.5 KB\n\nWe have 5.25” of space on our KB not being used by the main superstructure. We’d like to look into using this area to test climbers or any other mechanisms for our main robot during the prototyping period, but we won’t be touching it for now.\n\nTomorrow’s meeting is short and we’ll use it to get the KB team all on the same page, and then probably work out the placement of those new holes in KB-24003 and our new vertical box tubing. We’d like to get all our box tubing cut to length in that time, but we probably won’t be drilling any holes.\n\nThe cutlist from the last post is a constantly-updated (and now pinned in our KB channel) Slack message. Here’s what it looks like now. We noticed that even though FIRST doesn’t provide a manufacturing drawing for KB-24011, we do need to make it, so it’s been added.\n\nkb-24001: vertical box tubing - needs to be changed to 2x1 for our chassis kb-24002: horizontal box tubing at the bottom of the shooter, need made as is kb-24003: diagonal box tubing - needs extra holes for adjustable angles kb-24004: looks like a standard t-gusset im sure we have some kb-24005: came in kop kb-24006: came in kop kb-24007: came in kop kb-24008: 1/8\"-ish (0.12\") polycarb need to cut and drill kb-24009: horizontal box tubing at the top of the shooter, need that kb-24010: flat plate need it kb-24011: other flat plate, no drawing provided by first, need drawing + need it made custom angle adjustment box tubing needs designing + drawing + made\n\nCheckmarked parts are good to go, question-marked parts are probably good to go, exclamation point parts need to be brought into the world, and boom parts need to be altered or made in CAD before progressing.",

Everything is almost ready to come together in a (very long) Friday meeting!\n\nWe’re making our custom angle adjustment plate out of 8020 and KB-24003 out of MAXTube so we don’t have to calculate hole placement and can just set it wherever we like.\n\nHere’s the parts list!\n\nkb-24001: vertical box tubing - changed to 2x1 for our chassis kb-24002: horizontal box tubing at the bottom of the shooter kb-24003: diagonal box tubing kb-24004: using versaframe whether we like it or not kb-24005: came in kop kb-24006: came in kop kb-24007: came in kop kb-24008: 1/8\"-ish (0.12\") polycarb need to cut and drill kb-24009: horizontal box tubing at the top of the shooter kb-24010: flat plate kb-24011: other flat plate custom angle adjustment 8020\n\nDespite appearances, the T-Shaped KB-24004 gusset is not the same as the VersaFrame T-Gusset. We’re pushing forward with what we have (and what we have is a very large pile of old VersaFrame gussets), especially given the more forgiving hole pattern we’re working with to attach to the MAXTube.\n\nIf you’re reading this with the intent to build your own KB, I really recommend using MAXTube or other box tubing with a pre-drilled hole pattern, and then cutting it such that the pre-drilled holes are all in 1/2\" increments from one edge. That is; waste some material trimming the ends of KB-24001, -003, and 009 so that each end of your box tubing is dead in the center of a pre-made hole. Every hole you’re instructed to make on these three parts will line up with a hole in your box tubing that already exists, and your life will be better. KB-24002 will require measuring out some holes no matter where you cut it.",

We ultimately decided not to compensate for it and shorten the distance between the two kb-24003 parts. We tried to keep the same compression by moving kb-24009 with kb-24010 over by .5 inches.\n\nWhen we tried testing it during the last hour of the meeting, we found that it wasn’t able to shoot. The bottom motor was unable to run and push the note out when the note was in the shooter. On Tuesday we will be recreating the issue and trying to fix it.",

I ask because we finished ours, and used a NEO for the upper wheel and it seems to be lacking power. We’ll test it more, but just wondered if you noticed any difference from the kitbot videos.\n\nThanks!",

This means ours is a consistency issue and not a NEO issue.\n\nI wasn’t there (college student mentor problems) but reports from the team and evidence from the video say that shots were more accurate when the shooter wheel was allowed to slow itself down to a full stop before being brought back up to speed.\n\nOne thing we’re adding soon to improve consistency is waiting to run the lower feeder wheel until the upper shooter wheel is up to speed, rather than running it whenever we feel like it. For now, we think that’s the answer, but we’ll test it Friday and see.",

We’ve kinda hit a wall at the moment though as the focus shifts to our season bot\n\nWe’ve been fixing our electronics ( CAN crimping issues) and testing the shooter some more.\n\nThis past Monday, we found that we were stalling the bottom motor, so it was unable to shoot. By pulling the note out a little and then pushing it back in, we were able to run the shooter again. Furthermore, we noticed that we had to show down the wheels before running them again to make our shots accurate.\n\nNow, we’ve changed the code to when we aren’t intaking a note, we’re running the shooter immediately. It helps with getting the shooter up to speed quicker, allowing you to score notes faster.\n\nUnfortunately we don’t have more videos other than Pev’s video above\n\nOur future plans are still to continue testing different shots with the robot and finish mounting a camera on it for scoring and testing purposes. Currently, a camera mount sits on a 2x1 versaframe on top of our front rail. We are potentially considering adding an amp scorer to it as well (Probably the everybot amp scorer)! However, although our focus will be shifting more towards our season robot as the build season continues, (we will not be competing with this robot during the season) it was a great opportunity for our newbies to participate in!",
