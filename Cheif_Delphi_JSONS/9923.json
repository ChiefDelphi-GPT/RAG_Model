We are using a USB2CAN adapter by inno-maker to accomplish this.\n\nSeveral posts here on CD, make us believe that we should be able to install RobotPy on our Raspberry Pi and then use Python commands on our Raspberry Pi to control our Talon SRX.\n\nWe followed this documentation here: Computer Installation — RobotPy 2023 documentation for the Linux ARM Coprocessor. The command listed below, completed without errors.\n\nWe then followed this documentation here: RobotPy Components — RobotPy 2023 documentation\n\nWhich we believe indicated that we needed to install the CTRE package. As you can see from the terminal output included here that did not go so well.\n\nIs anyone able to confirm this is the best path to accomplish our goal of being able to use Python to control our CTRE Talon SRX via CAN bus from our Raspberry PI?\n\nIf by some chance the path we went down is the recommended path, can anyone provide assistance in resolving this error? Looks like the package may be out of date or looking for a file that is not where it is expected.\n\nThank you for any assistance you are able to provide.",

This may be related to not being able to find the correct version of CTRE or install it correctly.\n\nAccording to the docs that syntax you used is correct for picking components so it’s pointing to the right place it seems.\n\nOutside of that I haven’t used RobotPy but I have done Linux socketCAN for controlling the TalonSRX on a Jetson nano. In that scenario I wasn’t using the wpi code at all. It was just the Phoenix libraries in CPP for a non frc project.\n\nAre you trying to do something that requires FRC driver station and other wpi code or just simply drive a talonSrx from a non RoboRio Linux board?\n\nIf you are okay with CPP and can get ahold of a canable or other device for Can to USB (a Canivore will not work. TalonSRX is 2.0 and Canivore is FD). Prepare Linux Robot Controller — Phoenix documentation is the guide I started from.\n\nCTRE currently recommends the CANable for use as a generic CAN 2.0 SocketCAN device. More information can be found here: https://canable.io/\n\nOther potential issues\n\nRaspberry Pi/Jetson Nano Image your device with the respective image below. Other Images can also be used, although these images have been tested and are known to be supported.\n\nRaspbian Buster is what they have tested with for PI. On Jetson nano I was using the default jetpack image they link to but eventually found how to get Ubuntu 20.04. as they note other versions may work. Just no promises.\n\nAlternatively you can deploy SocketCAN firmware to a HERO. See our repository on Github.\n\nThe canable can end up out of stock quite often. If you can get ahold of a hero board that would work as well. They have custom firmware for the hero that will make it capable of socketCAN.\n\nEdit: also I found this nifty PDF awhile ago. I’m sure the original authors might have some insights about this as well.\n\n*Cough @marshall *\n\nJetson Nano, TileRunner, Talon SRX, and ROS Tutorial.pdf (83.2 MB)\n\nBtw awesome documentation!",

                    "cooked": "For the bad news: even if you could get it to build, it is likely the thing you’re trying to do will not work with our distributed builds as-is. My understanding is that CTRE has two different versions of their library, one that is for simulation and one that is for hardware control. robotpy’s CTRE package only include the simulation version, and the build configuration is only set up for that.\n\nIt is possible that you could adjust the configuration of our build and use the non-simulation version as a custom build by modifying pyproject.toml. We did discuss some of this at Allow this to be used standalone on an RPi · Issue #106 · robotpy/robotpy-ctre · GitHub , but at the end of the day nobody who cares about this has put in the work to make it happen.\n\nAnother wrinkle is that I believe CTRE never published the ARM libraries in vendor library form, which probably in part explains the 404 error. I think maybe they published an ARM apt package that likely has the libraries in it? You might be able to get the correct libraries and headers, put them in the right zip file, then modify pyproject.toml (see setup.py and pyproject.toml — robotpy-build 0.0.0 documentation ), and build it… it would be challenging but if you have deep C++ experience it could be doable. (Edit: thinking about it some more, we could change robotpy-build to be able to link against system-installed libraries and that might be enough to make it work, but you’d still need C++ experience to pull off your side of this if you wanted to try that).\n\nCTRE is releasing a new python package this year called ‘phoenix6’ which has support for switching between library versions at runtime, but uses the phoenix v6 API which may not support all of their hardware. See their documentation for details.",

Again that PDF I shared before is specifically about ROS, TalonSRX and Linux which is what you are after. The link above is about Ros with Arduino but the topics can carry over and apply to controlling FRC components as well on rpi.\n\nAlso I liked https://www.theconstructsim.com/ when I was starting out. They have some free basic python for robotics and basics of ROS courses. There is paid stuff for advanced learning but if you did the basics of ROS and python you might be well on your way to just control a TalonSRX",
