Recently, we participated in the North Star Regional with our robot, which featured a tank drive and shallow climb capabilities. Our robot performed well, functioning reliably and allowing us to address and fix any issues quickly. We adjusted our autonomous programming and improved our shallow climb performance. Although we didn’t align with an alliance, we had a great experience and learned a lot. Last year, our robot underperformed significantly, failing to move effectively on the field or defend, so this was a significant improvement.\n\nOur team has discussed exploring alternative drive systems, such as swerve, but our coach suggested starting with Mecanum as a stepping stone. He believes Mecanum offers better maneuverability and would help us adapt to the field better, especially when aligning with stations or reversing. While I’m concerned about the limited off-season time available, I believe attempting Mecanum could enhance our robot's performance before potentially transitioning to swerve in the future, which I genuinely admire for its advanced features.\n\nSwitching to Mecanum might resolve our navigation challenges, which were often complicated with our current system. However, I’m curious if this switch would complicate tasks like alignment and backing up. In the long term, I’d love to fully adopt swerve for its superior handling, but for now, I’m open to Mecanum as an intermediate solution to build foundational skills.\n\nFeedback from you all would be invaluable as we plan our approach. How does switching to Mecanum sound, and do you see benefits over our current setup? Let me know your thoughts—I’m eager to hear how we can improve our robot’s mobility for future competitions.",

Mecanum will be 'easier' to install on a kit chassis, even with the extra gearboxes required; however, swerve is rapidly becoming easier to do given the right parts. Either way, mecanum requires a completely different mechanical and programming setup than swerve does. As a matter of practicality, mecanum that isn't driven like a swerve should really be a tank drive, and mecanum that is driven like a swerve is going to be completely outclassed by every swerve on the field.\"\n\nWhat I would NOT tell him is: \"Some teams see mecanum and instantly remove that team from any pick lists.\" Even though it’s true, it’s still not something that I think needs to be said.\n\nOne other thing: An anonymous poster mentioned that \"OC Regional has 1 tank and 1 mecanum. Everything else swerves, including the rookie.\" That's interesting because the data shows that swerve is currently the dominant drive style. Rookie teams are pulling off swerve drives, and you might want to check out the linked thread for more details.\n\nI’m going to emphasize this: Rookie teams are successfully implementing swerve drives. The data indicates that swerve is currently the most popular choice among teams. Regarding your question about switching to mecanum, I would not recommend it. It’s actually a downgrade compared to what you already have. If I were you, I’d stick with your current setup and aim to get the best swerve system available before the offseason competition begins.",

We also switched from white wheels to black ones for improved traction.\n\nAt the end of the school year last year, we transitioned to swerve. Over the past few years, we had been gradually building the swerve system, purchasing components as our budget allowed. This year, we finally used swerve for the first time.\n\nThere is a knowledge gap we needed to address, and we are still learning.\n\nIn summary: If you desire a Corvette, never settle for a Chevette. There are numerous swerve options available, and coding isn’t overly challenging. Additionally, there is ample support available if you encounter any issues.\n\nI would encourage anyone considering the leap into swerve.

Mecanum can serve as a fun academic exercise when exploring drivetrain history, especially when there's nothing else to do. However, it's not practical for competitive use today. Focusing on mechanical systems during the off-season can be a good idea. While the fundamentals are straightforward, there's still much to learn regarding tuning, driver practice, precise autocross navigation, and maintenance—details you probably don't want to handle during competition season. After four years of experience, we've found that there are always new things to uncover. Mecanum won't magically improve your performance overnight.",

If your driver can achieve peak efficiency with your current drivetrain, you will perform well. Additionally, consider enhancing software to support your driver. Each Venom has internal encoders; utilizing them can improve automation or driver aids. Mechanum vehicles lose efficiency and speed when moving in non-perpendicular directions, often forcing drivers to operate like a tank due to inefficiencies or drivetrain misalignment, which may also lead to overheating. This reduces both speed and acceleration in such movements. Moreover, wheel odometry becomes unreliable under these conditions, necessitating dead wheels. Mechanum vehicles are highly sensitive to mass distribution, further complicating their operation.",

I’ve been involved in the design of numerous FIRST Robotics Competition robots and have helped start several FIRST Robotics Competition teams since 1996, with over 40 years of motor engineering experience. Your team performed well with the basic L1 design this year. Additional pushing power could have provided a slight advantage, while a mecanum drive would have been a significant disadvantage.\n\nFIRST Tech Challenge is a great program, and mecanum drive works well there. In Michigan, FTC is limited to middle school teams, and many of our top FIRST Robotics Competition students began their journey in FTC. However, none of those students would recommend mecanum drive for an FRC robot.",

I’m not convinced it was ever worth the headache. If your center of gravity isn’t perfectly centered over the middle of the robot, you will never, ever drive straight unless you do weird stuff in your code to compensate. This makes programming a competent Mecanum drive far more difficult than it looks on the surface.\n\nI spent 2 years mentoring 3007, a team from your neck of the woods who insisted on Mecanum year after year. We had mentors who were well-versed in wrangling Mecanum’s quirks in code. We had good habits around checking rollers for debris between matches. WE STILL NEVER DROVE STRAIGHT.\n\nBack then, there was (sort of) a case for Mecanum. Yes, it was fiddly, you never drove straight, and you always moved slower than everyone else, but you couldn’t get t-boned and tight field geometry wasn’t a hindrance. Now, Swerve delivers on all of Mecanum’s advantages, does a better job at those advantages than Mecanum can, and has none of the fiddly in-competition annoyances.\n\nThe only game I can think of where Mecanum could have had a net advantage over tank was 2015—a game unlike any other in the RIO era, and Mecanum STILL didn’t work great because the weight of the totes threw your CoG totally out of whack while you placed a stack. You either couldn’t drive straight while going to the feeder, or you couldn’t drive straight while placing a stack. Pick your poison.",

Team 6167 used an Everybot mecanum robot to perform captain roles at their last two FSC events, though there are some considerations:  \nThey were also able to avoid interference and operate the processor algae, which added additional value. Having the Everybot climb was particularly advantageous in FSC compared to other events, as several top teams chose not to include climbing. This year’s game was relatively more mecanum-friendly due to shorter sprints, which mitigated the loss of power compared to games like Crescendo or Charged Up. This wasn’t their first time competing with a mecanum.  \n\nAdditionally, while I criticize the swerve tax and how the mere presence of a swerve affects many teams' build strategies, mecanum continues to improve in 2025. Unless there’s a significant rule change for 2026, there are two viable options in my view:  \nUsing the AM14U6 chassis from the kit with HiGrip wheels, paired with your preferred Toughbox Mini gear ratio and drivetrain motor. If you anticipate high wheel wear, consider upgrading to the 8WD kit. Implementing a Commercial, off-the-shelf swerve, when done correctly, offers a higher competitive ceiling. However, if your resources or capacity are limited, the former configuration remains a reasonable alternative.",

                    "cooked": "If your center of gravity isn’t perfectly centered over the middle of the robot, driving straight would require unusual adjustments in the code, making mecánico (mecanum) drives much harder than they seem. Thank you for clarifying why mecánico can be challenging instead of just advising against it. In ideal conditions, mecánico is usually streamlined for quick setup and functionality, leading to a holonomic drive train. For this year’s Kitbot, the center of gravity is relatively stable, potentially making mecánico a viable option. However, you’d still need to use dual gearboxes—one per wheel—adding to costs slightly.\n\nThat said, the most frustrating issue arises when the frame isn’t perfectly aligned. If it tilts slightly, the bot could lose balance on two opposite wheels, affecting movement in both axes. This happened to us in 2015, the first and last time we attempted mecánico. We defaulted to a straightforward tank drive until 2024, often overwhelmed by swerves, and mecánico wasn’t reconsidered seriously afterward.\n\nAn interesting cost-saving tip: only two swerve modules are needed for a swerve bot. Placing them diagonally and using omnidirectional wheels for the remaining corners works flawlessly in our practice bot. While most builder tools expect four modules, you can ignore two and adjust parameters accordingly. Using Yagsl, we’ve successfully operated both our practice and competition bots without code modifications. While this approach works for testing, it’s not recommended for official competitions.",

Actually, mecanum drives rarely drive straight even if the CG is centered and your frame is built to good tolerances unless you solve a rather complicated controls problem. The easiest way to demonstrate it is to drive a mecanum drive bot forwards, then suddenly sideways. Two of the wheels need to swap directions, but because the wheels and robot has inertia and non-zero latency, the robot skews and you aren’t straight anymore. This isn’t unsolvable, but it is outside the means of almost every FIRST Robotics Competition team to solve, hence why most mecanum FIRST Robotics Competition and FIRST Tech Challenge bots don’t drive straight to some degree or another unless driven slowly. It is possible to solve this problem (I’ve personally done so); it’s really hard (you need to use a Cartesian-space inverse dynamics controller, while extrapolating out latency and avoiding voltage, current, and traction saturations). Swerve is less susceptible to these issues due to having more traction and throwing 400W brushless motors at the problem.",

Despite no defense, it was flashy for a team that couldn’t run swerve. I would highly recommend trying out swerve if you can gather the funds. There are many excellent tools available. For coding, there’s YAGSL, yet another generic swerve library, and SDS, Swerve Drive Specialties, which operates quite straightforwardly. Just don’t place magnets upside down. However, it can be costly, and our team is fortunate to have supportive sponsors. I’d suggest looking for a grant specifically for a swerve base. If they recognize the innovation and STEM behind your project, it could help secure the necessary funding.",

If your driver can reach peak efficiency with your current drivetrain, you will do well.  \n\nDrive practice is critically important and swerve gives you two big advantages toward this goal.  \n\n(1) Building a swerve drive base is dead easy. Cut 4 2x1 tubes to the appropriate lengths, bolt on your modules, and cut a quick and dirty belly pan out of 5mm plywood. Attach your electronics. Once you decide on a robot size, you should be able to get started with driving in a day or two.  \n\n(2) Swerve provides \"field-oriented\" (as opposed to \"robot-oriented\") controls, making driving so much easier.  \n\nThis was how we built our \"first\" swerve, which we called \"Barbie Bot.\"",
