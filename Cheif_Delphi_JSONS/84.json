                    "cooked": "Hi all,\n\nI’m interested in hearing some opinions before my team regroups to make a decision. Recently, our robot participated in the North Star Regional competition. It featured a tank drive and could perform a shallow climb. Our robot excelled, functioning effectively during the competition. We faced minimal issues, fixing problems when needed. We made improvements, enhancing our shallow climb capability, and were ready to compete. Unfortunately, we didn’t secure an alliance placement, but we had a great time and learned a lot. Compared to last year, our robot underperformed, struggling to move or defend on the field, making this an upgrade.\n\nFollowing the regional competition, we began discussing drive trains. After reviewing past years, we’ve consistently used tank drive, reverting from Omni due to its unreliability. I proposed trying alternative drive trains like swerve or Mecanum. My coach expressed interest, but prefers starting with Mecanum before moving to swerve. His reasoning is that Mecanum offers incremental benefits, allowing more time to develop swerve skills during the off-season. However, I’m concerned about limited time available over the summer for development.\n\nPersonally, I’d prefer to focus on migrating to swerve to maximize future functionality during competitions. My concern is whether Mecanum, though less complex, would limit our progress towards swerve. During competition, our robot struggled with navigating the field, requiring complex maneuvers. Mecanum improves field navigation but may complicate alignment and return-to-station processes.\n\nSwitching to Mecanum seems beneficial in the short term but risks delaying our long-term goal of adopting swerve. My ultimate aim is to fully leverage swerve’s capabilities for competitive advantage. In the meantime, I hope to strike a balance between improving maneuverability and preparing for a smooth transition to swerve. I’m eager to gather feedback to explore these options effectively.\n\nThank you for your insights!",

Swerve is a completely different drivetrain with a different setup. While Mecanum may seem simpler due to extra gearboxes, swerve is becoming more accessible. Both require distinct mechanical and programming setups. Mecanum must be treated as a tank if not swerved, making swerve-equipped robots far superior.”\n\nWhat I wouldn’t tell him is: “Some teams mistakenly remove Mecanum entirely, even when using swerve. While true, this detail doesn’t warrant a public statement.”\n\nOne key point: In OC Regional, there’s 1 tank, 1 Mecanum, and the rest using swerve, including rookies.  \n\nThis reflects the growing trend, supported by a source discussing Swerve dominance in 2025.  \n\nStarManTheGamer asks if switching to Mecanum would improve things. My answer: “Switching to Swerve would be a clear upgrade, especially if you aim for the cheapest available option.”\n\nAvoid downgrades; stick to maximizing Swerve performance before the offseason.\n\n--- \n\nThis version removes unnecessary HTML elements, ensures consistency in quotation marks, and maintains the original message succinctly.",

This year marked our inaugural year utilizing the swerve system. Despite filling a knowledge gap, we remain dedicated to continuous learning. For those considering an upgrade, especially from budget-friendly models to higher performance vehicles, we offer this advice: opt for a Corvette over a Chevette. The swerve system presents numerous options, though basic coding remains approachable with adequate support. We strongly recommend embarking on this journey if you haven't already.",

Mecanum can serve as an engaging academic exercise when delving into the history of drivetrains, especially if you have free time. However, it’s not suitable for competitive purposes today. Focus on an off-season swerve drive. While the fundamentals are straightforward, learning to tune, practice driving, accurately follow vehicle paths, and maintain your setup becomes crucial during the season—something you may prefer to skip. Over the past four years, we’ve continued to discover new aspects of swerving. Mecanum won’t guide you toward achieving those insights efficiently.",

If your driver can reach peak efficiency with your current drivetrain, you will do well. Also look into improving software to help your driver. Each of your Venoms has internal encoders, so try using them to improve autos, or make driver aids.\n\n---\n\nEricH mentions that a mecanum drive which isn't driven like a swerve should really be a tank drive. He adds that sometimes teams adjust the drivetrain to mimic a tank drive due to inefficiency or heat issues during strafing. This causes reduced speed and acceleration in those directions. Additionally, mechanum drives are sensitive to uneven mass distribution, affecting their performance.\n\nLet me know if you'd like further adjustments!",

Your team performed well with the basic L1 design this year. Adding more pushing power would give a slight edge, but mecanum drive would negatively impact performance.\n\nFTC is an excellent program, and mecanum drive performs well there. However, in Michigan, FTC is limited to middle school teams, while many of our top FRC students come from FTC backgrounds. Those students wouldn’t recommend mecanum for an FRC robot.",

I'm not convinced it was ever worth the headache. If your center of gravity isn't perfectly centered over the middle of the robot, you'll never, ever drive straight unless you do weird stuff in your code to compensate. This makes programming a competent Mecanum drive far more difficult than it looks on the surface. I spent 2 years mentoring 3007, a team from your neck of the woods who insisted on Mecanum year after year. We had mentors who were well-versed in wrangling Mecanum's quirks in code. We had good habits around checking rollers for debris between matches. We still never drove straight. Back then, there was (sort of) a case for Mecanum. Yes, it was fiddly, you never drove straight, and you always moved slower than everyone else, but you couldn't get t-boned and tight field geometry wasn't a hindrance. Nowadays, Swerve delivers on all of Mecanum's advantages, does a better job at those advantages than Mecanum can, and has none of the fiddly in-competition annoyances. The only game I can think of where Mecanum could have had a net advantage over tank was 2015—a game unlike any other in the RIO era, and Mecanum still didn't work great because the weight of the totes threw your CoG totally out of whack while you placed a stack. You either couldn't drive straight while going to the feeder, or you couldn't drive straight while placing a stack. Pick your poison.",

While the team with number 6167 achieved success with an Everybot, there are considerations to keep in mind. One advantage of using an Everybot is its ability to stay out of the way and utilize processor algae, which adds value. Another benefit is the increased utility of climbing during competitions, as fewer top teams omit this feature. This year’s competition was more favorable to Mecanum robots due to shorter sprints and reduced power loss compared to other districts. Additionally, this wasn’t their first experience with Mecanum robots.\n\nFSC may not be the strongest district, but our top robots include number #138 and #253 in EPA (Expected Points Added), along with #598, #728, and #1766 in Houston.\n\nAs for Mecanum robots, much debate surrounds the swerve tax, which impacts many teams’ equipment choices. However, Mecanum appears to be moving backward in 2025. Without significant rule changes in 2026, there are two viable solutions:\n\n1. Use the AM14U6 chassis with HiGrip wheels, your preferred Toughbox Mini ratio, and a drivetrain motor. Consider adding an 8WD upgrade kit if wheel usage is expected to be high.\n2. Opt for COTS (commercial, off-the-shelf) swerve systems, which offer a higher competitive edge.\n\nWhile the second option provides better performance, if resources limit your ability to implement swerve, the first option remains a reasonable choice.",

                    "cooked": "If your center of gravity isn’t perfectly centered over the middle of the robot, you will never, ever drive straight unless you do weird stuff in your code to compensate. Actually even more generally, mecanum drives rarely drive straight even if the CG is centered and your frame is built to good tolerances unless you solve a rather complicated controls problem. The easiest way to demonstrate it is to drive a mecanum drive bot forwards, then suddenly sideways. Two of the wheels need to swap directions, but because the wheels and robot has inertia and non-zero latency, the robot skews and you aren’t straight anymore. This isn’t unsolvable, but it’s outside the means of almost every FRC team to solve, hence why most mecanum FRC and FTC bots don’t drive straight to some degree or another unless driven slowly.  \n\nIt is possible to solve this problem (I’ve personally done so), its really hard (you need to use a cartesian-space inverse dynamics controller, while extrapolating out latency and avoiding voltage, current, and traction saturations), while swerve is just less susceptible to these issues due to having more traction and throwing 400W brushless motors at the problem.",

While it wasn’t a defense, it was notable for a team unable to deploy swerve wheels.\n\nI strongly suggest attempting swerve wheels if your team can secure the funding. There are many excellent tools available. In terms of coding, YAGSL is a useful abbreviation. There are also extensive resources on widening mechanisms, and SDS Swerve Drive Specialties operates smoothly. (Avoid placing magnets upside down.)\n\nIt’s important to note that this technology is costly, and our team benefits from generous赞助. I recommend seeking a grant from a sponsor specifically for a swerve base project. If the innovation and STEM aspects align with their support, they may provide the necessary funding.",

Additionally, swerve offers two critical advantages toward this objective:\n\n1. Building a swerve base is straightforward. Cut four 2x1 tubes to the required lengths, attach your modules, and construct a basic belly pan from 5mm plywood. Once your robot size is determined, practicing drives becomes achievable in a day or two.\n\n2. Swerve provides \"field-oriented\" control, making driving considerably easier compared to \"robot-oriented\" systems.\n\nThis was our initial swerve project (\"Barbie Bot\"). Below are images documenting our build process.\n\n![Barbie Bot](https:// chiefdelphi.com/uploads/default/original/4X/c/b/3/cb37712bc6b11be219dc824098cba10491466606.jpeg)\n![Swerve Build Progress](https:// chiefdelphi.com/uploads/default/original/4X/1/7/7/17784f094a79d455135a25b9d77c04004e1c408a.jpeg)\n\nOldtimers may recall our 2012 home-bUILT swerve project.",
