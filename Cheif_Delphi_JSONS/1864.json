Our team is a part of the Queen City Robotics Alliance (QCRA), a non-profit organization we helped found, that supports Charlotte area FIRST teams.\n\nCurrently we are in our off-season after a successful 2025 season where we won the FIRST Impact Award at UNC Asheville and the North Carolina District Championship, along with the Team Sustainability Awards in our division at the FIRST World Championship.\n\nSo far we’ve tried to eliminate our use of an OrangePi for vision processing by running Photon Vision on Systemcore, but based on another team’s testing where one camera with a 2D AprilTag pipeline made the CPU usage jump from 25-30% to 65-70%. We decided that our 2 cameras that use 3D pipelines would be smoother on our OrangePi and keep the CPU usage on the main robot controller low.\n\nJust sharing my experience getting PhotonVision running on SystemCore. Installation is very simple, just copy the PhotonVision JAR onto the device and create a systemd service to run it as root. Wi...\n\nMore on our SystemCore adventures, we’re planning on testing the necessity of a CANivore. Our team has all the motors and sensors that are a part of our drivetrain on a separate CANbus added by the CANivore to improve speed and control when driving, as well as to protect the drivetrain in case any devices on the main CANbus break. We’d like to test whether or not using a CANivore or 2 CANchains on SystemCore works better. A major problem we faced this season with the roboRIO was CPU usage issues due to vision processing. The SystemCore is much more powerful compared to the roboRIO and we are testing if those issues will be solved with the new robot controller.\n\nA lot of our work with SystemCore as of now is preparing for it to be used on our competition robot for offseason events. As a team, we are focusing on training rookies and undergoing a strategic redesign of our REEFSCAPE robot, Beluga, that incorporates SystemCore and is more competitive for said events.\n\nKeep in mind we won’t have regular updates due to SystemCore not being on the robot yet!\n\nIn addition to the electrical changes brought about by SystemCore, we plan to re-wire a lot of the robot for cleaner wire management and as practice for new members of the team. We’ve designed a new end effector for our offseason competitions after many strategic redesign workshops. This end effector is meant to give us both coral and algae capabilities using super-pinch, something we weren’t able to fully utilize during the actual season. We are trying it with a 20:1 gear ratio on the intake rollers for torque to pinch algae.\n\nIntaking ALGAE 1065×855 145 KB Intaking CORAL 749×654 93.3 KB\n\nIntaking ALGAE 1065×855 145 KB\n\nIntaking ALGAE 1065×855 145 KB\n\nIntaking CORAL 749×654 93.3 KB\n\nIntaking CORAL 749×654 93.3 KB\n\nOn the programming side of our team, we are rewriting our auto-align code, which is crucial for fast cycles in this game, and creating a simulation sandbox for future robot projects. Simulation is a tool we heavily utilized this season, for anything from camera placements to logic for our game piece manipulator system. We were able to simulate camera feeds using PhotonVision and AdvantageScope’s 3D Field, which greatly sped up our programming process. With a custom 3D model of our robot, we were able to quickly test logic code despite its four degrees of freedom.\n\nOur first offseason event is SCRAP, in Camden, South Carolina on August 23rd. Stay tuned for more updates and please ask questions below!",

However, once we made the switch from our RoboRIO 2.0 to SystemCore, we found there was no change in signal when connected to the new robot controller.\n\nMagSwitch setup 1346×1007 189 KB\n\nMagSwitch setup 1346×1007 189 KB\n\nMagSwitch setup 1346×1007 189 KB\n\nWe proceeded to test multiple ports, verified the magnet being detected by the switch, verified the signal wire changes voltage with the magnet (3.3V which is within the range on the spec sheet ), and also that the switch works on the RIO with a test board.\n\nBelow is the panel showing red and “X” when we tested out the IO by putting in bare wire, shorting the power and ground pins of a port. We fixed this fault with a power cycle. Normally, the red light is off. It only turns on when there is some kind of fault. It’s pretty cool being able to see exactly which port is faulting!\n\nRed IO light :c 1920×2560 400 KB\n\nRed IO light :c 1920×2560 400 KB\n\nRed IO light :c 1920×2560 400 KB\n\nThe internal resistor inside SystemCore is a 4.7kΩ pull down resistor compared to a 40kΩ pull up resistor on the RIO. After opening an issue on Github, Thad House confirmed our suspicions that the lack of value changing was very likely due to the pull down resistor. He speculated the sensor was built with a pull up in the signal path, and used an NPN style transistor setup. This problem could be fixed by adding a resistor to the circuit, but we did not have one on hand. This suggests that many of our common powered sensors we have now may not work with the internal pull down resistor.\n\nREV Magnetic Limit Switch not being read on SystemCore Smart I/O ports opened 10:56PM - 16 Aug 25 UTC taran-duba\n\nREV Magnetic Limit Switch not being read on SystemCore Smart I/O ports opened 10:56PM - 16 Aug 25 UTC taran-duba\n\nopened 10:56PM - 16 Aug 25 UTC taran-duba\n\nopened 10:56PM - 16 Aug 25 UTC\n\ntaran-duba\n\nHi all,\n\nWe are running a Rev Magnetic limit switch on our robot with SystemCore … and are having an issue with the boolean reading not changing.

The next hardware version of SystemCore will have a different internal resistor, which may make it more compatible with more existing sensors.\n\nIt looks like the digital IOs are configured to pull down, as opposed to the pull-ups on the RIO. Is this subject to change in future iterations of the hardware?

I2C devices are also mentioned in a discussion about SPI functionality. These were just on the SystemCore Github, not sure if it’s what you’re looking for.\n\nIt looks like the digital IOs are configured to pull down, as opposed to the pull-ups on the RIO. Is this subject to change in future iterations of the hardware? Keeping interoperability with the R...\n\nI didn't quickly find an answer in the 2027 javadocs so poking here: Do SmartIO or the I2C outputs also support SPI functionality? It's pretty darn low priority for me, and I'd be OK if it didn't e...",

The FMS had connected fine in our subsequent matches although there was a network handshake issue at the start of one which didn’t seem to be due to SystemCore.\n\nWhat fixed the issue was unplugging the ethernet cable from SystemCore and plugging it back in. SCRAP’s FTAs suspected it was simply a network handshake issue that could normally be seen on RIOs and would usually be fixed with the reset button. We know many teams have brought up the lack of a physical reset button as a concern, this FTA had looked for that button when troubleshooting and requested it be brought back on future versions.\n\nSCRAP Pit 782×1163 130 KB\n\nSCRAP Pit 782×1163 130 KB\n\nSCRAP Pit 782×1163 130 KB",

Limelight or other Protonvision did not officially posted about supporting systemcore yet so I was just thinking about using Ni RoboRio 2 instead of systemCore until they have documentation on it.",
