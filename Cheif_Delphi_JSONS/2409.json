                    "cooked": "Hey Takumi, I’m the one behind the climb. I’m happy to walk you through the development process!\n\nTo give you some background, we’ve historically been a low-resource, relatively inexperienced team. We were ranked 85th/104 in the Chesapeake district last year, and due to how our club used to be managed, we had very few people who truly knew what was going on despite having a large team, and that influenced our design choices.\n\nOur robot was designed top-down to get the most strategic value out of the least amount of robot. For example, we chose to be a L2/L3 specialist, as L4 is worth only one more point but would require another foot and a half of vertical extension, which itself requires figuring out elevator rigging and adding a second stage all while taking more time to extend and creating a more wobbly coral placer + more tippy robot. Similarly, since algae isn’t directly tied to any ranking points, we decided to only remove it from the reef. What’s most notable is that room for expansion of our functionality was built in from the start - our coral placing mechanism is offset from the start to be in the exact same location as if it were attached to a second elevator stage, and of course a massive hole in the bellypan for our deep climb was also there from the very start.\n\nWhen it came to architecting the robot, I probably spent two or two and a half weeks on it before we decided on the final direction. Part of that was the fact that our first week of the build season was snowed in, but part of it was that it let me pay attention to every little detail. One of those was our approach to the deep climb - our first ideas were to pivot it into the robot through various means, but they were all dependent on having another independent mechanism, something I wanted to avoid. Another idea we had was to drive into the deep cage until it swung inside our bumpers, and that would enable us to push it straight down/pull ourselves straight up using an elevator (which would already be on the robot) to get the climb.\n\nimage 988×891 59.2 KB Once you have an idea like that, it’s just a matter of figuring out if the geometry works. In this case, it did, so I went with it.\n\nimage 988×891 59.2 KB\n\nimage 988×891 59.2 KB\n\nimage 841×892 70.1 KB This was the next approach for the climb. It’s mocked up in the KrayonCAD of the robot - after designing an “archetype” in a sketch, I used the library to quickly translate it into something 3D. This approach to the climb would have pulled the robot straight up, but my teammates had concerns about the archetype as a whole, particularly the width of the elevator and the two degrees of freedom (historically, we’re barely been able to pull of one), so I pivoted to integrating the climb with another archetype.\n\nimage 841×892 70.1 KB\n\nimage 841×892 70.1 KB\n\nimage 924×848 69.7 KB The next archetype was a single degree of freedom approach. Due to the location of the coral placer (and the fact that I wanted it to be in the right-pole scoring position when the robot was centered on the face of the reef), there was no longer space for the deep climb to be on the front of the robot, so I moved it to the side of the elevator. Of course, being so far to the side of the robot, there is no hope of balancing the center of mass to be directly underneath the climb, so I took another look at the geometry:\n\nimage 924×848 69.7 KB\n\nimage 924×848 69.7 KB\n\nimage 1177×716 63.8 KB With the deep climb positioned to the side of the robot, you have to pull up a significant amount, and the robot tilts over, but actually holds a surprise advantage: the location of the center of mass basically doesn’t matter anymore, as the robot will always tilt over 90 degrees, and you can pretty easily change how much the cage is pushed down. Just to verify, I made the center of mass and climb distance adjustable by variables so that all sorts of scenarios could be tested. Another example of that: image 1442×826 151 KB\n\nimage 1177×716 63.8 KB\n\nimage 1177×716 63.8 KB\n\nimage 1442×826 151 KB\n\nimage 1442×826 151 KB\n\nSo, yeah, the whole robot was design around the wacky climb from the second week of the build season.\n\nSince the design was originally meant to be an elevator-based deep climb, this was our first approach to actually grabbing the cage: image 1058×638 70.7 KB Prototyping had shown that adding more grippy wheels significantly improved grip when pulling the robot up (it increased friction by increasing force, as each additional wheel pushes harder against the cage). Ultimately we chose not to do this approach for our Week 3 competition as:\n\nimage 1058×638 70.7 KB\n\nimage 1058×638 70.7 KB\n\nWe were just coming from a week 2 competition\n\nWe saw 1684’s brilliant approach to a bellypan deep climb\n\n…the pressfit pinions on our elevator gearbox motors died halfway through the week and we didn’t have a working elevator until the afternoon we loaded into our week 3 competition\n\nWe then prototyped the bellypan deep climb for district champs on our kitbot:\n\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/354409233552244738/1359594403844587552/PXL_20250321_215058510.TS.mp4?ex=6817b075&is=68165ef5&hm=8445476c04a5263a1fc570bbfe251e57df80b877cbdc01aaa607582df82f1b5e&\n\nUnfortunately, a bug wiped out quite literally our entire team for a week and a half, so it wasn’t working in time for DCMP , but the core of it was there.\n\nFollowing DCMP , the climb became our full focus (we weren’t getting picked without it, but also we probably weren’t getting picked either way, mainly we just wanted to see it work). The majority of the work was in bracing the gearboxes to avoid their mount from bending and causing the chain to skip as well as in spacing the cage within the robot to keep it on the wheels and prevent it from getting caught on anything. We worked on it all week, all weekend, and for a good amount of worlds (we climbed in our practice match but it wasn’t quite legal), and after a successful session on the playground practice field, we rolled it out for our final match of the season .\n\nPXL_20250418_212349553 1376×1034 378 KB\n\nPXL_20250418_212349553 1376×1034 378 KB\n\nPXL_20250418_212349553 1376×1034 378 KB\n\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/812515496816672809/1363650738475241552/HolyGuacamole.mp4?ex=681748f7&is=6815f777&hm=82b11c57ee6104c6c08f8d51de91030ede37a859b95f159041c5e0391516fa7e&\n\nOf course I could not be prouder; we had one of the most unique climbs in the world, not something I would have expected to say before the season’s start. As cool as it is, though, I must admit that the nature of our climb was somewhat of an impedance on our ability to be competitive. It made the robot very tippy towards the elevator side, the initial focus on an elevator climb made the elevator much slower than otherwise could have been due to the large reduction in its gearing, and its novelty led to the mechanism having a much greater development time than a simpler/more proven deep climb (such as that of the everybot) would have been. Had we chosen something more similar to the everybot approach, we could have finalized the archetype earlier, centered the elevator + scoring mechanism and had a much less tippy robot that I could drive more agressively, and had a working deep climb in time for our first or second competition which would have easily propelled us to a top 3 alliance captain at both of our district qualifiers. As much as I would love for you to take away the nature of the design process, I would also like for you to take away my message of caution, and to ensure that when you design your next robot, the entire team is onboard with the goals of the season. I designed this type of climb because I wanted to do something unique instead of using someone else’s design, but if more of the team had input on more aspects of the initial design process, we likely would have taken the approach more suited to our team’s capabilities and been more competitive as a result.",
