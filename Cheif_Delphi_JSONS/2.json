                    "cooked": "Dear CD ,\n\nLooking for some technical advice from people who might have a better idea than I.\n\nWe had a failure on our CANbus this past weekend, where we broke a wire in our “energy chain” going up to the elevator. It was probably due to pinching or maybe too much bending. The wire was simple twisted pair (2 separate wires). We are looking to get some jacketed cable to replace it, possibly chainflex from Igus.\n\nThe best looking wire comes as 4 conductor cable. For CAN , we only need 2 wires (we terminate up on the elevator), so that raises my question: would it be better to crimp the wires in pairs (2 wires in parallel), or stick with 1 wires each, and have the 2nd set as a backup?\n\nA couple of things I have thought of:\n\nif they are crimped as 2 pairs of 2 wires, it would be “instantly” redundant (assuming only 1 wire breaks). This could save a match.\n\nOTOH, a broken wire in a crimp pair will still cause signal reflections, and maybe that will cause hard-to-diagnose issues on the CAN bus.\n\nI don’t know how sensitive CAN is to these issues, esp on FRC robots with only a few devices and moderately short runs.\n\nAnyone have a good feel for this?",

(My suspicion is that it will work just fine at 1 Mbps CAN , but testing beats guessing.)",

Although its smaller so it handles it longer than larger gauges.\n\n@prensing where exactly in the chain did the wire break? Could it have had tension on it when things move? What wire gauge is it? If it was fairly small work hardening takes longer to be problematic like @sokoloff elludes too, needing many many cycles to cause a wire failure due to work-hardening alone.",
