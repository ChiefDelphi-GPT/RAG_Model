I figured I could start learning GD&T to use it on my technical drawings and it seems pretty complex and difficult to understand. We also do not have access to CNC machining that does not require technical drawings.\n\nBasically: Do other teams use GD&T? Should I start using GD&T? If so, how can I learn it easiest?",

Bring open ears and your honest questions. Explain that you’re doing your first project and that you need their help to make a better drawing set. They know what’s missing for their process better than some strangers on the Internet.\n\nGD&T is a very specific form of tolerancing for high precision components and process control measures, eg communication of engineering data. Unless your machinist explicitly prefers it (unlikely), adopting it will not help communicate your design more easily.\n\nCommunication of your design is a hard skill on its own. You need another human to understand everything you need and will check on this component, and you need to describe to another human how to make the component. .\n\nMost modern machine shops accept CAD files now, which they’ll use as a guide for the majority of the part, and then only reference the paper drawing for critical quality control dimensions. So, in that context you’d only need a drawing for the interfaces, the things you will check with a caliper or another tool. Typically point to point dimensions for critical references are used here, specific bore callouts, etc. If you’re not going to check anything you don’t need a paper drawing.\n\nMaking a paper drawing set for manual manufacturing processes is a completely different skill, where you will need to communicate all the dimensions they need to actually produce the part by hand on the paper. Typically an ordinate dimension scheme is used here, so that the machinist can take one reference and then do all their machining from that one point. If you don’t know how to make the component, it will be difficult to set up your dimensions to describe how. You may need to sit down with your machinist and listen to them for a while to better understand the problem",

There are not enough hours in the day for you AND the manufacturing kids to learn it.  You could consider including the common symbols in your drawings, and teach their meanings as time and energy permits, but I wouldn’t expect much.  The students are often having enough difficulty keeping things in (simple) tolerance and adding further constraints to the dimensions are not going to make it easier. At the FRC level and possibly a young learner of creating technical drawings, I would suggest you first become very proficient at dimensioning drawing.  Make the dimensions complete, not redundant, not ambiguous, minimizes the maker doing a lot of math, toleranced appropriately, use notes, etc.\n\nI used to be proficient in the use of GD&T, but I have’t actively used it in 25 years.  -I’ve forgotten a lot.  Having said that, as the internal machinist in several companies, I found it much more useful to walk over to the engineer/designer and have a conversation about what was important  (and not) on a drawing they gave me.  I could then best provide them what they wanted.\n\nAlso, do you have the ability to inspect and check the parts as drawn with GD&T?  If not, then how do you know you’re getting what your “paid” for?  Adding GD&T, tight tolerances, over tolerance, etc. cost money.  -“money” could be currency, or the extra time/energy/frustration that is spent trying to make your part.\n\nhummingbird451:\n\nWe also do not have access to CNC machining that does not require technical drawings.\n\nCNC machinery is not a requirement to use GD&T. You can use it on parts made with a hacksaw and file\n\nhummingbird451:\n\nShould I start using GD&T? If so, how can I learn it easiest?\n\nIf engineering is in your future goals, I would say yes, learn it.  But take your time as you likely won’t need it during your time in FRC .\n\nCoincidentally, I receive an email this week that led to this link: link to GD&T Introduction I am NOT endorsing this paper, I just happened to see it this week.  There are many other sources.\n\nIf you want to use GD&T, keep it simple and use just the basics:  True Position, concentricity, parallelism, perpendicularity, circularity, straightness, flatness and angularity.  That should cover most(?) things that you would likely design.  But as I already mentioned, first learn to dimension your drawing well.",

Not even because they end up making crappy parts, it’s mostly because we have very few and very short meeting times and I am usually actively doing other important things as the machinist is making parts, so I don’t want to keep having to babysit them.\n\nSpecifically, there is a mentor who asks a lot of questions about my drawing to help the machinist make the part. (It’s not that this annoys me, my mentor is definitely right, and my drawings are, I guess “not good enough.”)\n\nAnd another part of having less time is not having time to have students like me be taught how to make effective drawings.\n\nAnd since that’s out of the way, my overall question is:\n\nHow should I take the step from my beginner level to a better understanding of how to effectively communicate my intent of the part with a drawing without wasting my time explaining the entire part function face to face?\n\n(I use OnShape)",

Let’s just make that clear.\n\nThat said, I’ve marked up and sent back drawings on my team, for missing dimensions.\n\nYou ask what you should do to communicate the intent of the part in a drawing. I think you’re approaching the question wrong. Clear communication is important… but it gets easier when both sides have common ground. This isn’t a CAD problem.\n\nIMO, your first step is to learn how to machine, with the tools used. Make parts from drawings. Maybe even from drawings you’ve made, but mark them up as you go with missing dimensions and/or notes.\n\nTHEN you’ll understand better what’s missing in the drawings you’ve been sending for machining. Add that in, and you’ll have a much easier time.",

Like most situations in life,  good communication (which includes active listening) is paramount.\n\nAnother thing to consider:  Your machinist at school are probably as inexperienced as you.  They too are in a learning environment.  You might give them a perfect drawing that any professional machine shop could give you exactly what you ask for, and your peers would still struggle.\n\nFWIW, in my 30 years of machining professionally, I doubt there was a week that went by when I didn’t have questions about a dimension or feature on a part.  …these drawing were coming from name recognizable, multi billion dollar, medical, tech, defense, aerospace… companies as well as little start ups and “mom and pop” businesses.\n\nDon’t be too hard on yourself.

If you’re a regular CAD user much of this is probably second nature, but make sure that the drawing can only be interpreted 1 way.\n\nIs there a consistent datum? Pick a corner, aka a point where 3 faces meet, all locations should be dimensioned from these three faces unless you have a important reason not to.\n\nIf there is a measurement that is much more important than the others, dimension that measurement and label it as critical and/or with a tolerance.\n\nOn a related note… Use reasonable standard tolerances. There’s a good chance there is already a standard tolerance in your title block if you’re using one, and if there isn’t any standard tolerance on the drawing, make sure you and the machinist have the same expectation on tolerance. But for the love of everything holey, if you have a standard tolerance, make sure it makes sense mathematically, and for the material and manufacturing process in question. One of my former employers used the same tolerance on all drawings: X.XXX ±  0.003, X.XX ± 0.010, X.X ± .015. This meant that we had stuff like 32.0±0.015 on molded plywood that suppliers couldn’t get better than ± 0.25 on, and if you wanted 5/8\" but didn’t need it to be very precise rounding to a single decimal place would result in perfect accuracy to the CAD model not being in spec. All our suppliers ignored our tolerances and when parts came in to get inspected I  would have to fill out a sheet that documented exactly how much they failed to meet 75% of the dimensions by and then wrote approved at the top.",

It better communicates design intent to the machine shop and ensures the parts / tolerance stackups actually fit as intended. Interns at J&J (perhaps in general in the industry) are not expected to have learned GD&T, and nearly all haven’t fully. It is something that be taught on the job with guidance and reviewing from peers.",

That should cover most(?) things that you would likely design. But as I already mentioned, first learn to dimension your drawing well.\n\nI don’t know that I would even agree these are simple or the basics.\n\nPosition is virtually unmeasurable for a FRC team (also, pedantic, but “true position” is a misnomer - that is the theoretically perfect position of the feature - “position” is the GD&T tolerance that dictates the zone the feature’s axis must reside inside of)\n\nConcentricity is a bad callout that doesn’t mean what people think it means (and it consequently has been removed from Y14.5 as of 2018).\n\nCircularity is nearly useless as it only controls form and not orientation. Cylindricity is useful, but hard to measure\n\nStraightness is maybe useful and stands a chance of being measurable by a FRC team, but still, probably not necessary as we have a tendency to just force less stiff things into alignment by more stiff things.\n\nFlatness is actually reasonably measurable, but again probably doesn’t matter much for FRC purposes\n\nAngularity is a nearly useless callout and can’t easily be measured by FRC teams\n\nIf you’re going to be a ME, eventually you’ll want a strong working knowledge of GD&T. If you exit college knowing what all the symbols are used for and what they control, you’re way ahead of the curve, even if you don’t know exactly how to apply them or what tolerances/datum reference frames would be appropriate.\n\nGD&T is of zero use in FRC though.",

When I learned GD&T at a several days long Mitutoyo class long ago, True Postion (changed to Position in 2009) and Concentricity were taught.  Best practices are always being updated and I have not kept up.\n\nOut of curiosity, which GD&T symbols would you consider simple and/or basic that a student should begin with?",
