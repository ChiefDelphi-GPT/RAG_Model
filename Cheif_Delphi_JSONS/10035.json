Simplest: keep the LED data wires SHORT.\n\nWhat We Did\n\nGiven good success using “smart” RGB LED strips driven directly by the RoboRIO last year, my team, 4795, decided to use them again for Hydra, our robot for Charged UP.  We followed the usual software guide: Addressable LEDs — FIRST Robotics Competition documentation\n\nThis season, the LEDs mainly signal the humanplayer which game piece is desired.  Some additional colors and patterns also show some software-debugging status.\n\nWe used three strips, two up vertical structural members, and one inside the rotating arm .  Just like last year, all strips are fed the same data stream from the RoboRIO, using PWM “Y” cables to split the data.  Each strip is wired with heavier 5V power and ground wires and a scrap of PWM cable with a connector for data and data-ground.  Power wires from each strip run directly to 5v outputs from a VRM.\n\nWS2812-LED-wiring 1920×543 88.3 KB\n\nWS2812-LED-wiring 1920×543 88.3 KB\n\nWS2812-LED-wiring 1920×543 88.3 KB\n\nws2812-led-wiring-sketch 567×564 88.9 KB\n\nws2812-led-wiring-sketch 567×564 88.9 KB\n\nws2812-led-wiring-sketch 567×564 88.9 KB\n\nSplitting the data stream with a “Y” cable makes the wiring neater: we don’t have to daisy chain from the “output” end of one strip across or back down the robot structure and over to the next strip of LEDs.  We also don’t have to duplicate the data in software to guarantee that we show the same pattern on every strip so it can be seen from all angles.\n\nOur original LED strips we believe came from Rev, although we’re not 100% sure since we’ve had them since last season\n\nREV Robotics designs, builds and manufactures robotics parts and components used by students for learning about science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). Our parts are commonly used within the FIRST Robotics Competition and the FIRST Tech...\n\nPrice: USD 24\n\nThe Problem\n\nAll was good at the UNC-Ashville competition until one of the strips was broken in a collision with another robot.  The pit crew replaced the damaged strip with another from a different source.  That one was from Amazon:\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GSCJPMD\n\nThe replacement strip shows bright white when the others are magenta, and a bright, pale green when the others are yellow.  (See picture at the top of this post.)  I guessed at this point that there must be some difference in the chips inside these two different “WS2812B compatible” LED strips - but what?\n\nDebugging and Speculation\n\nWhen we fed the robot’s three LED strips with properly formatted data from an Arduino running a WS2812 LED demo program ( GitHub - adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel: Arduino library for controlling single-wire LED pixels (NeoPixel, WS2812, etc.) ), all three Y-connected strips show the same, correct colors.\n\nThinking about the data stream for these LED strips, I got to wondering: what could turn some of the “0” bits into “1” bits, resulting in a brighter, washed-out appearance?\n\nIf we google the datasheet for these parts ( https://www.digikey.com/en/datasheets/parallaxinc/parallax-inc-28085-ws2812b-rgb-led-datasheet ), we see that “0” bits are represented by narrow pulses (400ns), and “1” bits by wider pulses (800ns).  A complete date bit is about 1200ns, for a data rate of about 800 Kbps.  This is a form of pulse-width modulation, although quite different (and much faster) than the PWM used by servos and motor controllers.\n\nThe RoboRIO documentation isn’t very good on electrical charateristics of its outputs, and there’s no schematic for the RoboRIO.  Brief rant: NI doesn’t need to provide a complete schematic, but enough shematic of each input and output to fully document (and support teaching about) the interfaces should be required.\n\nThe RoboRIO V2 documentation does say that the PWM outputs are rated for “Maximum Frequency 150KHz”.  There’s the first problem: the LED data stream is much faster than that.  But it works for many teams, at least sometimes.\n\nThe RoboRIO V2 documentation also says “the lines on the PWM and Relay ports all have 40KΩ pulldown resistors to ground”, along with a schematic fragment.\n\nrio-pwm-pulldown 1062×753 37.1 KB\n\nrio-pwm-pulldown 1062×753 37.1 KB\n\nrio-pwm-pulldown 1062×753 37.1 KB\n\nWhich leads me to wonder, do the PWM outputs not really drive “low” (pull the pin to ground) very well? Is that pulldown resistor the only thing sinking current?\n\nWhat exactly do motor controllers do with the PWM signal, anyway? What kind of circuit is the RoboRIO probably designed to drive?\n\nThe only FIRST-legal motor controller for which I’ve seen a schematic was the original Jaguar, also known as the “Texas Instruments Stellaris microcontroller reference design kit.”  It uses an opto-isolator on the PWM input, with the PWM data directly driving the LED in the isolator:\n\njaguar-pwm-in 753×193 13.6 KB\n\njaguar-pwm-in 753×193 13.6 KB\n\njaguar-pwm-in 753×193 13.6 KB\n\nThis is quite nice, as the pwm is completely isolated from the potentially-noisy motor power.  This only requires the RoboRIO (or cRIO!) PWM output to drive “high” (+5 volts), and not to sink much current.\n\nBut if the RoboRIO’s PWM outputs actually are designed especially for this, they’ll actually perform quite poorly for faster data (with narrower pulses).\n\nAnd there we have my best guess as to the problem: The RoboRIO’s PWM outputs are being asked to drive faster data than they’re designed for, and they do a poor job of pulling the signal back “low”.  If there’s much stray capacitance in the wiring - say from wires that are rather long, or multiple LED strips Y-cabled to the same data - the falling edges of the data bits will be slowed down, making some or all of the “0” bits stretch into “1” bits.  (The rising edges won’t be affected much).\n\nI was able to turn the arduino’s “good” LED data stream into a “bad” stream using a diode and a resistor.\n\narduino-rio-emulation 759×340 14.7 KB\n\narduino-rio-emulation 759×340 14.7 KB\n\narduino-rio-emulation 759×340 14.7 KB\n\nThis reliably turns our oddball LED strip to pale, bright, nearly-white colors, while our original LED strip doesn’t seem to mind as much. Here’s a snapshot of two different strips driven through that circuit on my messy workbench.\n\nbench-led-mismatch 1000×692 115 KB\n\nbench-led-mismatch 1000×692 115 KB\n\nbench-led-mismatch 1000×692 115 KB\n\nChanging to a much lower valued resitor restores a good edge rate, and works around the problem.  2.2K or 2.7K works nicely at home on my bench.\n\nThe workaround we’re using on the robot right now is to only drive two strips (one of each type) and disconnect the second Y cable and the long cable (about feet) running up to the rotary arm.  That restored both strips to the correct color for our second event, FNC Wake County, and also for the NC DCMP.\n\nBut for reliably driving a few feet of cable, or multiple LED strips from any vendor, an active buffer circuit would likely be more reliable.  I’ve prototyped this at home with a 74HC04 chip wired as a buffer:\n\nws2812-buffer 1077×609 13.2 KB\n\nws2812-buffer 1077×609 13.2 KB\n\nws2812-buffer 1077×609 13.2 KB\n\nThe prototype breadboard is visible in the photo above.\n\nTesting all of this out on the actual robot and competition-veteran LED strips will probably wait until the end of the season.  Likewise, dragging my oscilloscope into school to verify and demonstrate all of this in detail to the electrical subteam students will also get to wait until after our last event - which we hope is in Houston! Update: yes, our first order of business is getting the team and robot to the championship! Look for me if you want to talk robot electronics!\n\nSteve",

I wonder if the new strip has a very poor input characteristic that is not particularly high impedance?\n\nI’ll also note that Y-splitting signal lines can result in very poor signal integrity due to reflections.\n\nYou can also adjust the bit timings the FPGA outputs.",

But this would be wired in a similar way as in the original post, so it’s still more involved than just connecting to the PWM port.\n\nA more involved option is to use something like this part.  You would probably need to make a small custom board though.  This part only uses 10μA from the PMW signal, so you can use several of these with the same PWM signal.  Basically, you connect the input side of this part to the three pins from a PWM port on the roboRIO.  A custom board allows keeping any “Y” very short.  Also, it makes it easy to include bypass capacitors, which can be important in this type of circuit.\n\nThe output side is also three pins, and would be powered by the same power supply providing power to the LED strip.  This ensures there is no possibility of a ground loop, and (again) the output signal does not have to be used with more than a single strip.  The output stage is designed for this type of application (with no series resistor).",

Put one as close to the roborio as possible, and then run a longer wire and/or your splitter after the first led. Pretty much all buffer their output signal, so you’ll get a clean signal out of that first light. So in essence it becomes a buffer. This also helps because we’ve ran into cases where bad power causes the first light to die. It’s much easier to replace it when it’s easily accessible.",

The oscilloscope will tell for sure, but I’ll bet that reflections aren’t an issue: with that 330 ohm series resistor in the RoboRIO output and the capacitance from a few feet of wiring, the risetime will be long compared to the propagation delay.\n\nUsing one of the LEDs as a buffer - with bonus as a test indicator - is indeed brilliant!  One of the datasheets I have (SK2812) lists the output current as 50 mA, which is much beefier than the 'HC04. For even better signal integrity, one could use source-series termination, putting a 100 or 120 ohm resistor in series with the driver, right near the driver.   Feeding several strips in parallel would best be done with seperate buildout resistors from the same driver, or parallel drivers.    Longish runs out to the LED strips would be better done with twisted pair cable - just like CAN bus.\n\nBe sure to power that first buffer chip or LED from 5 volts (say from a handy RoboRIO DIO pin), not from the 6v on the PWM port. I should have thought of using one LED as a buffer - our programmers have a little two-LED assembly (with seperate connections for PWM data and DIO-power) they use to test code with only a RoboRIO when a full strip and seperate VRM isn’t handy.   Looks like this, and just needs a data-output connector.\n\nAlso, some of the tutorials on these LED strips recommend a series resistor in the data line near the LED’s data input pin.  Apparently some of them can be damaged by providing data without power, a comon issue with CMOS devices. I also worry about the ground wire running along with the data wire trying to put all of the LED return current through the PWM connector if the ground wire running from the LEDs to the VRM becomes disconnected.\n\nSteve",
