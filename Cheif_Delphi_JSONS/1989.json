                    "cooked": "After two years of testing and development, team 3737 is pleased to release our latest 3D printed swerve drive. Our goal was to enable us (and any team) to manufacture a relatively low cost but competition capable swerve drive using a quality FDM 3D printer. To this end, we have provided with the CAD model, step-by-step assembly instructions, full BOM, complete print settings and a speed calculator for various gearing and drive motors. The swerve assembly is designed to bolt to the underside of a 3030 T-slot chassis (see 3737’s robot release of BB Mantis). This lightweight but strong chassis design also provides immense versatility with infinitely variable bolting positions on all faces.\n\nThe base design uses NEO drive and NEO550 steer motors. However, all current FRC legal brushless drive motors are possible (serrated shaft prints are provided).\n\nNote that this assembly uses the ‘standard’ 4” x 1.5” Aluminum billet wheel. However, we have separately developed a fully interchangeable, FDM 3D printable, TPU ‘suspension tread’ wheel assembly (see end of this post for link).\n\nSome highlights are:\n\nFully 3D printed design in PETG (excl. bearings, most gears and fasteners)\n\nCompetition tested\n\nRelatively low cost (vs metal framed swerve drive)\n\nVarious drive motors possible\n\nFive available drive gear ratios\n\nDrive speed gearing can be changed by 2 or 3 steps with removal of two screws\n\nCalculated max free speed: NEO: 15.41 ft/sec NEO Vortex: 18.42 ft/sec Falcon 500: 17.32 ft/sec Kraken X60: 16.29 ft/sec\n\nNEO: 15.41 ft/sec\n\nNEO Vortex: 18.42 ft/sec\n\nFalcon 500: 17.32 ft/sec\n\nKraken X60: 16.29 ft/sec\n\nFull assembly size (with SparkMax controllers): 5.35”wide (136 mm) 7.02” long (178 mm) 9.11” high (231 mm)\n\n5.35”wide (136 mm)\n\n7.02” long (178 mm)\n\n9.11” high (231 mm)\n\nSwerve assembly (incl. Aluminum wheel & tread) weights: W/O motors, UP gearboxes & SM controllers: 2.5 lbs (1.136 kg) With motors, UP gearboxes, w/o SM controllers: 4.68 lbs (2.121 kg) With SM controllers: 5.24 lbs (2.379 kg)\n\nW/O motors, UP gearboxes & SM controllers: 2.5 lbs (1.136 kg)\n\nWith motors, UP gearboxes, w/o SM controllers: 4.68 lbs (2.121 kg)\n\nWith SM controllers: 5.24 lbs (2.379 kg)\n\n4” dia. x 1.5” wide wheel with center 2.75” from edges of chassis.\n\nEnclosed design to virtually eliminate pickup of dust and carpet\n\nVirtually zero maintenance\n\nFully manufacturable in-house\n\nBrushless motors\n\nDrive motor assembly is removable with two screws\n\nSteer motor & gearbox assembly is removable with two screws\n\nSwerve assembly is removable from chassis with four screws\n\nEncoder is removable without disassembling the swerve drive\n\nSimple wire management\n\nIntegrated motor controllers with full status light visibility and plug accessibility\n\nManufacturable in any available filament colors (including your teams’ colors)\n\nCAD models of seven printable tools and jigs are supplied to simplify manufacture\n\nComments and questions are welcome. If you use it, we’d love to hear and be credited.\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZQC3a7gMxewyTUdJOlmf7fr8g3cw6-PB?usp=sharing\n\nSuspension treads link:\n\nRelease of 3d printed suspension treads from frc team 3737 CAD",

We have been using 1/4\" Delrin balls in a PETG printed V grooves for 2 years (in separate swerve drives of course) during both on and off season competitions and have had no problems. This year, our drivers managed to get some ‘air-time’ off the charge station with no ill effects. We will be using this design on our competition bot in a few weeks (assuming the terrain is suitable for swerve). I just did the calculation - in static mode, each contact point on each Delrin ball takes just 2.8oz for a full weight robot.",

EDIT: nevermind, I see you’ve run these in season already. Wow!\n\nGlad to see the as5600 get some love. Do beware that the magnets that ship with those often aren’t diametric magnets at all. Also, did you need to pull R4 off the PCB before using it? I wasn’t able to get an analog output before doing that or it would be stuck in programming mode. You can use pliers to remove.",

Dab the two solder blobs with a soldering iron to neaten them and ensure no connection). In summary: Follow the instructions provided AND remove R4.",

However, for cost, compactness and weight, we settled on the NEO500 for steering.  It does a stellar job, paired with the UP 4:1 and 3:1 gearboxes. We have had no failures.\n\nHowever, an innovative single print could adapt the two mount points to accept a full size motor. Don’t forget that the NEO runs at 1/2 the speed of the NEO550 and with the extra power, you only need 1/2 the reduction. I suggest that 3:1 would be fine. Cheers.",
