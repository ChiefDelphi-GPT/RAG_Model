And mostly if it is even realistic to expect to know it well enough to code the robot with it, given the limited time until the season\n\nSo, from teams who have used it How hard is it to learn and use C++? What are the main compromises when using C++? Is AdvantageKit supported?\n\nCheers",

It consisted of reading chapters from a textbook, solving selected exercises (ones that looked reasonably interesting), then doing rounds of code review until their code worked and was clean. Their solutions were submitted through Git.\n\nThe important language features to learn are variables, control flow, and functions. We typically left classes for in-season because it’s not used that much in robot code, and students could just pattern-match on our previous code when writing new code.\n\nGeneral curriculum: Curriculum and instruction - FRC Team 3512 Intro C++ curriculum: Intro to C++ - FRC Team 3512\n\nIn my experience, students do fine with C++, even as a first language, as long as they learn modern best practices from the start. The main thing that avoids memory issues is using value types wherever you can instead of pointers, and avoiding the new keyword like the plague.\n\nOblarg:\n\nThis means you must understand the heap and the stack.\n\nWe didn’t focus on that concept much at all, actually. Basically everything we wrote used value types, so everything was on the stack and had strictly nested scope. Everything executed on the main robot thread except for our 2020 vision subsystem (NT event listener with thread-safe circular buffer to send data to the main robot thread; WPILib has a thread-safe queue now).\n\nWe used address, UB, and thread sanitizers in CI, of course, but I don’t think they ever caught any bugs. Keeping the code structure simple helped.\n\nWihy:\n\nWhat are the main compromises when using C++?\n\nThe main downsides are due to Java being much more popular. Java and C++ are at 90% and 5% marketshare respectively.\n\nLess community help and OSS code\n\nVendors and thirdparty projects sometimes not providing C++ ports of their libraries\n\nWihy:\n\nIs AdvantageKit supported?\n\nIt is not. AdvantageKit is a library written by 6328 for 6328, and they use Java.",

So we’re switching to Java like most other teams are using in 2025.\n\nNot that C++ isn’t great to know and learn, but Java seems to be the least-friction language for FRC teams to use right now for your main season.",

I admit I have a personal dislike for C++ and I’d rather just write plain old elegant C. Rust has become popular for very good reasons.\n\nThis is a major change, but every team is unique and must make their own decisions. Personally, I’d at least want the following to be true:\n\nYour school teaches C++\n\nYour mentor software team is proficient in (or even prefers) C++\n\nYour student software team wants this\n\nYou’ve identified a path to reach equivalent functionality as last season.\n\nKeep in mind that your code will become a reference for future students. How likely is the team to keep using C++ after you leave?",

As a result, incoming students often ask why we use C++ since their old teams all used Java, and I give basically the same response of thats what our school/university teaches. This does mean that most will spend their first semester learning C++ before really being able to write substantial code for the robot, but since they’re going to be constantly writing C++ code for class, it doesn’t really make sense for us to continue teaching a different language especially for those who don’t have prior experience with programming.\n\nWe even apparently switched over from Java sometime between 2018 and 2022. I really doubt our team had a software mentor at any point of its history, so it probably was the singular person assigned to programming just choosing what they’re familiar with.",
