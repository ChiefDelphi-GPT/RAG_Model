                    "cooked": "We currently have a vision system with four ArducCams (OV9281), and two OrangePis (OrangePi 5 Plus), with two ArduCams connected to each. Then, we have a Limelight 3G, which has PhotonVision installed on it, and acts as a normal PhotonVision camera and coprocessor. During the Mishawaka competition, our pose was VERY good, and we had no PathPlanner jitter. However, when we came back to our shop, we have a noticeable amount  of jitter. This is weird, because we checked our apriltags in the shop, and they’re all within an inch of the actual field. We did some testing, and realized that if two cameras (for example, one of the ArduCams and the Limelight camera) both look at one tag, the position they calculate is a bit different from each other (the rotation of that estimated pose if the same for both cameras, but its translation is about half a meter off for both of them). We have triple-checked our camera constants , but this error keeps on happening with our pose estimation. We also tried not adding any vision measurements that have a high ambiguity, but even if 2 cameras are looking at the same AprilTag, and they have a very low ambiguity, there is still a different for the pose estimate for both cameras.\n\nWe have spent a lot of time trying to make all 5 cameras work in sync so that it would make our position better, but for some reason, it seems to make it worse, since all the cameras seem to have a different opinion of where the AprilTag they’re looking at actually is, even if they’re looking at the same AprilTag. We really think that we can make our pose estimation much better, to the point that the estimated pose is within 2 inches of the actual pose, but we don’t know how to get there. Any help would really help us .\n\nOur robot code is located at GitHub - FRC4926/ReefscapeMain at elevatorV2 (our latest code is in the elevatorV2 branch!), and our code for pose estimation is located in ReefscapeMain/src/main/java/frc/robot/subsystems/VisionSubsystem.java at elevatorV2 · FRC4926/ReefscapeMain · GitHub .",

Have you try reverting back to the competition code if you did change anything, and restarting from there?\n\nDid any camera calibrations change?\n\nEven though the individual poses are off, is the overall pose still accurate?\n\nIs there a specific camera that’s off?\n\nCould the coprocessor be overheating?\n\nDoes the robot still move to the correct position despite the PathPlanner jitter?\n\nWhat is your PhotonPoseEstimator pose strategy? Have you tried messing with it?\n\nI’m seeing a lot of commented-out code. Is any of it necessary for a good pose? Would removing it help with organization?\n\nI hope this helps!",
