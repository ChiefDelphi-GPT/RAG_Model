This can be about the library itself, tools, or documentation.\n\nI like to structure this kind of feedback ask as looking for the good, the bad, and the ugly:\n\nThe good (this was awesome, please keep doing it) : What worked well? What did you find particularly beneficial to your team? What would you like to see more of?\n\nThe bad (don’t repeat this, please figure out how to improve it ): What didn’t work? What did you struggle with? What would you like to see changed?\n\nThe ugly (worse than bad, please aim to never let this happen again) : What did you have to hack around to make it work for you? What made figuring out the right solution more difficult for you (e.g. wasted precious time)?\n\n( Other feedback structures such as Start/Stop/Continue or Thorns/Roses/Buds are also welcome–whatever works for you!)\n\nWe’re currently working on our plans/priorities for next year (we’re also working to finalize updates to our longer-term roadmap to share with the community). Suggestions are certainly welcome, but I’ll note that since WPILib is an all-volunteer effort / community project, the best way to see a feature get implemented is to implement it yourself, or get someone in the community interested in implementing it. We welcome both ideas and contributors!",

Any time I or one of my students had a question where my first reaction was “well surely someone has written the answer for this down somewhere”, I would go there before doing a CD search, because we had about a 75%-80% chance of finding the answer on our first search. Keep up the good work and the great documentation is really appreciated!",

Huge thanks to all the WPILib maintainers lurking in the FRC discord answering questions tirelessly.\n\nAdvantageScope being shipped with WPILib. I cannot say enough good things about AdvantageScope it has made the way I debug code so much nicer compared to Shuffleboard in 2023.\n\nThe beta release system was really nice, being able to see the differences in how WPILib would work for the coming year early without having to link to local development builds.\n\nNot having a good driver dashboard shipped with WPILib is a bit annoying. Shuffleboard is pretty dead if something like Elastic (incredible, thank you so much to the developer it was a great experience this year) being shipped with WPILib could be nice.\n\nDocumentation for GradleRIO feels lacking for more advanced tasks with things like the vendordep json file specification being… undocumented? Along with this there are a few things which just have really painful error messages to understand if you don’t know whats happened eg. GradleRIO#710 or GradleRIO#727 . Again the support around this was really good seeing some of these issues before encountering them was really good allowing me to help people out when they encounter them later.\n\nHuge thanks to the WPILib team and maintainers of community projects for the incredible experience programming for FRC this year!",

Renaming one might leave the old name behind, or show deleted autos, which probably is somewhat confusing to people that haven’t found the build.gradle lines to clear the build directory.",

                    "cooked": "The Good: This was our first season really making use of WPILIB (we were previously LabVIEW), and overall we had great success with it all and the documentation was extremely helpful and clear. I can’t imagine our robot being even half as capable without WPILIB, so kudos to the whole team that works on it and thanks so much - you all do invaluable work. We were also impressed with how much was available to us as a RobotPy team, it was a rare moment when we encountered something we weren’t able to replicate from Java examples. Overall great experience, had very few issues or bugs even in the first year of RobotPy official support.\n\nThe tools that shipped with WPILIB this year were also extremely reliable and super useful. AdvantageScope being packaged with WPILIB was genuinely incredible and has started us on a path towards more effective failure analysis.\n\nThe new RobotPy installer was fantastic and simplified our deployment process significantly. I know this was a close-to-the-season-start kind of thing, but it was an extremely good change so I want to point it out in particular. It was much easier to get the new process across to students.\n\nThe Bad: We had some frustration with the changes to SysID this year. We relied on it in the offseason to tune our swerve drivetrain for the first time, and while we knew it would be changing for the season decently early, the changes weren’t available to us for use in time for us to actually USE SysID this year. There still isn’t a Python example available, and we’re still not entirely clear on how to integrate it into our code from the Java/C++ examples.\n\nThis is more than likely a structural issue, but we did have some amount of trouble with loop overruns this year. We were never overrunning by more than a couple of milliseconds even with our poor optimization, but of course that still issues the warning at a very high frequency, which made it super annoying to track any actual errors that may have come up in testing. Maybe this already exists and I couldn’t find it, but some way to suppress the warning like you can with “Joystick Unplugged” warnings would help us (I can certainly see the opposite argument where you want teams to pay very close attention when this particular warning arises and don’t want to encourage/allow suppressing the warning).\n\nFor quite some time our software was always failing tests whenever we had a SPARK MAX created anywhere in our code. We started just bypassing tests, which is bad for a number of reasons, and we never circled back to figuring out what was causing it. Feels worth mentioning, I think I heard some others had a similar problem.\n\nThe Ugly: When Shuffleboard works, it’s great. When it doesn’t work, it’s downright infuriating. We had a number of recurring issues with it freezing some or all of the displayed values, not updating properly, or locking buttons and not unlocking them. Occasionally we had issues where it wouldn’t display properly on any monitor, always defaulting to a scale that was too large for our screens no matter what we did to it. Reboots of the operator console computer seemed to fix it just fine, it was just weird and annoying.\n\nI couldn’t decide whether to put this in “Ugly” or “Bad” so it’s going at the bottom as uncategorized. I don’t know if this is really an issue so much as something I’d like to mention was happening to us, but AdvantageScope seems to hang for a very long time before opening. We didn’t have this issue before using it through the WPILIB install, but now it takes a good 30+ seconds to open. This may well be the computers we’re using it on, but I just don’t see this kind of startup latency with any of the other WPILIB tools or frankly any other software on my personal laptop.\n\nAgain, thanks for all you do! WPILIB was an outstanding tool for us this season, and I just want to reiterate how great it’s been!",
