                    "cooked": "Hi all. I’m the programmer mentor for Team 3090. I joined the team at the last minute because they needed programming help. This is only my third week being exposed to everything and I’m still learning a lot about the hardware and software of our robot. I’m struggling to get the code (java) working correctly. I inherited the code from another mentor and am not able to talk with him about the code. I’m struggling a lot to get the code to work correctly. It’s been updated to work with 2025 libraries, compiles, and is deployed to the robot. The wheels move but aren’t working correctly when we use the joystick. We’re using the Logitec model depicted on the FRC WPI Lib site.\n\nWe are using a swerve drive system. Neo Ion motors for the drive and turning motors, SparkMax motor controllers (one for each drive and turn motor), a CTR CANCoder for each wheel, and a Pigeon 2.0 for the gyro. So 8 motors, 8 motor controllers, 4 CANCoders, and 1 gyro. The firmware is up to date on all of the hardware and I’m confident I have the correct IDs for each device.\n\nWe had a scrimmage this weekend and we were able to get as far as getting the wheels to move. But it looks like when the drive motor moves forward or back, the turn motor also spins. A coder from another team, who IMO seemed to know his stuff, spent over an hour trying to troubleshoot the code. He said he’s never seen this problem before. My takeaway from all of this, is I think we need to start from scratch. I think a bug or series of bugs got introduced when migrating, updating, and changing code (from this n00b) and that is causing the problem. I don’t know enough about swerve drive code to effectively debug the problem. I think if I can start from scratch and slowly add functionality, that the code will be better and I’ll better understand it.\n\nI’m looking for help to get started. I’ve watched lots of YouTube videos ( FRC O to Autonoumous) and looked at lots of swerve code, but they all seem to have small differences that don’t translate well to writing code in 2025. For example, updating code to fix the breaking changes in going from Rev Robotics libraries in 2024 to 2025. So it’s been confusing to both translate code to be relevant today and to understand the classes and methods needed to make the robot move correctly.\n\nCan someone point me in the right direction to learn how to get a basic program up and running. I’d like to get a basic project created that gets our robot moving correctly.\n\nIf anyone is curious, our existing codebase is here: GitHub - ramhawks/Robot2025\n\nHuge thanks ahead of time for any help you can provide.",

                    "cooked": "Thanks for all of the advice. I created a new project based on the YAGSL project and got it configured for our robot. I was able to push the code to the robot, and the motors work via the controller. Woot!\n\nWhile the motors work, I don’t think things are calibrated correctly and I’m not sure of the steps that need to be taken to ensure everything is calibrated. I can make the motors drive forward and turn, but each wheel is not in sync with the turning and turns a different amount. When at rest the wheels are each oriented in different directions.\n\nIf this should be a new thread, let me know and I’ll create one.\n\nThis is where my understanding of the big picture gets fuzzy. I need to do more calibration, or at least that’s what I think needs to happen to fix my problem, but I’m not sure how.\n\nThis is what I’ve done so far.\n\nObtained the IDs of the SparkMax motor controllers, CANcoders, roboRIO, and Pigeon2 and added them to the json files.\n\nObtained the weight, spacing between wheels, wheel diameters, gear ratios (drive and turn motors) values and added them to the json files.\n\nSet the wheel orientation to what was shown in the YAGSL docs and used the Phoenix Tuner X client to get the absolute encoder offsets for the CANcoders. I converted the values from rotations to degrees and added them to the json files.\n\nI noticed in the Rev Hardware client that there’s an AbsoluteEncoder tab. Do the SparkMax need to be calibrated as well?\n\nRather than me speculate on what still needs to be done to calibrate and get the machine to a baseline driving state, is there a checklist somewhere that outlines the steps needed to do this?\n\nI’m not sure what I need to do next. Thanks again in advance for all the help. I really appreciate it.\n\nP.S. I do have the radio working and can control the robot in either a wired or wireless state.",

Put the robot up on blocks.\n\nDrive forwards, the drive left.  Are the wheels turning 90 degrees?  When you drive forward again do they all straighten out again?  If they are not all in alignment then you probably have an offset that needs tuned.  If they are returning back to the same place after going forward and then left and the straight, I’m pretty confident it is an offset issue.  If they aren’t turning 90 degrees then you might have a gear ratio issue.\n\nOnce you get that nailed down power cycle the robot and check it again.\n\nIf all is good and then one or more wheels stop returning to center over time with driving, etc.  Your magnets that the absolute encoders are using need to be superglued in place.\n\nGood luck!",
