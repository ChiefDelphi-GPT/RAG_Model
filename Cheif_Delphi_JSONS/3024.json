                    "cooked": "This will be the Chief Delphi thread for Choreo 2025 releases and support.\n\nThe post marked as “Solution” in this thread points to the latest release.\n\nChoreo (Constraint-Honoring Omnidirectional Route Editor and Optimizer, pronounced /koʊˈɹiːoʊ/, like K + “Oreo”) is a graphical tool for planning time-optimized trajectories for the FRC autonomous mode. Each trajectory takes full advantage of the drivetrain’s performance, while obeying its dynamics constraints, such as top speed and maximum acceleration on each module. Choreo provides a variety of additional constraints that affect the generated trajectory, such as waypoints, keep-in and keep-out zones, limits on speed and acceleration, etc. Choreo provides a vendor library to load and follow the trajectories, but they are also compatible with PathPlannerLib.\n\nThank you to all the teams that used Choreo in 2024 and shared your needs, struggles, and suggestions for improvement. Our work for 2025 has focused on many issues and enhancements.\n\nWe have moved our documentation site to a new domain, https://choreo.autos .\n\nThis feature addresses a few struggles in 2024 Choreo:\n\nDefault units (SI, radians) being inflexible, unintuitive, and forcing the user to convert by hand.\n\nNo good way to define field constants or waypoint locations that are shared among all trajectories.\n\nNo good way to define robot configuration in terms of other constants (i.e. bumper size and module placement in terms of frame size.\n\nTo fix these, we have replaced almost every number input in the application with mathematical expression inputs, powered by (mathJS)[ https://mathjs.org/ ].\n\nMathJS has full dimension awareness, so you can use whichever unit you like, and it will reject inputs that are not dimensionally correct.\n\nChoreo allows you to define a project-wide set of variables that can be substituted into any appropriate expression in the project. Variables can be defined as single numbers with a variety of dimensions, but Choreo also has aggregate variables to organize the x, y, and heading components of an important pose.\n\nThe expression and variable features open up a wide range of capabilities, similar to parametric sketches in a CAD program. We’re excited to see how teams use these new tools.\n\nChoreo 2024 asked for a wheelbase, track width, bumper length, and bumper width. This described many robots, but especially in 2024, many robots had intakes that made the bumpers not centered at the center of rotation, or they had module placement that was not centered or even rectangular. Choreo 2025 makes robot configuration more flexible, permitting and honoring these configurations.\n\nNOTE: due to an expectation that 2025 would be a mirrored field like 2023 and 2025, Choreo 2025 currently only supports module and bumper dimensions that are symmetric across the robot x-axis (the front-back line, meaning left-right mirror symmetry). In robot configuration, users only edit the left side of the robot dimensions. Expect this to change, since asymmetric robots work with rotationally symmetric fields.\n\nThe motor calculator presets for determining motor max speed and motor max torque have been removed. Our formula for these has proved to be too aggressive, so the calculator was not helpful for torque values.\n\nThis issue was inherent to the architecture of Choreo, but through the architecture changes related to command-line generation, we were able to make generation individually cancelable at any point.\n\nPreviously, if Choreo did not calculate enough samples for a segment of the trajectory, the only option was a constant sample count override for each segment equally. Now, the target time delta can be set for each path, allowing Choreo to still take the length of the segment into account. Also, each waypoint besides the last one has its own sample count override (see details in the Waypoints section).\n\nFor swerve drive, Choreo 2025 modifies the internal logic of the solver to handle robot rotation as a unit vector instead of an angle number. This allows Choreo to take the fastest rotational movement, even if it would previously wrap -pi to pi and take the long way around. Therefore, heading initial guesses are not as important to manually tweak.\n\nChoreo has added support for differential drive trajectories in ChoreoLib and throughout the application, but some elements of the generator are still in progress. The current version works well enough for many simple trajectories, especially in this game, but we’re not comfortable calling the feature as stable as swerve.\n\nChoreo now ships with a command-line tool that takes in a .chor file and one or more associated .traj, and generates the .traj files, modifying them in-place. Further details will be described in the docs.\n\nChoreo 2025 removes the ability to set the heading initial guess on translation and empty waypoints. Due to the above improvements to the solver, and other logic implemented to automatically calculate heading initial guesses, the feature was unnecessary, counterproductive, and cluttered the UI.\n\nChoreo 2025 removes the (non-constrainable) initial guess point waypoint type and subsumes its functionality into the Empty Waypoint, whose location can be constrained using Keep-In or Keep-Out Zones. The Empty Waypoint can be the endpoint of a path, but not the start point.\n\nInstead of a default sample override being applied to an entire path, with the same number of samples for each waypoint, Choreo 2025 has a checkbox on each waypoint to specify an individual override between that waypoint and the next.\n\nThe user interface for adding and editing constraints has been revised. Previously, a click target for adding a constraint was at every waypoint and the midpoint of every segment. Now, click one waypoint, then click the other, without the UI clutter.\n\nWhen a constraint is selected, the field highlights the range it applies to. For constraints with additional field points/lines to modify (currently Point At, Keep In/Out Zones, and Keep In Lanes), the field will also display draggable field objects tied to the constraint.\n\nThe display also shows when hovering over the constraint in the sidebar.\n\nChoreo 2025 adds a new type of constraint, which is a zone (currently rectangle or circle) that the robot must stay entirely inside, including the bumpers, for the duration of the constraint scope. A Keep-In Rectangle the size of the field will be part of new paths, but disabled by default for performance reasons.\n\nA new constraint, Keep In Lane is an adjustable-width lane that constrains the center of the robot to be between the two parallel edges. This replaces the Straight Line constraint, and can be understood as a Straight Line constraint with a tolerance.\n\nObstacles have been changed to be part of the constraints system and renamed to Keep-Out Circles for consistency. While the solver still struggles in some obstacle setups, the ability to apply the constraint to only a section of the path makes the problem more feasible.\n\nChoreo 2025 adds a checkbox to each constraint that allows the constraint to be disabled without being deleted. This can be useful for comparing the effects of individual constraints.\n\nChoreo 2025 expands the additional checks on the trajectory, performed before starting the solver, which are intended to identify conflicting constraints and other causes of infeasibility. New checks include:\n\nVerifying that Pose waypoints are not used with Point-At constraints\n\nVerifying that 0 Max Angular Velocity constraints do not conflict with Pose waypoints with differing headings\n\nMore to come!\n\nSplitting paths was previously done through a project-wide switch that made every Stop Point constraint be a path splitting point. In 2025, the Stop Point constraint is entirely separate from splitting. Every waypoint except for path endpoints has a checkbox which can be used to mark a waypoint as a split point. NOTE: Choreo does not enforce stopping at split points, but for most usage, adding a Stop Point constraint is still advised.\n\nThe releases now have many more artifacts than last year.\n\nWe support Windows, MacOS, and Linux on both x86_64 and arm64/aarch64 .\n\nUsers should normally be downloading:\n\nWindows: the -setup installers for Windows,\n\nMacOS: the .dmg,\n\nDebian and Ubuntu: the .deb,\n\nFedora: the .rpm\n\nOther Linux: the AppImage\n\nEach of the above except for the AppImage installs the Choreo GUI and a separate executable for command-line generation. We hope to find a way to put the command-line functionality into the main Choreo app.\n\nFinally, we have standalone executables. These are for others to set up unofficial repackaging (i.e. AUR packages for Arch Linux). Using the standalone executables directly is not recommended.\n\nChoreoLib has been added to the vendor dependency manager in WPILib VS Code. This is the recommended way to install ChoreoLib. See our docs for instructions on getting started.\n\nChoreoLib 2025 adds a new kind of auto sequencing library. It lets you build autonomous routines as a set of Triggers running commands instead of as one monolithic command group. With a control flow more similar to binding commands to driver controllers, your default commands and subsystem behavior works just like in teleop. For more on this API, see the AutoFactory docs .\n\nNOTE: Choreo 2025 has no backwards compatibility to upgrade Choreo 2024 projects, but 2025 beta projects can be upgraded to the 2025 stable version without issue.\n\nChoreo 2025 solves a few issues related to the design choices of .chor and .traj files in 2024.\n\nThe prior design, where all “source” data is in one monolithic .chor file, caused issues with auditing changes and merge conflicts in version control.\n\nFurthermore, the practice of exporting split trajectories as individual .traj files was fragile and depended on file system operations to find all the sections.\n\nFinally, the design that put the .chor file in project root and the .traj files in the deploy directory required logic to determine the relative path between the project root and deploy directory. This logic was difficult to maintain and interfered with testing outside a robot project.\n\nWith the addition of event markers, .traj files had to be updated at times other than successful generations.\n\nThe .chor had to save the last generation and a portion of the data used to generate it, for rendering purposes. This duplicated significant information.\n\nWithout a full snapshot of the last generation’s input, the logic to determine if the trajectory needed to be regenerated was hacky and based on the undo history.\n\nTo address the above issues, Choreo 2025 uses the following schema:\n\n.chor:\n\nHolds the robot config and the project-wide variables, as well as other project-wide settings.\n\nNow is placed adjacent to the .traj files. Both .chor and .traj should be in the deploy/choreo directory for robot code integration.\n\nBoth .chor and .traj should be in the deploy/choreo directory for robot code integration.\n\n.traj:\n\nDescribes one continuous trajectory per Choreo “path”. Due to the splitting feature, a single .traj file also contains sample indices which robot libraries can use to split the trajectory.\n\nIs both an input and output file for the app. Deleting the .traj deletes the path completely.\n\nExcept for project-wide information in the .chor, it contains all necessary information for Choreo to present, edit, and generate the trajectory, and for the robot code to load and follow it.\n\nNOTE:\n\nFor debugging purposes, we will now need the full directory including both .chor and all .traj. We have a function in Choreo (“Export Diagnostic Report” in the main menu) to produce a .zip of the project files and program logs, which will be requested when asking for support.\n\nIn general, use the same Choreo GUI and ChoreoLib versions.",

We also now build the UI and CLI for Linux aarch64.\n\nDisable or delete the default field border Keep In Rect constraint on any paths that do not need it. Especially on simpler paths, it has been shown to significantly affect generation time. In this update, the constraint is disabled by default.\n\nBREAKING: .chor files need to be saved in [project root]/deploy/choreo now. Docs here have been updated to match.\n\nFixed a bug with load_trajectory() requiring absolute paths. After doing the above file move, use the trajectory name alone, such as choreo.load_trajectory(\"testPath\") to load [project root]/deploy/choreo/testPath.traj .\n\nFixed several compilation errors, so the C++ library is usable now.\n\nFixed behavior of AutoFactory.trajectoryCmd(...) . It is now a command that requires the drivetrain, so can be used in sequence with resetOdometry as intended.\n\nFixed an issue with the AutoTrajectory.done() Trigger where it would sometimes not switch true at the end of the trajectory, especially when running the trajectory a second time.\n\nFixed a bug where a zero-max-angular-velocity constraint between a pose and translation waypoint would fail in a way that required manual correction beyond undoing that setup.\n\nFixed an issue with two identical waypoints in sequence, which would cause an error about “nonfinite cost or constraints”. Both waypoints now constrain the same sample in the path. This situation is not recommended, but is intended to at least generate if the constraints are compatible.\n\nFixed an issue with variables that depend on other variables. This would cause a UI crash if the dependency variable was deleted. Now it shows the depending variable as an invalid input.\n\nVariables in the variable panel are now visually sorted alphabetically, but still separated between standalone variables and pose variables.\n\nFixed an issue with the icons in the path list, where trajectories would be incorrectly shown as out-of-date upon opening a project.\n\nAdded a Generate All Outdated button above of the path list, next to the Add Path and Duplicate Path buttons.\n\nThe Keep In Rect constraint for the field borders is disabled in new paths. For paths that do not get near the wall, the constraint is an unnecessary performance hit.\n\nNo breaking changes. However, the .chor variables section is now always saved in alphabetical order by variable name. Previously it was nondeterministic and changed almost every time a variable was modified. This change should reduce lines changed in source control diffs.",

Previously it was nondeterministic and changed almost every time a variable was modified. This change should reduce lines changed in source control diffs.\n\nAnother benefit is you see what actually changed. I was looking at diffs of .chor files a few days ago and I couldn’t figure out what actually changed because most of the diff was variables shifting around.",

If there is a way to also generate the same paths for both projects, that would be great, but I can do that by hand, as long as it is at least possible to have this setup.",

Taking out the “Keep In Rectangle” constraint cut down the trajectory generation time by a lot.\n\nAlso a quick question: Do you have any examples on how to use the different types of event markers in Choreo? We’ve been doing good with “Named” markers so far, but we don’t know how to correctly use the other types (Wait, Sequence, Parallel, etc.) in Java.\n\nAny help would be much appreciated.",

MoI modeling is an approximation anyway, especially as large superstructure elements (arms, etc) move across the robot. If MoI is too large, paths with significant rotation will be slower than they could be. If it is too small, the robot won’t be able to keep up, so it’s better to overestimate.",

                    "cooked": "Get It Here!\n\nThis release brings a few features related to variables, some new ChoreoLib AutoTrajectory Triggers, other ChoreoLib bugfixes, and internal changes.\n\nThe waypoint configuration panel now has a searchable input to assign a pose variable to the waypoint. If you type a name that does not exist, it has an option to use the current waypoint expressions for a new pose variable.\n\nThe input does not show the last assigned variable, due to there being no waypoint-wide “assignment” property.\n\nThe search is “fuzzy” so it will include all the variables that include the search text. This means that for reef pose variables such as L1, R1, L2, R2...R6 , typing 1 or L or R might be useful shortcuts.\n\nThe expression fields in the pose variable list are now labeled matching the way they are accessed.\n\nUpdated trajectory schema version to be correct\n\nFixed several major type safety bugs.\n\nSwitched to dataclasses for SwerveSample, SwerveTrajectory, DifferentialSample, DifferentialTrajectory, and EventMarker\n\nAdded mypy type checking to our CI setup to catch further issues.\n\nChanged isAutonomousEnabled checks to isEnabled , allowing Choreo usage in teleop. This does mean AutoRoutines do not automatically end on a transition from auto directly to teleop (a nearly sim-only situation). However, if using RobotModeTriggers.autonomous().whileTrue() or the default template getAutonomousCommand() , those have mechanisms to end the routine when autonomous ends.\n\nThis does mean AutoRoutines do not automatically end on a transition from auto directly to teleop (a nearly sim-only situation).\n\nHowever, if using RobotModeTriggers.autonomous().whileTrue() or the default template getAutonomousCommand() , those have mechanisms to end the routine when autonomous ends.\n\nAdded AutoRoutine.idle() , returning a Trigger that goes false at the start and true at the end of every routine.trajectory.cmd() command. idle() can be true when the routine is not being polled.\n\nDeprecated AutoRoutine.anyDone(...) in favor if AutoRoutine.anyDoneDelayed(...) with identical usage.\n\nAdded AutoRoutine.allInactive(AutoTrajectory, AutoTrajectory...) , returning a Trigger that is true when none of the provided trajectories are running, but the routine is still being polled.\n\nAutoTrajectory : New Triggers, which standardize on seconds instead of cycles for delays. Deprecated done(int cycles) . Added doneDelayed(double seconds) which rises to true a given time after the trajectory ends and falls on the next robot cycle. Added doneFor(double seconds) which rises to true when the trajectory ends and falls after a given time. Added recentlyDone() which rises to true when the trajectory ends and falls when another begins. Added atTimeBeforeEnd(double timeBeforeEnd) which is similar to atTime but offsets from the end of the trajectory.\n\nDeprecated done(int cycles) .\n\nAdded doneDelayed(double seconds) which rises to true a given time after the trajectory ends and falls on the next robot cycle.\n\nAdded doneFor(double seconds) which rises to true when the trajectory ends and falls after a given time.\n\nAdded recentlyDone() which rises to true when the trajectory ends and falls when another begins.\n\nAdded atTimeBeforeEnd(double timeBeforeEnd) which is similar to atTime but offsets from the end of the trajectory.\n\nAutoTrajectory : Other new features Added chain(AutoTrajectory other) which is shorthand for .done().onTrue(other.cmd()) Added spawnCmd() which schedules the .cmd() and ends instantly. This is useful for ending a command group, such as:\n\nAdded chain(AutoTrajectory other) which is shorthand for .done().onTrue(other.cmd())\n\nAdded spawnCmd() which schedules the .cmd() and ends instantly.
