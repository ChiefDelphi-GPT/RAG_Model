Here are lessons learned from our struggles.\n\n@jasondaming wrote some excellent code for this purpose. Thank you Jason! We used it and found it helpful. Be careful to grab the pertinent code from all of the java classes if you are copying and pasting into your own.\n\n@jasondaming wrote some excellent code for this purpose. Thank you Jason!

Otherwise, you risk corrupting the data by pulling the drive while it is being written.\n\nWe mistakenly kept pulling from the logs directory on the rio itself instead of from the USB drive. The .hoot file in the rio logs directory has some state text in it, but no numerical data. This was a great source of frustration for us. You can tell if you have the right .hoot file if it is in the range of 100MB large. To find the log from the USB drive you need to navigate through the directory structure. I think ours was under “/mnt/sda1”, but I could be mistaken.\n\nWe mistakenly kept pulling from the logs directory on the rio itself instead of from the USB drive.

The .hoot file in the rio logs directory has some state text in it, but no numerical data.\n\nThe Phoenix 6 signal logger does not log to both locations at the same time. We log to the first USB drive found at /u/logs , and if there is no USB drive found we switch to logging at /home/lvuser/logs . This is documented in the SignalLogger.setPath() API docs. The logs you’re seeing on the roboRIO are probably older logs; double check the logs’ timestamps.\n\nejzacherl:\n\nOtherwise, you risk corrupting the data by pulling the drive while it is being written.\n\nJust a note on this, in many circumstances the data corruption results in losing the last few seconds of data, but the rest of the file is often still okay. In general though, we recommend stopping the signal logger before pulling the hoot file off the roboRIO.\n\nejzacherl:\n\nYou can tell if you have the right .hoot file if it is in the range of 100MB large.\n\nI’d expect the exported WPILOG to be that large, not the hoot file. A 2-minute hoot file of a swerve drivebase should be around 10-15 MB.\n\nejzacherl:\n\nTo find the log from the USB drive you need to navigate through the directory structure. I think ours was under “/mnt/sda1”, but I could be mistaken.\n\nI haven’t tested it, but you might be able to navigate to /u/logs in the Tuner X download panel to access the USB drive. You can type in the directory at the top of the panel and press Enter to navigate.",

Not challenging the discussion, just trying to hone my understanding.\n\nBmongar:\n\nIS there a mechanism for characterizing for the FOC control requests? The feed forward in FOC is in Amps.\n\nIs this completely accurate? I certainly could be wrong. I agree the units are amps when the control mode is TorqueCurrentFOC. However, if FOC is enabled and the control mode is duty cycle or voltage, aren’t the feedforward units still in duty cycle or voltage, respectively?\n\nBmongar:\n\nSome CTR documentation refers to kT\n\nWhere did you see kT? I could be missing it, but I don’t see it in the documentation or in the API.\n\nBmongar:\n\nIT isn’t swerve characterization but an arm.\n\nAssuming your goal is position control on your arm, TorqueCurrentFOC might not be the best control choice. To quote some info I got from CTRE , “Voltage is generally appropriate for Position based control, as voltage is proportional to the velocity of the motor. Torque is useful for Velocity based control, as torque is proportional to acceleration.” Again, I’m no expert, just sharing my understanding.",

You can run the motor with all of the control modes (even motion magic, etc.), put data on the real-time graph, and tune the gains to see immediate results.\n\nWe don’t have any mechanisms with multiple motors this year, but I imagine that could be harder to tune with this approach.",
