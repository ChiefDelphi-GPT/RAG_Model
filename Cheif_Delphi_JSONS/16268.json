                    "cooked": "Over the last ~year, 1086 has been working on streamlining our machining process for machining aluminum box tube. Our new tube vise is able to hold tube in both the 1\" and 2\" orientations, allows for machining all the way through the tubes, and streamlines the work coordinate system.\n\nThe clamp is cut from 1x3 6061 bar from Xometry and uses a set of Eccentric Hex Clamps . They’re definitely a bit overkill, but we had them on hand. Some small changes could make any of the other sizes on McMaster work fairly well.\n\nimage 1215×786 46.5 KB\n\nimage 1215×786 46.5 KB\n\nimage 1215×786 46.5 KB\n\nimage 857×702 49.2 KB\n\nimage 857×702 49.2 KB\n\nimage 857×702 49.2 KB\n\nimage 886×670 39.8 KB\n\nimage 886×670 39.8 KB\n\nimage 886×670 39.8 KB\n\nimage 700×476 6.54 KB Clamp in 2\" orientation: When machining the 2\" wide faces, the tube rests on the upper “shelf” of the vise. This allows the lower area (highlighted in blue) to serve as a relief so that you can drill/mill all the way through the part without cutting the fixture.\n\nimage 700×476 6.54 KB\n\nimage 700×476 6.54 KB\n\nimage 661×606 6.26 KB Clamp in 1\" orientation: When machining the 1\" wide faces, the tube rests on the lower “shelf” of the vise. This allows the lower area (highlighted in red) to serve as a relief so that you can drill/mill all the way through the part without cutting the fixture.\n\nimage 661×606 6.26 KB\n\nimage 661×606 6.26 KB\n\nimage 822×544 24.8 KB WCS: In both orientations, the clamp provides an end stop in X and a fixed Y position. Because of this, we  can avoid re-zeroing in between different operations, and even between entirely different parts\n\nimage 822×544 24.8 KB\n\nimage 822×544 24.8 KB\n\nimage 4032×3024 1.09 MB While the clamp was designed for 1\" and 2\" tubes, it can accomadate anything smaller than those sizes using parallels to shim the gap between the clamp and tube. Pictured above is a 1.5x1.5 tube shimmed with a 1/2\" parallel.\n\nimage 4032×3024 1.09 MB\n\nimage 4032×3024 1.09 MB\n\nStrength: So far, I’ve had no issues with it. I’ve only pushed a 1/4\" end mill to around 100 IPM (.075  radial, .125 axial), so I certainly wouldn’t expect to, but the clamps are rated for 2k lbs, so I expect to be able to push pretty hard on this in the future.\n\nTube Ends: Prior to making this, I generally machined tube ends using a 3/4\" end mill full depth through the end of the tubes hanging over the vise. Because there’s now material directly under and next to (on the X- edge), this is no longer possible. In order to cut the edge all the way, I cut the top .800\" in the first op, then flipped the part over for op 2 and slip the now-finished shoulder (red edge) into the hard stop so that I could cut the remaining saw-cut edge (blue). This ended up working extremely well, and there’s hardly any cusp from the overlap.\n\nPrice: One of (in my opinion) the biggest strengths to this design is the price. We paid $32 for a 30\" piece of material and cut a 20\" version and 9\" modified version (see photos below for modified version). Even if we purchased 10 clamps instead of using ones on hand, we be spending right around $100, which ends up being pretty cheap compared to some of the COTs options.\n\nCAM: When programming parts, I imported the clamp body into Fusion360, mated it to the part, and set the origin based off of that. It’s an unnecessary step, but I find it to be quick and a good way to double check my WCS.\n\nCAD release: The STEP file  in GrabCAD works, but has every single clamp in both the open and closed position for a 20\" version. The Solidworks files are set up parametrically; edit the “Length” variable in the “Parametric Body” file and the assembly will automatically update. I chose to cut a 20\" one due to machine travel distances, but it could easily be extended to suit whatever length you want.\n\nHolding the clamp: Originally, I was planning on boring holes for 1/2-13 holes to bolt to the bed of the mill. However, because the mill belongs to our sponsor, it makes more sense to put the tube vise into the mill vises than to remove their vises every time we have to machine tube. It wasn’t the solution I had hoped for, but we lose no noticeable rigidity (the 1\" bar is plenty stiff for the forces involved in cutting tube, even when mildly cantilevered). Additionally, the WCS is still constant between operations, so even if I take it out at the end of every day, I’m still only edge finding once per day, a massive improvement over our old tube system. I have CAD with the 1/2-13 holes if anyone is interested.\n\nGrabCAD: A Fond Farewell to GrabCAD Workbench - GrabCAD Blog\n\nMore Pictures: Image from iOS.MOV - Google Drive",

Some small changes could make any of the other sizes on McMaster work fairly well.\n\nThese fixture clamps are awesome.\n\nFor the curious, the common supplier of these is mitee-bite, a brand name that has become somewhat synonymous with any type of cam style work holding clamp. Bonus points for being a New Hampshire based business!\n\nThe miteebite website includes part numbers as well as some application data for these style of clamps. A quick search of the part number on Amazon will yield parts sans Mcmaster tax.\n\nJust because I always dig photos of work holding, here’s another use of these fixture clamps from a recent project; IMG_20210604_144508625 4608×3456 2.07 MB\n\nIMG_20210604_144508625 4608×3456 2.07 MB\n\nIMG_20210604_144508625 4608×3456 2.07 MB",

The only way I could imagine it buckling (the two long faces coming together) shouldn’t be an issue here since I only clamp on the bottom 1/8\" of the tube. However I haven’t done much milling in the “tall” orientation, mostly drilling, so it could be worth testing how aggressive I can get milling in that configuration.",

I don’t know for sure about the accuracy claims, but they sound valid. As far as rigidity, I know mills are almost always significantly more rigid, and I’ve definitely pushed faster than most router posts I’ve seen here. I’m not sure how big a difference that makes in FRC , however, since we aren’t exactly doing production runs.",

We’ll probably stick to using a router for now (or hoping to use a router anyways, don’t actually have one just yet), just because it’d be nice to free up our mill for some neat billet parts, but if I find out there’s any significant benefit to using a mill over a router in practice we might just switch.

We would much prefer to cut our tubes on the Haas with a 3 Flute endmill at 10k RPM than on the router with a 1 flute endmill at ~20k RPM. Plus, if you have anything to drill, you can do it all in one program. Don’t have to babysit the mill quite as much either, again, thanks to flood coolant. Router does have bigger XY travels though.",

The only way I could imagine it buckling (the two long faces coming together) shouldn’t be an issue here since I only clamp on the bottom 1/8\" of the tube. However I haven’t done much milling in the “tall” orientation, mostly drilling, so it could be worth testing how aggressive I can get milling in that configuration.\n\nIts not buckling because of clamping force that you need to worry about. Its buckling due to tool pressure. If you have a 1\"x2\" tube with the 1\" dimension clamped in your fixture, the 2\" wall wants to cave in when you cut it. Your fixture is actually more prone to it since its only supported at the very bottom (and it wouldn’t surprise me that despite having a boatload of clamping force per miteebite cam clamp, you could actually tear the whole tube out/fold it over if you were too aggressive).\n\nYou can address this in a couple ways:\n\nConventional instead of climb cutting (virtually a must on thin wall tube like this) reduced axial depth of cut reduced radial width of cut reduced feedrate.",
