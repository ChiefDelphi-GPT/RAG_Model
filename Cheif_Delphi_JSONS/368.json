After discovering my financial capacity, I've narrowed down potential upgrades to either the Grizzly 10\" Slow-Speed Cold Saw or the Baileigh 9\" Cold Saw. My primary objectives are accuracy in cutting aluminum, minimal sparks for soft-steel cuts, a finished edge suitable for milling, reduced noise levels, and a sturdy clamping system that prevents bending during operation. Additionally, I aim for reliable angled mitre cuts. Based on research, a coolant-assisted system appears most promising, though I haven't used one before. While horizontal bandsaws weren't viable due to poor performance, I recognize the importance of a well-factored system. Questions remain about the effectiveness of the Grizzly and Baileigh models within our budget constraints.",

When you say you want something that can cut accurately, could you clarify how precise it needs to be? For instance, +/- 0.01 inches seems reasonable. If unsure, consider specifying use cases like 'for frame members that butt against each other.' A more detailed understanding might help identify a suitable solution. If your goals align with ours, then 'refacing on the mill'—such as a lathe—is likely part of your workflow, and the initial cutter choice might not significantly impact the outcome.",

The video series Evolution offers is highly recommended. Although Evolution saws offer various benefits and drawbacks, their primary limitation is excessive noise, particularly when cutting metal with metal blades, and especially when slicing through aluminum with steel blades. Claims about \"ragged\" cuts may stem from either cutting too quickly or using dull blades, as both factors accelerate wear. For accuracy, Evolution saws function similarly to cutoff saws or power miter boxes, relying on user skill in measurement and cutting. Mill work is generally the most precise method for obtaining accurate finishes. We recently acquired the Evolution S355 MCS mitre chop saw from Evolution, and it outperforms any other saw in our workshop. Experience shows that Grizzly tools are often underwhelming, prompting us to avoid them. Bandsaws are effective for tasks like preparing materials before milling but less suitable for precision work requiring accurate finishes.",

                    "cooked": "The Rage4 is a lightweight job site saw made for careful use by skilled tradesmen. It's not meant to handle heavy-duty tasks like cutting steel beams or powering machinery. Excessive force with the blade or improper clamping can lead to quick blade wear. The Rage4 usually uses a single blade per season, while more durable blades like the 12-inch fine-finish ones are worn out faster due to aggressive cutting methods, such as overloading the bearings, which cause teeth to break quickly once one fails. Switching to another saw within the same price range won't give better results when using similar techniques since each tool has unique features optimized for best performance. For instance, industrial-grade saws with heavier vises and advanced cooling systems, like the Evo dry saw or Harbor Freight lathe, are much better suited for demanding applications. However, if you're comfortable with basic maintenance and aren't opposed to a bit more wear and tear, upgrading to a machine like the LittleMachineShop mill could offer significant improvements in precision and efficiency compared to the Rage4 alone. Assess whether upgrading is necessary based on your specific needs and budget before making any major purchases. Prioritize acquiring reliable machines that match your skill level and workload requirements to maintain consistent quality and durability in your woodworking projects.",

                    "cooked": "The pursuit of precise saw cuts can often seem like a misguided endeavor, particularly in FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC). After completing a saw cut, consider the implications of your choice. Using pre-drilled tubing with only minor machining typically requires minimal precision, as a .100-inch tolerance is sufficient for achieving the correct number of holes. However, if subsequent processes involve welding, a higher degree of accuracy may be necessary depending on the quality of your fixtures. Nonetheless, even precise cuts can enhance aesthetics, making a nice miter saw a worthwhile investment, such as the Dewalt 12-inch model we prefer. Regular application of stick lube on aluminum ensures better performance, and always pay attention to your saw blade—if it slows down during operation, it might indicate that you're exerting too much force.",

                    "cooked": "Bandsaws are more versatile than mills, capable of cutting a variety of materials including tubing, unhardened shafts, and extruded components to size efficiently. They require occasional adjustment but can produce precise cuts with minimal effort, typically within +/- 1/8\" or 0.050\". These capabilities make them suitable for FIRST Robotics Competition work. However, for tougher materials, oversizing the bandsaw and finishing on a mill or lathe is recommended. If space constraints are an issue, it's wise to prioritize tool retention over the bandsaw. Additionally, for round stock, using a V-block allows stable clamping across three points, enhancing accuracy during operations.",

They're more of a horizontal bandsaw replacement for ferrous materials.\n\nWe were using my personal RAGE4 until upgrading to a Dewalt dw872 mounted to a SMW fixture table, now available from HaasBok Machining Workstations. This upgrade has been quite good. We use a variety of Strong Hand clamps and built a nice recessed table for the saw.\n\nAdditionally, the tool is very loud, though it cuts exceptionally well. When set up in our main work area, everyone needed to wear hearing protection and operators had to yell \"cutting\" before each cut to prevent startling others. Moving to a large back closet reduced noise significantly, and hanging moving blankets around the saw further mitigated the issue.",

                    "cooked": "A cold saw with coolant isn't recommended for typical FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) shops because they’re designed for longer structural shapes. These tools feature clamps suited for thicker metal pieces and require a high tooth count blade for thin materials—since a cold saw’s 1/8-inch blade is too thin. For metal-cutting applications, chop saws with carbide-tipped blades are better suited, especially those with lower RPM settings to reduce speed. These saws produce square cuts with finishes nearly as good as milling machines and are safer for student use compared to chop saws. Band saws with 3/4-inch blades are even safer, quieter, and capable of making straight, square cuts when properly aligned. They handle mild steel acceptably, though if more steel cutting is needed, bi-metal blades might be preferable. Additionally, using V-blocks ensures precise cuts for round shapes.",

                    "cooked": "Our team uses vertical band saws, which are pretty accurate. I can usually achieve a precision of within .0625’’ when cutting 2:1’’ aluminum tubes. Horizontal band saws are said to be less effective, and we experienced this firsthand. The blade tends to wobble slightly on horizontal saws compared to vertical ones. However, with vertical saws, you can attach the part to a plate and press it firmly against the blade manually. While it still wobbles, adjusting the position with your hands can minimize the movement, and tightening the blade slightly can further reduce wobble.\n\nUsing a vertical band saw allows you to avoid clamping the part, which reduces the time needed to cut a piece—for instance, I can cut a 1:2’’ aluminum tube in about 10 seconds. Though it may seem dangerous, it’s actually quite safe as long as your hand doesn’t slip into the blades. Some models come with additional safety features like protection rails, and these saws are generally quiet.\n\nOur smaller vertical band saw, though less powerful than larger models, is portable enough to travel to competitions where we plan to use it. Despite its size limitation, it performs well and can even cut steel screws efficiently—like a particular screw in under 3 seconds without any sparks.\n\nAfter cutting a piece, we often send it to a belt sander to smooth it to the desired finish. By cutting slightly longer than needed and sanding the excess, I’ve found that stacking two parts next to each other is nearly imperceptible to the naked eye. This method works especially well for small parts measuring up to 5 inches, with inaccuracies typically staying within half a millimeter.\n\nHowever, the accuracy of vertical band saws can vary significantly depending on the user’s experience. Our newer team members have had issues cutting parts that were 0.625’’ off, highlighting the importance of skill in achieving precise results.",

It cuts cleanly with minimal burrs and requires very little touch-ups to be functional. The clamp on our saw works well even with thinner materials and accommodates tubing just fine.\n\nI’ve noticed the noise it makes is significantly quieter than a high-speed chop saw. While it does cut slightly slower, we’re glad we inherited it from our middle school’s shop when they retired a lot of older tools. Additionally, we receive free coolant from a local machine shop either after using it or if there’s a little leftover concentrate they won’t use otherwise; this keeps us supplied for the entire season.\n\nIt’s a large, heavy saw, and fortunately, our shop is connected to the school’s Industrial Tech program, allowing us to store it there.",

It requires hearing protection and an \"EARS\" warning in the workshop due to its noise level. While its precision is typically within ±0.015 inches, on a 34-inch elevator tube, this level of accuracy is sufficient. What's more important is that all pieces are uniform in length, making it straightforward to verify their lengths.",
