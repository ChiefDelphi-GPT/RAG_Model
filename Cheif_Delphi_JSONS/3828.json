Are there any common issues that lead to higher voltage when moving down than up?\n\nAny insights would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance.",

                    "cooked": "We have a similar elevator with Falcon500s and TalonFXs, also using motion magic. It’s impossible to tell whether most of your k* constants make sense without knowing the units. But it seems reasonable to guess that kS is in volts and that seems quite high  to me as it says it takes almost 1/10 of the full-voltage output of two Krakens to move your elevator against friction.\n\nI’ll give you our numbers for comparison but you must take into accounts the units before any comparison will be useful. Note we have our ratios set, taking into account various gear and chainwheel sizes, so that control constants are directly in terms of meters kS = 0.04 volts kV = 1.9 volts/(meter/sec) kA = 0.08 volts/(meter/sec^2) kG = 0.44 volts kP = 38.2 kD = 1.55 (I don’t know off the top of my head whether the kP and kD are in terms of position error or velocity error for position motion magic so I didn’t give units for those).\n\nThe moving mass of the elevator is 4Kg. MM cruise velocity is 300cm/sec, and acceleration is 1500cm/sec^2.\n\nI was planning to confirm tonight that the cruise and acceleration targets are being achieved. But I can say that with this setup the elevator motion is fast enough to be unsettling in its speed and that it achieves its setpoints almost perfectly.\n\nThere is one other thing that we discovered that may be relevant. We have one motor commanded to act as a follower of the other (with inversion, of course). We discovered that if you issue a different command to the follower it stops following. So we had our stop method as m_leftMotor.set(0); m_rightMotor.set(0); the result was that the elevator would go fast the first time a MM setControl was given but after that it was much slower since the right motor had stopped following the left. Now for stop we just do m_leftMotor.setControl(m_neutralOut) where m_neutralOut is initialized to a NeutralOut control.\n\nBy the way, the feedforward and feedback constants were all determined using sysID on a simulation of the elevator. I am somewhat flabbergasted that this worked, but we have not seen any reason to change them given that they work so well.",
