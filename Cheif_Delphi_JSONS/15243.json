I’m wondering if anyone has found a way to upload one or more pipeline files to the limelight during robot operation.\n\nWe use revision control with our Robot code to ensure that the tested code is what we’re running.  I’d like to be certain that the pipelines we’ve tested are the pipelines uploaded without requiring a human to click through the limelight UI.\n\nI’d like to check in the pipeline files that we’re using and upload them to the limelight in Robot initialization.   That would even allow us to test a branch with pipeline changes and then when we switched to another branch, the new branch would use the expected pipeline files.\n\nI’ve not seen any way to do this in the Limelight API or documentation, but its definitely possible that I’ve missed it.  It feels like it is probably just a matter of doing the proper HTTP request , the same one that the Javascript code in the UI does.\n\nHas anyone done this?",

You can download the pipelines and upload them to the camera, but I don’t believe that there is a limelight/photonvision supported way to upload pipelines. However, you can duplicate your pipeline into another slot, test in that pipeline number, and then still have the original pipeline being used in the earlier. I’m not saying it’s definitely not possible, but I know the limelight and photonvision aren’t designed with a built-in way to do this. Maybe someone with more experience with raspberry pi’s can figure this out? One thing to note: you can connect to the limelight over ssh, but it requires a password that is not set by the team.\n\nOverall, the complexity probably isn’t worth it. You should probably just download/upload the pipelines in the UI. At best you are going to save yourself a couple of minutes every time you use substantially different pipelines; but doing this is going to take hours. It won’t save you any time.",
