On the localization side is the Limelight 4 worth it? how are its abilities, what about the Machine learning / object detection side?. We’ve also talked about using an Orange Pi with cameras using photon vision. Any teams who have used the NVIDIA Jetson how is it? Any controbutions to this discussion would be greatly appreciated, as right now im at crossroads trying to pick the direction i think we should venture in both vision and Object detection. Thank you for any assistance i greatly appreciate it",

The camera wires kept breaking, and we had a struggle powering it until Redux released their Zinc-V . This offseason, we’ve been testing a limelight 4, and it has been amazing. It really just works and has worked flawlessly so far. I don’t think Limelight has been any better than our previous system, but it has been so much easier to implement and test. I highly recommend it for that reason, even though it is expensive\n\nWe’ve even had success detecting coral with color thresholding on the Limelight, even with a black-and-white camera, and we’re eagerly awaiting the color camera upgrade.",

Fixing the camera wire is relatively easy, as well.\n\nJetson Nano is probably good, but it is not plug and play and requires you to do some stuff to get it to work, so we haven’t tried it",

(2nd  selections would be on Camera types, co-processors type - RPi4/RPi5 vs OPi5/others and # of co-processors + # of cameras).\n\nThere’s no single ‘right’ answers.  At the end of the day, what works really well for one team might not work for yours.  Know “yourself” (mentors/students skill/tech level and budget).",
