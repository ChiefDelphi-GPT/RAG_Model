                    "cooked": "This year, my team is using a bot that has a rotatable arm, and even with break-mode turned on on our Spark Maxes, we still get a little bit of drift in the arm because of the extensive weight. I know that similar functionality of holding the arm stationary can be reached through a PID Loop, so I have tried creating a PID Subsystem that can hold the arm stationary. In my main teleop command, I have it so that if the driver is not pushing down a button that lifts the arm, then the arm is held stationary. Competition is coming up, and I am having a lot of trouble getting this functionality integrated into our robot. I have attached my code below. When I run my useOutput() method in my teleop command, it does not work the way I intend it to. Could I get some help with getting this to work before my team goes to competition soon? When our motor drifts, the Spark Max velocity is about 45, so that is why I used 10 for my tolerance value. I used 0 for my setPoint because the value I am using is the arm motor velocity, so I want the setPoint to be 0 rotations. When I get the subsystem laid out properly, I would also love some guidance on how to work with the PIDSubsystem in my command to get the arm to be stationary. Thank you so much for your help! It means a lot!\n\nArmPID.java (2.3 KB)",
