This year we would also like to explore what Krakens have, especially the X44. However, our programmers are relatively inexperienced and we don’t know how majorly the change would affect them.\n\nHow different are the two systems? Is switching just as simple as changing a few lines of the code?\n\nIs there a way for us to experiment with using Krakens without purchasing Phoenix 6? (We have two unused krakens in our lab for some reason)\n\nAnd, in your opinion, which software system is easier to use?",

In general, our programmers far prefer the CTRE environment and we do use it both with motion profiling as well as integration with AdvantageKit. In fact, in 2024 (before X44 and Minion were released) we had a pair of NEO550s on the robot for some small mechanisms and they were nagging me constantly to switch them over to something that ran on CTRE code (which ultimately proved impractical at the time, but still).\n\nOn the hardware-side, we’ve been very happy with our experience with Krakens, and have had no major issues with them. The handful of issues we did have were resolved very quickly by their support team.\n\nAnd speaking of support, that’s one other thing I’ll add, CTRE has excellent support. Our programming team has spent many (productive) hours on the phone with them working out different issues and functions with our code and they’ve always been happy to help, even sometimes after normal business hours (you’d swear these guys never go home).",

Change the one setting you want then apply all of the settings again.\n\nThere may be better code to accomplish what we want and it would be cleaner and simpler code to set everything at once but we like to do one at a time to easily notice and redo if there are errors making a setting.",

For the 2026 season, we’re trying to see if we have the budget to move to 100% krakens. I can’t speak from a programming standpoint, but from a mechanical standpoint, krakens are 1000% the way to go. Packaging and placing them in the robot is SO much easier. No pesky motor controller or fragile encoder cables to worry about. We fried 5 neos this past season due to an encoder cable getting damaged. Krakens are overall far more robust, no need to worry about a machine key slipping out due to their spline shaft. It’s also MUCH harder to overheat a kraken. Not to mention that the overall performance of a kraken is objectively superior to a neo 1.1 or vortex.\n\nIf you can go kraken, do it.",

Overall I think for basic tasks they aren’t going to be too different difficulty wise, I think the more advanced you get programming wise the more ctre is gonna take the lead. On board PID and Motion profiling and the simulation stuff they have (Rev has this too but afaik ctre’s is better) can be really useful.\n\nObviously there will still definetely be a transition but nothing crazy.\n\nOr you could just switch to redux motors only ¯_(ツ)_/¯.",

I wasn’t extremely involved in the process of switching, but we did a staggered approach where we did a mix of Neos and Krakens in 2024 and switched to almost all Krakens (used falcons where Krakens weren’t really necessary). Also from what I’ve heard from my teams programmers, they find using Krakens much easier than using Neos for coding, but take that with a grain of salt because I’m not that familiar with how the switch went on the programming side.",

SplineXS has benefits over the keyed shaft of neos (even load, rather than transferring at the keyway), but in my opinion the biggest benefit of krakens is the wiring. The screw terminals are second to none, since you can make the wires the correct length each season without having an intermediary connector (failure point). In 2025 we had direct runs to all of our motors. The motor controller being integrated means you don’t need to find room to mount a separate controller. With 8 motors in a swerve chassis alone, it made a huge difference when we converted our 2024 robot with a 24” drive base from Neos to falcons. A lot of room on the belly pan was opened up",

Configuration over the network is occasionally useful, but not having an easy way to load firmware and configure CAN IDs directly from a laptop is really frustrating. With the SparkMax/Flex, we can configure every device before it’s even mounted on the robot (or have a replacement pre-configured when swapping in the pits). Needing to manually blink each device and deconflict CAN IDs once the devices are already mounted is not a fun experience, especially under time pressure…",
