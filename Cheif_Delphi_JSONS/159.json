We've been exploring improvements to our CAN setup and currently plan to employ two CANivores to separately manage the drivetrain and superstructure, ensuring the drivetrain remains operational and enabling defensive measures in case of a failure. Considering further redundancy, we considered implementing a Star topology, which involves maintaining the drivetrain in a daisy-chained configuration while introducing a hub on the superstructure bus to establish Star topology. However, given the potential complexities and risks associated with correctly setting up Star topology, we sought advice from our team on its feasibility, best practices, alternative topologies, and drawbacks.",

Star offers a lot of redundancy since a single failure won’t take down the whole network generally especially when moving parts are involved. The drivetrain is also the biggest drain on CAN network utilization so once you separate that out you can pretty much run everything else on CAN 2.0 with no issues.\n\nIn general my preference would be to run everything on Star if it weren’t for the limited bandwidth of the 2.0 network. Running both is more of a compromise solution than anything but it’s good enough if you’re smart about it. A team without a high CAN bus utilization on 2.0 could probably use Star for the whole robot with no issues we are just not one of those teams.\n\nThe Playing with Fusion boards are pretty similar to ours so you’d probably be fine going that way. Swyft also has an interesting solution for Daisy Chain CAN and power though I don’t know how much I trust RJ45 connectors.",

The primary reason why separating the drive motors on a swerve platform from the 2.0 network leads to significant performance improvements lies in the communication mechanism established by CTRE (Cross The Road Electronics). This environment facilitates effective interaction between swerve motors and sensors. However, when individual motors manage their own PID loops and functions independently, the overall network load remains manageable compared to the full network integration.\n\nIf you're experiencing challenges running more than four standalone Kraken systems on your 2.0 network, it may be worthwhile to reach out to CTRE’s support team. They are typically very helpful and could provide further insight into whether you're implementing the system correctly.",

However, adopting a more reliable approach, we exclusively use Kraken and CANcoders, constructing our own CAN segments between devices—cutting costs and minimizing solder connections (except on CANcoders and terminating resistors). Additionally, we favor jacketed wire for areas prone to being cut, though we all prefer to avoid cutting through the jacket to prevent nicks to the green/yellow wires.",

It is far more sensitive to star “abuse” than the rio’s native and slower can.\n\nWe used the canivore, and used a hybrid topology. This is what it looked like:\n\nThe small squares are what I’ll call a “hub”. It’s where we broke out the star from the trunk line.\n\nWe did have problems with the can bus on initial setup. We kept stub lengths as short as possible. What we found, however, was that when we had two stubs close together, say the intake and a swerve module, and the linear distance if you measured back to the canivore along the wires overlapped, we would have problems. This wasn’t surprising. As a result, when we had an issue like that, we would extend the wires between the hubs.\n\nThis is a picture of what I mean:\n\nOn the right in the above diagram, the Intake “star” is long enough that it’s length back to the canivore overlaps with a device on the swerve “star”. The fix to this was to extend the cable between the intake and swerve so the devices are a significantly different 'wire' distance from the canivore as those on another star.\n\nFollowing that worked. However…\n\nTake this all with a giant grain of salt. It took us a couple tries to get the lengths correct as we worked through the bus. And I was worried about the 'what if it fails' all season. At one point, we made a minor change to one of the stars during practice and it took the bus down until we lengthened another cable. It can be tricky, and you can spend a lot of time diagnosing a problem that you really shouldn’t be wasting time on.\n\nDaisy chaining is the simple, reliable answer to the question “how should I run my can bus wiring?” Just ask yourself “Do I want to be programming the robot, or troubleshooting my can bus?”",

Either topology, if poorly implemented, will perform poorly. By improving procedures for electrical connections, you can enhance the reliability of your control system and robot. Ensure your team performs a tug-test on each wire immediately after making the connection. Ensure connectors cannot come apart and use a small zip-tie for the black PWM connectors supplied with SparkMax. Strain-relieved wires on both sides of connectors prevent tension during movement. Avoid tension on wires, especially at connection points. Include a service loop at each connector to allow movement without transferring force and enable easier servicing. These practices are commonly used in industry.",
