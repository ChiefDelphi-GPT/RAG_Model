                    "cooked": "One of the main reasons Vector has been able to do so well this year was because of our robot’s straightforward design. Simplicity in the design meant that issues were, for the most part, easily diagnosable and fixable, allowing for shorter repair times and more practice time. However, one issue has plagued our team since worlds, leaving us stumped.\n\nFor whatever reason, our Andymark Climber in a Box’s Dyneema would catch on itself while spooling. The Dyneema would somehow double spool and pinch itself while winching, preventing us from climbing any higher than the midbar. At worst, it was happening almost every single climb, but we could never recreate it in the pits. The issue started around champs, and we haven’t been able to find a proper solution since then.\n\nFor our recent off-season competition, Robot Remix, we decided to try switching away from Dyneema. The most obvious replacement was a 1\" ratchet strap, as it would eliminate any inconsistent spooling while being strong enough to climb. We designed a custom spool that slips onto the thunderhex shaft, and can be 3d-printed. It uses two cross bars to catch and pull the ratchet strap’s loop. For reference, think of the 2020 everybot climber spool mechanism. winch 3024×4032 427 KB 3d printed winch 1904×1410 59.5 KB\n\nwinch 3024×4032 427 KB\n\nwinch 3024×4032 427 KB\n\n3d printed winch 1904×1410 59.5 KB\n\n3d printed winch 1904×1410 59.5 KB\n\nBenefits: -climber’s heights relative to each other remains more consistent than with Dyneema -impossible to have winching issues since the winch is the same width as the strap -more consistent winching speed as diameter remains the same throughout the entire spool -customizable spool\n\nDownsides: -custom spool needed -ratchet straps have to be cut to the right length, and loops have to be stitched using heavy-duty thread\n\nThe ratchet strap system immediately worked with no issues, and our drivers managed to get a few decently fast climbs without any spooling issues. At Robot Remix, we managed to climb every single time with zero issues.\n\nMy only regret is that we didn’t do this sooner.",

It can work really well, but does have one downside - the effective diameter of your spool changes as you run the mechanism.  The more the strap wraps around it, the thicker it gets.  And with that change you impact the speed and the force of your mechanism.  Not an insurmountable obstacle, but one you need to consider when pairing it with a motor/gearbox!  It would be very easy to design it such that it stalls halfway down as the effective diameter increases to a point where you don’t have enough force to continue lifting.",

While we had a fairlead to bring the strap towards the middle of the shaft, once the wraps got going, it wrapped up into a neat cylinder rather than the not-so-level-wind you get from round cord.  I suspect this is something of a crown pulley effect, where slipping a bit to one side tends to pull things back to center.  The bottom line is that you may not need flanges on that pulley other than to support the cross bars.",
