                    "cooked": "Hi all, In the past day I’ve come across many issues related to making a method that takes to long and overrunning the Command Scheduler’s loop.  When this only happens a few times, we don’t get any issues, but when it starts happening a lot, I believe we start getting the 'Watchdog Not Fed\" message in driver station and the robot crashes.  I’ve read up on what can cause this, and our code has no while() or even for() loops, no constantly updated data in SmartDashboard, and, as of now, no more print statements.  However, we are still getting the “Command Scheduler Loop Overrun” message every so often.  I’ve experimented, and I have noticed that resetting the odometry is an action that, by itself, exceeds the 0.02-second time limit and overruns the scheduler.  However, other actions are not so easy to pinpoint.  Sometimes the method that took too much time is a command.initialize() or command.execute() , but other times it is the buttons.run() call.  This is especially strange. Does anyone know how to fix this?  If it would be helpful in giving an answer, I will post my project. Thanks for the help!",

We essentially used the HID object (for both drive and operator control) for every single poll of the xbox controller (including dPad/POV) and it solved the problem on our side. (see example below)\n\nParaduks:\n\nSometimes the method that took too much time is a command.initialize() or command.execute()\n\nIt would be hard to pinpoint this problem since it may just be a specific problem with your code, so you would need to post your project.\n\nParaduks:\n\nI’ve read up on what can cause this\n\nI believe this issue is caused by the fact that you are essentially setting up a new trigger event but rather than waiting for it to be fired you are directly calling its value therefore creating a new event/trigger every iteration of your robot which is bad practice altogether and as a result severely clogs up robot system resources.\n\nI believe this issue is caused by the fact that you are essentially setting up a new trigger event but rather than waiting for it to be fired you are directly calling its value therefore creating a new event/trigger every iteration of your robot which is bad practice altogether and as a result severely clogs up robot system resources.\n\nProper explaination\n\nCommand Scheduler Loop Overrun Causes and Remedies Technical\n\nHope this helps",

It is calling the Trigger factories every loop . In addition to the GC pressure from so many objects, there’s also an issue with the implementation that causes loop overruns when these factories are called so many times. (This issue will be fixed for 2025.)\n\nTo illustrate the point:\n\nHere, the problematic function is x – there is no problem using getAsBoolean ! Caching the Trigger object, like the following, solves the issue:\n\nAdditionally, Trigger s are BooleanSupplier s, so there is only harm in this common use pattern:\n\nThis achieves the same result, without causing issues:\n\nI hope I cleared up some confusion.",

I was able to fix it doing what @arshan and @Starlight220 recommend and, instead of getting the button trigger object by calling controller.a() , getting it by writing new Trigger(() -> controller.getHID().getA()) .  Hopefully WPILib fixes this for next year, the way I was doing it seems to be the obvious way of using their library, but, for now, this is a fine workaround.",
