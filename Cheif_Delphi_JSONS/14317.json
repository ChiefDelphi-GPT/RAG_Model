                    "cooked": "So I was watching worlds yesterday and today and I was amazed by some of the shooters at worlds that were able to shoot so consistently and so fast once they picked up a ball. For our team it took us at least 1 to 2 seconds to oscillate to the right speed and then once we reached that speed only then could we shoot. I was wondering if knew how these teams were able to reach the speeds so fast and then were able to shoot the ball with almost little to no error. Also does anybody know any teams with a public repository for code that can shoot almost immediately after picking up a ball. I’ve looked at a lot of the teams but most of there code is pretty complex so I was just wondering if anybody knew any teams that could shoot fast and had pretty simple code to understand.\n\nThanks for the help!",

If you get your feed-forward tuned just perfectly (while using voltage compensation !), you should use a small amount of P gain and see no oscillations. Once we got ours tuned well we could expect to get up to stable speed in 2-3 tenths of a second (we had a relatively light flywheel for how much power we had though).",

One spool up plus full match for a high inertia flywheel is going to be less energy than maybe 3-4 spool ups.  It was really a shocking amount of energy for our system.  One other detail: idle at your minimum shooting speed…  That way you don’t have to brake to get down for the close shot!\n\nFor our dual 6\" Fairlane shooter, 2 NEOs, 0.75 step down ratio, 2100 RPM idling speed, that 179 Joules.  Our idling current was only 0.1 Amps per NEO.  So, idling for 3 minutes costs you 180 Joules (0.2 Amps * 12 Volts * 3 minutes * 60 seconds/minute).  Spool up and hold for the match is 359 Joules of energy.  So, 2 spool ups is the same energy cost as spool and hold!\n\nFor a lower inertia flywheel this calculation may come out differently!  Also, you might find that the gyroscopic action of the flywheel might mess with a turret or maybe turning the robot fast.",

The TalonFX can’t send the motor more voltage than your battery has to offer, so voltage compensation works by slowing you down a tad on a full battery in the name of consistency.",

                    "cooked": "Question to further this discussion because it’s something I’ve long wondered, but a bit long-winded (either that or I just have a way of making everything I say long-winded ). The thread title is pretty general so the more useful it is for future lookers the better.\n\nSetting up a shooter to function at a fixed speed is pretty straightforward forward all things considered, even once you consider PID and other fancy features for keeping the shooter wheel at speed and consistent.\n\nWhat I want to know is more related to characterizing your shooter such that speed & hood angle can be adjusted based on distance, movement direction (since we live in the age of swerving and shooting while moving now), etc.\n\nNow I’m an engineering student so 3 methods come to mind, but looking at how consistent top-tier teams are with shooting, I can’t envision those methods being that level of foolproof but I’d love to be wrong.\n\nDynamics (spicy physics) Characterisation: you use dynamics to write a function that takes in the distance, height, and other world parameters you can measure that define where your target is and spits out the RPM needed. This is relatively simple since my algebra skills are no longer limited by my 3-hour exam window, and asking some of my profs how they would tackle a problem like this, this is what they swear by. But raw physics is only as accurate as the assumptions you’ve made and with the level of shooter consistency we see year after year with top tier teams, something tells me this can’t be the only thing going on, especially once things like backspin, and slipping along the hood are in play. You could try to account for them by using coefficients that you tune in later but that seems really tedious.\n\nDynamics (spicy physics) Characterisation: you use dynamics to write a function that takes in the distance, height, and other world parameters you can measure that define where your target is and spits out the RPM needed.

Using a table with location ( XY or any other pair of variables [r & theta comes to mind for this actually]) on the row and column of the table at specified intervals, you can manually set output parameters that correspond to each location via trial and error. Then on the field, the code can interpolate between boxes to shoot “anywhere”. This seems really plausible to me assuming you have a good way to take in the parameters and get more accurate the more fine the intervals between your boxes are, and you don’t actually need to do any fancy physics either. However, Unless you want to get into the world of double, or even triple interpolation, trying to do this for shooting on the move seems like a nightmare.\n\nLook-up Table: This is how I would do this if you told me to get this set up today.

I assume for the average team, this is likely what happens, and you end up with a shooter that works really well in a location or to but is meh at best everywhere else. You can probably try to make the shooter speed and hood angle just a simple function of distance and height, and if you have the ability to swerve or a turret, you can just try offsets based on the heading. This is jank and probably won’t work very well but I have seen it attempted and work well enough for teams who have decided they only really need a few places to shoot from well.\n\nTurn it into a simple function and tune coefficients based on trial and error.

The nice thing about the table is that tweaking behavior at a specific distance from the hub is simple to understand and to carry out without breaking anything else. We didn’t attempt shooting on the move though so I can’t speak to how we’d have adapted it. Maybe for Chezy if we get in and the team is feeling motivated\n\nFor IR@H we had taken samples and derived a continuous function, but with a static flywheel speed it was simpler to do so.",
