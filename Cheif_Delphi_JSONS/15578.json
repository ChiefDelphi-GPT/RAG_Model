                    "cooked": "Hey Everyone,\n\nRelatively new to training PIDs and working on an arm pid following the Talon’s motion magic guide:\n\nPrimer on Closed-loop: Talon SRX and Victor SPX supports a variety of closed-loop modes including position closed-loop, velocity closed-loop, Motion Profiling, and Motion Magic. Talon SRX additiona...\n\nThe arm works relatively well (I can get within 10 degrees of target position), however I feel like it could be better, so I wanted to go through my process.\n\nIn my case, we chose to had the arm being completely horizontal be 0 ticks on the encoder. Following the tutorial guidance, we set up the coefficient to basically make encoder ticks a 1 to 1 with degrees. So when the encoder position reads 90, the arm is at the top of the circle sticking straight up in the air. Encoder Position is 0 and 180 at the horizontal positions.\n\nWhen it comes to tuning the maximum gravity feed forward, following the guide I found that I needed to run the motor at 20% to be able to hold the 0 horizontal position. So I chose to use a maximumGravityFeedForward of .20. Which with my understanding the cos(0) will be 1, meaning it will maximize the gravityFeedForward at the horizontal positions.\n\nkf Here is where my understanding of PID is fuzzy. First for setting the KF, from my understanding this would be the maximum speed the PID loop would be allowed to run at.\n\nI found that 30% motor output was a good speed.  Using the scaled values, I found the encoder was moving at 7 units per 100ms. This is obviously the scaled value which tries to be 1 to 1 to degrees. Now thinking about it, I wonder if I should be using native units for this value. But anyways, using that math:\n\n(30% * 1023) / (7) = 43.8428571429 kF\n\nkp Next is kP. From my understanding, this is what we allow the loop to respond to the error.  In this case I used 20% which is 3 units/100ms\n\n(20% * 1023) / (3) = 68.2 kP\n\nDoes my understanding of this process make sense? I feel like I am doing something wrong, I wanted to run it by people here who have a much better understanding of how this works. I haven’t even begun to change kD and kI yet, as from my understanding kD to resolve overshoot and for kI to help smooth",

This is an especially poor approach for controlling a mechanism whose feedforward dynamics are nonlinear (like an arm that has a cosine-dependent force acting on it at all times).\n\nConsider instead characterizing your arm with SysId (or computing the relevant gains theoretically from the design) and using WPILib’s ArmFeedforward class.\n\nPlumbing this into MotionMagic may prove not-very-ergonomic (I’ve done it in the past - it was possible but not fun), so I’d also recommend abandoning MotionMagic entirely and just generating your profiles on the RIO .",

Feels odd to have a value greater than 0\n\nBoth of those values seem high.\n\nKeep in mind that any time you’re using speed in your calculations (such as for kF) you should use the raw native units, not the value that’s scaled to degrees.\n\nI would recommend the following for using Motion Magic with your arm:\n\nDetermine you arbitrary feed-forward first, before calculating any of your gains.  Use just percent output mode + arbitrary feed-forward to make sure you can control your arm with a joystick and have it stay at position as expected.  This will validate that your gravity compensation from feed-forward is working.\n\nThen start tuning your gains, beginning with kF as the velocity feed-forward, making sure to use raw native units in your calculations.\n\nIt is possible that your gains may end up greater than 1, it just depends on the arm system.\n\njoemost:\n\nWas there any example of that arm with gravity in your repo anywhere?\n\nIt doesn’t look like there is one in the examples repo - most of the examples are drivetrain based.\n\nI’ll also add that when motion magic was released there was no WPI functionality for an automatic trapezoidal profile or (if I recall correctly, I could be wrong) feed-forward classes - there’s a lot of cool functionality that’s been added in the last couple of years.  Using the WPI features is completely viable if you choose.\n\nI think that you should be able to get up and running with motion magic fairly quickly using what I outlined above, just keep your units in mind.

One last question…\n\nWhen finding that arbitrary feedforward, I found there were values that would ‘hold’ the arm at the horizontal, but I needed a greater value to allow the arm to rotate through.\n\nI was basically taking the absolute minimum percent output, which was 20%, if at 0 degrees (horizontal) it would hold there. However if at 90 degrees (straight up), 20% would have no issues rotating. I guess to your point I should be passing in cos(90) which should be 0 and have no feed forward there.\n\nI guess I was just currious if you thinking of finding my arbitary feed-forward was correct. 1. in your answer configured me a little bit. There isn’t a value in percent output mode that’ll hold my arm (my arm rotates around a shoulder).\n\nI’ve seen more overshoot issues with the arm going beyond 90 degrees as well, as its now moving downward. I wonder if I should have any feed forward at all there.",

If you’re using a motor that has a low thermal mass, it may be worth looking at mechanical solutions, such as increased gearing or counterbalancing.",

I’m stuck on how to get values for kSV, sGV, kVVoltSecondPerRad, and kAVoltSecondSquaredPerRad. Do I use SysID? That’s a problem because I don’t have a robot with an arm on it yet. Secondly, how do I avoid SysID breaking my robot? If I was writing my own arm testing code, I’d put in safe parameters and limits. Not having any visibility into what arm code SysID is going to run scares me. Looking at the SysID code, I did see there’s arm simulation code in there. Maybe that’s how SysID characterizes arms?\n\nI started down the road of creating my own arm simulation, starting with the WPILib example. This is super cool. Can I use this to tune ArmFeedForward? I’m not even sure how to go about this in a systematic way. I’m having thoughts about using ML techniques like gradient decent to an optimal solution.\n\nI feel like I’m missing some critical element here.",
