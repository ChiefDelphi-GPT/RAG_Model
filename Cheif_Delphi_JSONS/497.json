It was bought new and only used for the competition.  So, relatively few cycles on it.  I ran it through 18 discharge cycles at 12 Amps (maximum for the tester I have on hand) and 11 Volt cutoff.  Note that most of 5892’s testing is done at 10.5 Volt cutoff, but I chose this to minimize the impact of this scale of testing on the capacity of the battery.\n\nThere’s two data points that are oddly low.  I really don’t know what’s up there!  Other than that, there is a small downward trend across the testing, but its only 1.3% on the curve fit (with the two outliers removed)\n\nI have just started testing a brand new Expert Power battery from Amazon, but I thought summer CD would be interested in seeing the testing results from a significant campaign",

Amazon.com: ExpertPower EXP12180 12V 18Ah Lead Acid Battery : Health & Household EXP12180 12V 18Ah Lead Acid Battery\n\nAll testing was done at 12 Amp constant current, 11 Volt cutoff point. Internal resistance includes 6AWG cable and Anderson SB50 connector.  I used a FNIRSI Internal Resistance Voltage Tester, HRM-10.  I fabricated a custom wiring harness with Kelvin connections soldered into the Anderson SB50 pins.\n\nAs we have been led to believe, the battery capacity increased.  The first cycle added 2,230 mAhrs!  The second added another 226 mAhr.  After that the battery’s capacity dropped by 170 mAhrs per cycle, pretty evenly (I did a curve fit taking out the first data point). I’m kind of surprised that I didn’t see this level of steady degradation on the MK battery; this one lost 11 mAhrs per cycle.\n\nBased on this, I’m leaning away from buying more of these batteries…\n\nOn the break in cycle, it looks like one load cycle does most of it.  Unfortunately I don’t have data on break in current vs battery capacity.\n\nMaybe next season I will ask my electrical crew to pull this type of data!",

Ambient temperature may also cause some variation in the measured battery capacity.\n\nWe did a bunch of testing of our chargers last fall using the same battery capacity tester that you lent to us and that you are likely using for these tests.  In some of these tests, we charged a battery on the same charging port of a particular 3-port charger. The battery was charged at least overnight since we were at the STEM Center only 3x each week. The same test was done with a second battery on a different brand of 3-port charger. We saw only around 2% variation in the battery capacity for each of the two batteries.\n\nThese tests were all done at our STEM Center where the temperature variation is relatively small over time.",
