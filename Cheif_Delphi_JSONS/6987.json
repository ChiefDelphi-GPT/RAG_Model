I’ve been on the team for 2 years and seen 2 arms on the past 2 editions of our robot, and from what we found this year, it doesn’t work as well as we hoped it to be. From what I have been told, we’ve tried many things such as linear actuators, chain drive, belts, both or pivot points (what we did this year). For this year’s competion, we used a neo 500, a 90 degree gearbox, and a hex shaft with a chain drive to move the arm.\n\nWhat we eventually realized was that our approach was wrong, and we did not correctly consider the forces the arm would have to go through, which really hurt our competitiveness this season. This is something we are currently trying to solve, but after a few days of discussion, we are stuck in a dilemma.\n\nMy question to all of you is, what are the physics and calculations behind a well-engineered arm, and how did you make it work, such as the parts you have used on your successful arm designs and power limits you implemented?",

                    "cooked": "Stiffness. A lot of bad arms are bad due to a lack of stiffness. If you know about those robots which have arms that flop around so much that their drivers are constantly fighting them, that’s one of the biggest things to avoid.\n\nStiffness issues come in two forms really, both true lack of stiffness and backlash. Backlash comes from most forms of mechanical power transmission and can be reduced by properly tensioning belts and chains, using a large sproket or sector gear for the final reduction, and shimming hex/hex interfaces. General excessive play in any of the joints can also cause undesired backlash-like behaviors, and are often the cause of stiffness issues.\n\nThe arm materials itelf can also deflect and cause stiffness issues. Using live-hex near the output will turn the entire shaft into a giant torsion spring which why they are generally avoided on arms. Some flat arm geometries also are suspectible to bending due to having a low second moment area . Flat arms such as ones with two side by side 1x1 tubes will be suspectible to deflection due to bending. Using larger diameter tubes, or offsetting the tubes vertically will significantly improve the bending stifness.\n\nFrom seeing 4627’s matches, there appears to be stiffness issues coming from the pivot point. I can’t see the bot up close to tell exactly what is is, but there appears to be issues there.\n\nAdditionally, the motors look extremely underpowerd. It could either be a gearing issue or a feedback/feedforward issue. The arm looks to be relying on the counterinsurgency to move up at all, which can case oscillatory behavior due to the system behaving like a spring-mass-damper rather than a system controlled by a motor. Most motors used in FRC these days should be strong enough to be able to lift the arm quickly without countersprining (while using countersprining is fine, the motor should still be the most significant thing controlling the system dynamics).",

You also probably want to get some sort of higher torque output using some sort of planetary gearbox(something like a regular Neo motor, a falcon500, kraken etc…\n\nWhen figuring out which gearbox ratio to use, I try to go to ReCalc and figuring out how much weight I’m pivoting, and then entering in COTS ratios from things like the MaxPlanetary or a Rotation SS Gearbox (love this gearbox).\n\nI like the chain drive, not so much the hex-shaft. Hex axles love to twist/deform in some way or the other, and I would check out what OA teams did this year. Personally, I did a system like this: image 951×530 140 KB The sprocket bolts to the tube, the tube sits on top of bushings , and the tube remains still (this is known as a dead-axle setup that is shown in the thread I linked).\n\nimage 951×530 140 KB\n\nimage 951×530 140 KB\n\nThe dead axle seats into a slot in the plate(like shown underneath) so that the loads from the axle go into the plate instead of the bolts from the tube nut . : image 797×574 94.9 KB Something I would have done differently is run two chain runs on each side, as we saw a ton of floppiness in our pivot, as well as one side of the shooter would significantly sag.\n\nimage 797×574 94.9 KB\n\nimage 797×574 94.9 KB",
