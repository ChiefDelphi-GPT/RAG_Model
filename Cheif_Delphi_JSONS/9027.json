Do you find that you need the helical grove to manage the cable?\n\nedit: yeah, the mass of a person on the timing belt forces the belt teeth to deform and slip. Add another belt, or a wider one, and that will go away. Not sure what happens to mass with two timing belts vs chain though.\n\nWe don’t know the forces required yet on the brake cable - it’s to move what is basically a wrist. (double roller intake with horizonal axles - not that much different than was was popular last year for both cones and cubes), but we need to change the pitch angle of that wrist between ground pickup, “hold” and amp / trap deposit.\n\nWe don’t think it’s much force though, but we will see.",

Any slack in the brake cable causes it to jump off of the drum and potentially kink the cable.\n\nOur testing seems to indicate that constant tension in the system is very necessary, which is congruent with how bike brakes typically work (the brake lever’s torsion spring counterbalances the torsion spring on the brake caliper). We only have torsion springs on one end of our system, and have had promising results from limiting the possible range of travel to keep the cable on the drum. Our NEO550 is set to coast and has a very low current limit. Putting it in brake mode led to inconsistent ability of the torsion spring to return the system to the original state.\n\nAnother solution could be to build in a torsion spring on the drum/actuator end of the system, but that was a level of complexity we weren’t ready to delve into yet.",

Not much applied current, but yes, the Neo550 would need to be in brake mode basically all the time when it’s not pulling, so temperature management.\n\nI don’t know if we have any really big servos that could do the job, as we can just increase the pulley OD a bit and keep the total throw under a servo.",
