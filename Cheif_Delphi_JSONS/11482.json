                    "cooked": "We here on Team 48 decided to design and build a turret for a ball-shooting mechanism for our 25th anniversary robot, xtremachen25 .  This was the first time we ever put such a thing our our bot.  Better late than never, right?  We also did not like the right-angle COTS packaging options for climber gearboxes to pair with our dual AndyMark Climbers In a Box (which both worked just fine #ad ).  Add to this our obsession, for once in our existence, to have a robot weigh significantly south of the weight limit and our possession of 2 Markforged printers, and we said “Why not?  Let’s have some fun!”\n\nSo we went a bit Onyx crazy.  Here is what resulted.  The herringbone gear pattern you see in the turret and climber gearbox were employed with reliable success at Finger Lakes.  Additionally, the robot weighs around 118 pounds, which it turns out is plenty enough to add our 2nd set of hooks for higher rung climbs, along with a few other mods.\n\nTeam 48 2022 Herringbone Turret Drive 1800×4000 1.37 MB Team 48 2022 Climber Gearbox 2160×3840 393 KB\n\nTeam 48 2022 Herringbone Turret Drive 1800×4000 1.37 MB\n\nTeam 48 2022 Herringbone Turret Drive 1800×4000 1.37 MB\n\nTeam 48 2022 Climber Gearbox 2160×3840 393 KB\n\nTeam 48 2022 Climber Gearbox 2160×3840 393 KB\n\nHere’s a Behind the Glass video of one of our qualifying matches where you can see the turret and climber in operation: https://youtu.be/Wh8XLmzMAYA?t=74\n\nWe had a lot of new things and new people to get up to speed at our first event, and competition results didn’t end up the way we would have liked, but we are excited for the potential of this robot and drive team.  We’re back in the shop tomorrow to begin upgrades and further practice.  I am very much Looking Forward to competing at the Buckeye and Midwest Regionals to see what we can achieve following some iteration time.",

Our only major maintenance requirement so far was to swap out the locking gear our metal climb lock dowels press into.  We observed some wear there.  We could probably just clock the gear 180 degrees and use it again, but why risk it?\n\nThe carbon fiber rod secondary climb hooks can be added to the “things with lots of 3D printed parts that scare me” category.  The upper hook clamp and the lower clamping pivot bracket are reinforced Onyx.  I believe at FLR, I weighed both hook assemblies (at the time without actuation cylinders) at 1.7 lbs. total.\n\nAll hook pivots have been coupled to the main frame via beefy reinforced Onyx brackets this entire season - the OG brackets are still on there and rock solid.  That continues to boggle my mind, especially after some of our more “interesting” prior climbs.  But these light 3D printed systems are slowly convincing me to trust their use in higher-load applications.\n\nIn other news, we also added something to our shooter (visible in the video) that makes it behave much better (famous last words).",
