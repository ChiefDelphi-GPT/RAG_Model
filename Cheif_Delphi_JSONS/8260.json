A trick we’ve used on 1706 is getting it to where it is able to slide in, and if it’s still tight you can hold the extrusion with the block in it up to a light. Anywhere you can see light past the block is good and you need to sand/file down where there is no light passing through. (Like a light based feeler gauge)\n\nThe blocks should eventually be at a point where you can put them in the top and they slide out the bottom. Especially with this year’s climb not putting a lot of bending on most climbers it’s not as critical the blocks are precise, then of course don’t over tighten and strain the tube out of square at the top when mounting the top aluminum blocks.",
