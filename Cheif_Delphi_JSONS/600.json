This can be about the library itself, tools, or documentation.\n\nI like to structure this kind of feedback ask as looking for the good, the bad, and the ugly:\n\nThe good (this was awesome, please keep doing it) : What worked well? What did you find particularly beneficial to your team? What would you like to see more of?\n\nThe bad (don’t repeat this, please figure out how to improve it ): What didn’t work? What did you struggle with? What would you like to see changed?\n\nThe ugly (worse than bad, please aim to never let this happen again) : What did you have to hack around to make it work for you? What made figuring out the right solution more difficult for you (e.g. wasted precious time)?\n\n( Other feedback structures such as Start/Stop/Continue or Thorns/Roses/Buds are also welcome–whatever works for you!)\n\nWe’re currently very actively working on changes for the 2027 control system to support both FTC and FRC on SystemCore (see the recent conference charts from the 2025 championship for a high level overview, and our 2027 project board on GitHub and associated PRs/issues for more details).  Given the large amount of development effort required for 2027, it’s likely 2026 will have a reduced number of changes compared to a normal year.  Suggestions are certainly welcome, but I’ll note that since WPILib is an all-volunteer effort / community project, the best way to see a feature get implemented is to implement it yourself, or get someone in the community interested in implementing it. We welcome both ideas and contributors!",

                    "cooked": "Good: the documentation continues to be excellent and ahead of what I find many of the commercially vended software offerings that we pay 6 figures per year for. (I said that before , but IMO it’s worth repeating; even as I know this is a genuine call for feedback and not fishing for compliments, compliments and thanks from the community are well-earned.)\n\nGood: the incorporation of more tools (specifically thinking of Elastic, which I think you bundled this season for the first time) was also good. Very convenient and aids in discovery of these tools, particularly for teams who will do the bare minimum of online participation and won’t see anything on CD .\n\nMiddle: It took us longer than I would have anticipated to port our code from 2024 to 2025. I wasn’t the programming mentor this year, so I don’t have the details, but it was several full meetings before we had last year’s code running on this year’s dev bot (and I think only an hour of that was firmware updates [outside of WPILib’s scope, of course] but was “something” and I’m sorry I can’t be more specific than that).\n\nBad-ish: I think there’s an opportunity to add some standard telemetry that could help teams. In particular, we failed in a couple of matches from out of memory errors on a Rio 1. There was probably something that we should have been exposing and monitoring all along that may have pointed us towards that risk that we ended up tripping over in a competition when we implemented a few more advanced auto routines. (This isn’t WPILib’s fault, of course, but is something that could be improved for other teams via standardization/codification of existing best practices. I can imagine a non-robot program that runs on the Rio and checks configuration items. I can also imagine a function in the robot program “WPILibStandardTelemetryEnable(true);” that turns that on.)\n\nGood: The AndyMark vs Welded field thing was annoying to have land in a minor version upgrade, but you guys did I think the best you possibly could there, so I’ll put it in the Good column as you, like us, were victims here.\n\nBad, but headed towards Good: We’re looking forward to the change you discussed here to clean up a very confusing API.",

It is simple to understand and get started, but it is also flexible that we were able to run commands in parallel in different ways to optimize our robot and squeeze out every ms to get to 4 cycle auton.\n\nSimulation is great . Also loved the driver station integration to run practice mode, but it would be great if the sim GUI also has a practice mode\n\nThe new VS code vendor dependency tab is great . Makes updating vender dependency easier\n\nThe bad (don’t repeat this, please figure out how to improve it ): What didn’t work? What did you struggle with?

Like many teams, we are constantly experiencing loop overrun, which seems to be coming from the SmartDashboard.udpateValue() method\n\nimage 1059×571 290 KB\n\nimage 1059×571 290 KB\n\nimage 1059×571 290 KB\n\nWe’ve minimized our use of SmartDashboard to just 1) Command Scheduler (to log current running commands), 2) Mechanism2d (to visualize the robot), 3) some commands (to trigger command in driver dashboard), 4) autonomous chooser, which helped with loop overrun, but it is just happening every few seconds. image 1620×762 73.2 KB\n\nimage 1620×762 73.2 KB\n\nimage 1620×762 73.2 KB\n\nSimulation GUI is sometimes buggy . Specifically the System Joystick window would often not show up, and there is no way to close it and reopen it with it greyed out in the menu\n\nUpdating apps that are bundled with WPILib is not ideal . Mainly advantage scope and elastic. There would be many times where advantage scope or elastic would push out a critical update, and we would have to decide whether it is critical enough to download advantage scope/elastic by itself, and make sure students don’t open the WPILib version of the app because there would be two advantage scope and elastic apps on the laptops. Maybe a way to uninstall the WPILib version of advantage scope and elastic?\n\nThe ugly (worse than bad, please aim to never let this happen again) : What did you have to hack around to make it work for you? What made figuring out the right solution more difficult for you (e.g. wasted precious time)?\n\nNothing I could think of. Thank you everyone who contributes to WPILib!",

                    "cooked": "There’s really nothing bad , per se.  WPILib is an amazing framework, and it keeps getting better every year.  I was pleased to see Thad was recognized with a volunteer of the year award.  The WPILib community deserves recognition.\n\nOne little minor nitpick that came up several times this season is that we have inline command factory functions for startRun , startEnd , and runEnd but we don’t have one for startRunEnd and there were a few times it would’ve been useful.\n\nI know there’s an AprilTag map inside WPILib.  I was wondering… are there other field parameters like Center of Field position (x, y in meters) and/or field length and width dimensions in meters?  There probably is and I missed it.  Similarly, the ability to mirror a point to the other alliance (rotate 180 about the center) or flip a point to the other side of the field on your own side would be useful.\n\nI would also love it if the robot pose objects could be able to give me both absolute heading (relative to the blue alliance always) and a heading relative to my own alliance.\n\nI borrowed some code that let us set the watchdog/loop overrun timer to a higher value, but it had to use reflection.  I think this should be configurable through the regular API.\n\nAlso, I know this isn’t specifically WPILib, but the CTRE device logging automatically enables when it detects that it’s connected to the field, and if you have a lot of CTRE devices (like we did) then you actually incur a significant CPU penalty.  I don’t mind if it’s enabled by default, but I don’t think it should exhibit a different behavior when connected to the field.  It didn’t follow the principle of lease surprise.\n\nI have to point out how good the documentation has become.  It’s excellent.",

                    "cooked": "Good : I really enjoyed using the Java Units this year. I had no unit-related bugs this year, compared to 2-3 last year. I also really love the dependency manager. It has been so much harder in previous years to manage dependencies, and the one-click easy imports result in easy updates and adding dependencies just to experiment around a bit. I also really liked using the geometry classes like Pose2d, Rotation2d, and Translation2d. I also enjoyed the deleteOldFiles config to remove out-of-date deployed files (this is not talked about enough, IMO). Not directly helpful to WPILIB, but the new VH radio was SO MUCH EASIER to program and flash than the previous radio (especially at comps).\n\nBad : I wonder if it would be possible to make Pose2d and similar geometry-based classes use Java Units as well. I think this could prevent some issues, but I am unsure of how simple it would be. I wonder if it would be better to split it off into UnitPose2d, etc., to maintain the existing Pose2d, etc., functionality.\n\nUgly : The joystick unplugged and missing CAN device warnings are really annoying. I ended up disabling the joystick warnings and commenting out CAN devices, but neither was a great option. I wonder if a better solution would be to throw up a warning in drivestation or the dashboard, and/or send a warning message once every few seconds rather than spamming it. Perhaps it would be possible to set global rate limits for joysticks and CAN devices, or set individual joystick port and device ID rate limits for printing warning messages.\n\n/ \\ /\n\nNot related to anything, but as I go into the land of the alumni, is there any way to positively give back to WPILIB? I have never contributed to open-source projects before, so how do I get started? I am hesitant to start out of fear of making mistakes and causing issues for maintainers, so are there any tips/tricks/rules to keep in mind?",

In particular, we failed in a couple of matches from out of memory errors on a Rio 1. There was probably something that we should have been exposing and monitoring all along that may have pointed us towards that risk that we ended up tripping over in a competition when we implemented a few more advanced auto routines.\n\nAre you looking for telemetry on hardware usage, like CPU and RAM %? IIRC, those are included in the driverstation log files\n\nisaacngkh:\n\nLoop Overrun . Like many teams, we are constantly experiencing loop overrun, which seems to be coming from the SmartDashboard.udpateValue() method\n\nupdateValues() only does what you tell it; usually that looks like polling some sendable object that you added with SmartDashboard.putData , and whatever that sendable is doing is taking a lot of time. Often it’s something like a blocking operation on the CAN bus or a complex calculation that eats a lot of CPU time. Lower frequency overruns do happen in Java, just by the nature of the runtime; the garbage collector and JIT need to pause the program when they run.",

As a first-year mentor trying to pass my knowledge onto our only programming student, I found that I never really was able to rely on the documentation to lessen my load outside of a few hyper-specific cases.\n\nTransitioning him from Command classes to inline classes was really difficult, and in general, teaching all of the new paradigms and correct practices was tough. I’ve already opened an issue about the former case, but there should really be more documentation on best practices with REASONABLE EXPLANATION for why they are good practices.\n\nOther than that; WPILib is awesome. So much better, so much nicer, so much more stable, fewer bugs, the whole 9 yards since I first joined FRC . Its improvement has been great to see, and I hope to be a greater part of its success in the future.",

The only thing you’d really be able to do is cover high level concepts like camera offsets, standard deviations, and maybe how calibration works (although even that process can vary a bit), but I’m not sure how useful that would be, or if that’s even the hardest part of vision.",

Even with just a couple of values being updated we would regularly find 10+ ms updateValues calls in the epoch traces.\n\nTiming in general has become the dominant long pole for us in getting good control performance for multi-DOF mechanisms like the drivetrain, and we had to spend a large portion of the season ruthlessly optimizing code, disabling things that weren’t necessary, and playing around with the dark arts of real-time thread priorities.\n\nThis isn’t just (or even mostly) WPIlib feedback, but the entire ecosystem of Java + WPIlib + Network Tables + the HAL (including vendor libraries) makes it very easy to make the RoboRIO2 bulge at the seams. (Yes, C++ would fix some of this, but that would come at a huge cost to our ability to spin up students).  I’m counting the days until we have a new robot controller…\n\n[will follow with more feedback at some point]",
