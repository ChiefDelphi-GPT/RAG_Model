Does anyone know of ways to increase the acceleration. We have set the open and closed loop ramp rate to 0. We have raised the current limit to 70 but the neos still do not achieve the acceleration we would expect. data 1920×1078 112 KB . The image is our rpm and current logged using data logger. It reaches max speed in a second but it should be able to in less than a second. The current also drops off faster than we would have expected. It reaches a peak and then something appears to pull it back and then it reaches a normal dropoff curve. Does anyone know why the current does this. When testing on blocks it is able to achieve a max speed in half a second.\n\ndata 1920×1078 112 KB\n\ndata 1920×1078 112 KB",

If so, what are the gearing, wheel size, wheel type, and weight of your drivetrain. Do you have a link to your code?\n\nIf you’re using the KOP gearing (or a drivetrain with  the same free speed) and your robot weighs around 70 pounds, this graph is about what I’d expect. The motors accelerate faster on blocks than on the ground because when they are on the ground they are limited by the traction of the wheels with the ground. The slip current and acceleration in the graph aligns with calculated values obtained from reasonable parameters: Drivetrain Simulator - AMB Robotics Calculator\n\nThe only way to increase acceleration would be to increase your wheel’s coefficient of friction with the ground, likely by changing wheels to a different type.\n\nUnder this hypothesis, the reason for the non-steady decrease in current would have something to do changes in the frictional force. Maybe the shift from static to dynamic friction or something to do with the robot bucking or the COF decreasing once the wheels slip.\n\nEdit: Thinking about it more, the last case seems most likely. You may be basically inducing wheelspin when you start the acceleration, decreasing traction. Someone more knowledgeable can probably explain this better. In that case, you would need to implement traction control, or for a more attainable solution perhaps lower the current limit to just below your slip current.",

I cannot remember the gearing, or wheel type off the top of my head but I can find that on Monday. Here is our code: GitHub - FRC4926/CrescendoMain . My mentor had run some calculations and he had told me he was expecting it to accelerate faster than this. Also I had forgot to add this in the original post but we were receiving the same weird current drop with the robot on blocks. Screenshot 2024-02-04 125003 1920×1080 103 KB . On the graph for it on the blocks it has a very sudden drop then it spikes back up again only to sharply fall. We thought it might have something to do with the spark max controlling the current to reach the desired speed. I can attempt to reduce slippage on Monday however I hadn’t noticed any in our tests but maybe I was not paying enough attention.\n\nScreenshot 2024-02-04 125003 1920×1080 103 KB\n\nScreenshot 2024-02-04 125003 1920×1080 103 KB",

I do not know what his calculations were to say it should have accelerated faster. I also am not very familiar with the drop off curves of currents for motors. I am mainly just trusting my mentor when he said the drop from 40 Amps to 25 amps didn’t look like the normal drop off and it looked like something in the controller was pulling it down there. Thank you so much for helping me. I think we may just have to accept this acceleration. Also we expect it was above 40 amps but the refresh rate of the datalogger looks to be somewhere around 100 hertz so it was probably missed in the middle of it. We think this might be true as some of our other logs had max amps well above 40 and the current limit was set to 70.",
