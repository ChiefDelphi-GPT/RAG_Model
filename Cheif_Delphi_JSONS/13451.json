                    "cooked": "A few weeks ago, we switched from SDS MK3s to MK4is and started having significant drift while attempting to drive straight. We are using the same code (a modified version of the 364 BaseFalconSwerve) with the only changes being changing constants (CAN IDs and motor reversals). We are using falcons, CANcoders, and a Pigeon 2.0 and we have on-falcon PID on both drive and azimuth motors. Here is a quick list of the troubleshooting we have done:\n\n-CANCoder magnets are glued down -Ensured that gears are greased well enough and there isn’t too much friction (helped slightly) -Loosened the bolts on the wheels to decrease friction (helped slightly) -Played with azimuth and drive on-falcon PID\n\nWe have now spent over a week working on implementing the solution found in the thread here: MK4 drift We wrote a gyro feedback method and struggled to get the PID tuned in, but we eventually got it to the point where it oscillated slightly but was driveable. We spent about a week on this and still can’t get the oscillating to stop. We continued driving back and forth and the drift had actually gotten worse and this method was doing absolutely nothing to help. I can’t understand why all of this isn’t working.\n\n-Our code can be found here , the newly added gyro feedback method is in SwerveDrive.java under the commands folder -A video of the drift without the gyro feedback method can be found here . It has gotten a little bit better with some of the troubleshooting above but after a few minutes of driving, it is sometimes 90 degrees off\n\nAny feedback would be greatly appreciated!",

                    "cooked": "There are many factors that can cause drifting like this, and a solution is to use the gyro in a feedback loop. To stop oscillating you’ll just need to tune the PID loop better. Try increasing D or decreasing P. Do not use I for this.\n\nIn my research of swerve, it seems that this kind of chassis drift is all but impossible to avoid (without gyro feedback). Minor differences in the modules, loose carpet, not perfectly flat ground, unequal weight distribution, and many more things can cause drift.\n\nThe drift in your video is quite extreme however, so there may be some underlying mechanical, electrical, or software issue causing it. Put your robot upside down or on stilts or something and check that all the modules are precisely lined up when just translating. If they’re not that could also be causing drift. Make sure all your CANCoder status lights are green, make sure all the offsets are accurate and precise, make sure you’re using the right gear ratio to convert to TalonFX encoder counts, etc.\n\nUsing field relative control makes drift matter a lot less, since only rotation gets thrown off, not position. Then a driver can easily adjust the rotation as needed. I would assume that in a match, there aren’t many times where you’re driving in long straight lines without rotating at all, so drift wouldn’t really affect anything.\n\ndisclaimer: my team hasn’t ever fielded a swerve but I’ve been programming swerve for around 6 months now",

From what I have seen so far, the combo of Pidgeon 2.0/Falcons/Cancoders/MK4is with very simple code (ie the 364 BaseFalconSwerve) works incredible well with minimal drift in the time frame of a match. Other larger mechanical or configuration issues may be masked by keeping this in for the time being until you are certain there are no other underlying issues.",
