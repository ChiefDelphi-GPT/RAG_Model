DC motors can be charactierzed by four constants: torque constant kT, backemf constant kb  (often given as kV which is 1/kb), resistance R and inductance L.\n\nA motor with a high kT can output very little power if it also has a really high resistance (see pancake motors). While the manufactures don’t post information resistance/inductance in any capacity, the NEO vortexes and Krakens definitly have a much lower resistance which means that for a given amount of backEMF, they can pull more torque than higher resistance motors which means they have more useful output power.",

                    "cooked": "It’s also possible to estimate a motor’s peak power output knowing only its resistance and the supply voltage.\n\nThe resistance of a motor (assuming everything is nicely linear) can be given by Stall Voltage / Stall Current. So for a Kraken, which has a stall current of 374A, this is a resistance of 12V/375A = 0.0321 ohm.\n\nKnowing that a motor’s peak power output is at stall current / 2 (ignoring free current), we can find that the peak power output occurs at  374/2 = 187A. The power input to a motor here is 12V, so the total power into the motor is 12*187 = 2,244W. We lose a bunch of power to the current flowing through the coils, equal to I^2 * R, which is 187^2 * 0.0321 = 1,122W. So the peak output power should be around 2,244 - 1,122 = 1,122W. The Kraken is interpolated with CTRE ’s data to an output power of 1,136W. You can do the same thing with the FOC stall current of 476A to estimate a peak output power of 1,428W, which is close to the 1,417W interpolated by CTRE . Note that this is a measure only of the motor, and not the Talon FX attached to it - higher current testing would be needed to see how the Talon FX responds to such massive current loads.\n\nSo in general, you can simplify all that down to V^2 / R / 4 = peak output power of a motor. Or Supply Voltage * Stall Current / 4. Now, how do you reduce the resistance to increase the output power? Well, you could reduce the number of windings of a motor and increase the wire diameter. This increases your peak output power (to a point) and increases your kV as well. This could explain why the Vortex, despite having a (presumably) smaller stator volume than the Kraken, is able to get close to the peak output power: the kV is about 11% higher, making more efficient use of the volume.\n\nNote that the effective resistance of a motor is a bit hard to measure. Commutating a motor with 6-step commutation results in a different stall current than commutating sinusoidally or with FOC . For 6-step commutation the resistance is the resistance phase-to-phase of a motor (easy). For FOC it depends on how good your FOC is, but there is a theoretical max… somewhere.\n\nAny motor that you use, you need to apply gear ratios to trade the speed for torque. Power of a motor is the most important metric, as your gear ratio can be designed to maximize performance for any input RPM . I would not want to go back to using 775pros for everything though.",
