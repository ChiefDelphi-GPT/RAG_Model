This year we gave a “Strategic Outcomes” presentation on the Saturday after kickoff to talk with the whole team about where we are in our design process and gather input after having a few concepts. During that presentation, we had this slide: 2025 Strategic Design Outcomes (2) 960×540 340 KB\n\n2025 Strategic Design Outcomes (2) 960×540 340 KB\n\n2025 Strategic Design Outcomes (2) 960×540 340 KB\n\nMost of our strategic decisions this year were focused on this slide - how do we make the simplest robot we can that is competitive as fast as we can. Limiting degrees of freedom was seen as critical to team success. Looking at our buddies over in Windham - image 1247×756 197 KB they also identified that a tilted elevator would likely not require a wrist. After some stealing design convergence, we landed on what we called “Concept 4” - This is pretty clearly a primitive version of the robot that 6324 is competing with this season.\n\nimage 1247×756 197 KB\n\nimage 1247×756 197 KB\n\nhuweym:\n\nWhat was the process you used in testing to determine what angle was optimal for your slant?\n\nTo find the optimal angle for the tilt of the elevator, we made a prototyping rig: image 1920×1446 160 KB\n\nimage 1920×1446 160 KB\n\nimage 1920×1446 160 KB\n\nThis is an aluminum tube we had lying around which is the same OD of the L4 reef pole, mounted to a wooden base which is attached to a big piece of craft cutting board with a .5in x .5in grid.\n\nWe identified that coral at an angle close to the human player station would score on levels 2 and 3, and needed to find an end effector angle that allowed for L4 coral to score. This prototyping rig allowed us to effectively take a few dozen shots and mark a piece of tape on the craft cutting board when we found a shot that works - the tail of the jig that connects to the wall is where the center of the coral is located. The coral is fixed at a storage angle determined by the hopper/human player station (as close to the HP station angle as possible).\n\nTo determine the elevators angle, we at this point just basically connected the dots: where would the top of the end effector need to be in order to have the coral inside our valid scoring positions cone when the robots bumpers were pressed against the reef. We determined that an angle between 5 and 8 degrees would work, and at some point someone suggested “just pick the team number”, so we have a 6.324 degree elevator slope.\n\nhuweym:\n\nHow did you mount your elevator such that it is structurally sound\n\nThe elevator subsystem looks like this: image 850×1588 148 KB image 1154×1598 103 KB\n\nimage 850×1588 148 KB\n\nimage 850×1588 148 KB\n\nimage 1154×1598 103 KB\n\nimage 1154×1598 103 KB\n\nWe have a fundamental design belief on our team that robots will break, and things need to be repairable. To achieve this goal, subsystems must be mounted with 6 bolts or fewer. Bringing back in the whole robot, you can see that the elevator gearbox plates are attached to pieces of 1x1, that have larger hex head bolts that attach to 2x1 frame members below them - image 1382×1056 112 KB There are 4 of these (2 on each gearbox plate) which keeps the elevator attached to the frame.\n\nimage 1382×1056 112 KB\n\nimage 1382×1056 112 KB\n\nimage 610×1478 100 KB image 748×744 54.8 KB\n\nimage 610×1478 100 KB\n\nimage 610×1478 100 KB\n\nimage 748×744 54.8 KB\n\nimage 748×744 54.8 KB\n\nTo give the elevator more bracing, we have 2 20mm od 18mm id carbon fiber rods, with custom markforge tube plugs inside them that are hot glued into the CF rod . These are bolted down with longer shoulder bolts into threaded holes on the support plates at the top and bottom of the robot.",
