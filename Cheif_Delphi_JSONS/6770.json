Even if they are hex-hex clamping mounts.\n\nTension belts. While they don’t need tension to run, adding extra tension takes up the backlash. Eccentric bolt patterns are a nice option here as they don’t come with the downsides of idlers.\n\nAvoid small pulleys and sprockets\n\nDrive arms and hoods from the outside rather than at the pivot point. Driving arms from far away reduces the impact that backlash has on the final angular displacement.\n\nCustom gearboxes with fewer shimmed stages will have less backlash than maxplanetaries with similar reductions.\n\nTolerances matter when dealing with fits. If you are dealing with any sort of fitment, its worth spending the extra few minutes to make the part to 1thou instead of 5thou.\n\nWatch out for general stiffness issues too. Eliminating backlash with all of the above doesn’t matter if your mechanism is made of polycarb or not stiff in some other way and will move around anyways.\n\nOnly use counterspringing as a method of backlash compensation as a last-resort. While at rest it may work, the dynamic loads of many systems are much greater than gravity or the counterspringing is and you will still run into control problems.\n\nFor mechanism not that sensitive to backlash, most of the above is likely unnecessary, however, shim tape is still your friend and don’t drive things from the center if at all possible.",
