                    "cooked": "Hey, my name is Joey and I am the mentor that runs the CheesyCare group for Team 254. I made a post last year summarizing a bunch of the issues we saw commonly on the field and figured it was due for an update this year. If you are unfamiliar, CheesyCare is a 254 competition subteam that tries to help every team at our competitions play at the highest level they can. Reliability is king and having a robot dead on the field is no fun. This year presented a bunch of unique issues to this game and a lot of the same things we see all the time. We also had the unique opportunity to work with FIRST to help run the Team Service Center at champs, something that provided a lot of insight into issues across a larger event. This will probably be a bit of an essay but I will try to keep each part concise and focus on issues we saw and how we resolved them. Last year’s post is linked above and I will try to avoid duplicating too much of that information here, because most of it is still very relevant.\n\nBumpers Mounting: I saw several setups that made the bumpers very hard to remove for inspection. Remember they have to be able to come off quickly and easily for weight inspection. There are a lot of ways to do this, several of which I highlighted last year. I saw these from WCP for the first time this year and they proved to be a nice way to have the bumpers align and bracket in. Cheesycare will likely be picking up a few sets of these for bumper rebuilds. Corner Construction: when building pool noodle bumpers, the rules changed this year to not allow the corner wrap style. We had to rebuild a couple of bumpers this year to have legal noodle layouts. Numbers: there are rules about the size and placement of numbers! Also they need to not fall off and the bumpers are usually the first thing to touch other robots, the field, etc so they can get scraped off if not firmly attached. Staples in the middle of the fabric aren’t great so I like a paint pen and stencils for quick, easy, and durable numbers. Reversible Bumpers: reiterating comments from last year here, they can be done but they are hard to get right and I recommend against them. Oftentimes the fabric will fall down or come loose mid-match which can lead to penalties. See last year’s comments for more specifics.\n\nMounting: I saw several setups that made the bumpers very hard to remove for inspection.

We knew from day 1 this would be a big issue. It happened to us and a lot of other teams where a coral would land in the robot and either break or jam stuff. Elevators and arms have large swept volumes which make covering them hard but some well placed panels can go a long way. Panels can be as simple as cardboard or coreflute cut with scissors or as complex as bent plastic. Surgical tubing also worked well to keep balls out of elevators\n\nOther than electrical things, this was probably our most common thing to work with teams on.\n\nWe knew from day 1 this would be a big issue.

All of the modules have great build instructions and don’t really come with extra pieces. Follow the instructions, don’t skip parts, and keep an eye on maintenance throughout the season. I have noticed a big rise in missing screws, bearings, spacers, etc in modules. Greasing your modules is important for longevity of the gears! I had at least two interactions at a single regional this year where there was a comment along the lines of “we are supposed to grease the gears?” Yes, yes you are.\n\nWith so many teams going swerve, we’ve seen an increase in the number of mis-built modules.

But they aren’t really robust enough to support a cantilevered arm directly off the output shaft. I recommend putting your arm on a more solid shaft setup and then using chain or belts to connect the gearbox to the arm pivot. Gears can work but tend to shear teeth.\n\nMAXPlanetary: these gearboxes are pretty solid, assuming they are built correctly.

I am fully in support of all of these tools as it significantly lowers the barrier to entry for complex auto routines If one of these tools is used, basically removes the ability to “turn the motors on for 1 second at 50% power and drive roughly straight” to cross the line This is not usually a priority for teams prior to events due to trying to score more points, but when all else breaks on the robot, it is an important stop-gap to ensure you can still achieve the ranking point every match. Make sure you have some option here for when your robot isn’t fully working.\n\nGo straight Autos: With the prevalence of swerve drive and path planning tools, it has become more challenging to quickly add a “go-straight across the line” style autonomous.

The most common symptoms are the robot not enabling or controllers not showing up. A simple restart often fixes these weird and hard-to-diagnose bugs. Driver Station Connectivity Script : We have occasionally encountered driver station connectivity issues that are beyond my knowledge. I became aware of this script made by @FletcherS7 at champs when troubleshooting these issues. It changes a bunch of windows settings to resolve a lot of these issues.\n\nThis isn’t a new issue, it has been present for several years, but sometimes you just need to restart the driver station software or computer entirely.

A lot of it is the same as last year so I have focused on new or different issues. Everything from my previous post still applies.\n\nCAN Issues: One particularly challenging-to-debug issue was with the USB-C cable that comes with the CANivore to connect it to the roboRIO. These cables are low quality and it was somewhat common that this was the source of weird and hard to diagnose issues on the CAN bus. Replacing that cable with a higher quality one as well as adding clip on ferrites to the cable helped significantly. This is also a key point for hot glue and zip ties to keep this USB cable secured on both ends.\n\nOne particularly challenging-to-debug issue was with the USB-C cable that comes with the CANivore to connect it to the roboRIO.

On linear systems like elevators , cable chains (energy chains, e-chains, rolling loops, etc) running in a channel are a good way to do this. These e-chains are not designed to be totally full (my rule of thumb is no more than 60% full but if you want to get into the weeds on it, here is a more complete description ), needing space to allow the wires to move inside otherwise there will be issues with the chain breaking. Keep in mind that not every cable will move along the neutral axis of the chain, so they must be able to shift relative to each other. Serviceability: putting appropriate break points on at least one end of the dynamic cabling allows for subsystem removal, maintenance, and debugging. This break point is super helpful but needs to be properly strain relieved so that it doesn’t disconnect mid-match. Avoid putting connectors/wagos/etc in the middle of dynamic cabling. Ideally the dynamic cables are single wires with no connections in moving sections.\n\nConstraining the motion of the wires to avoid catching on the rest of the robot or field elements: wires need to be long enough to reach the full range of motion of the subsystem, but also not totally unconstrained so that they do not catch on things.

This is a common issue on both full-sized and 550 versions. They are incredibly easy to damage when plugging or unplugging the connector or from getting caught on other things (either in use or during assembly).\n\nThe encoder wires coming out of the NEOs are super fragile .

Over-torquing can lead to damaging the motor and the screw threads. Under-torquing can lead to loose connections and unreliable performance. On the power terminals, we actually use 1.2Nm instead of the recommended 0.9Nm. We found the 0.9Nm to slowly loosen over time and not be an issue with 1.2Nm. YMMV The back caps/covers can crush the wires if those wires aren’t positioned quite right. Make sure the wires are routed under the clearances in the cover, rather than crossing where some of the ribs would be. If the power and CAN ring terminals short to each other, this can lead to CAN issues. Proper torquing and alignment of the terminals helps prevent this.\n\nThe screw terminals need to be properly torqued (with the designed torque spec/wrench ) and checked during routine maintenance.

I want to focus this on what I have seen from when teams show up with unfinished/imperfect robots. Please forgive the oversimplification below.\n\nBefore arriving, set realistic goals for your team. When the competition starts, you have the robot you do, and you are truly out of time. Your focus should shift to getting the most out of the robot you have. These will vary for each team, but what I tell the CheesyCare kids are these: Make sure all teams play at least one practice match (may be less applicable for districts) Every team should play every match Avoid major functionality changes at events. Focus on making existing subsystems as reliable as possible without adding complexity. When in doubt, do less. Simple robots with reduced functionality tend to work more consistently than the robot that tries to do everything. At 254’s first event this year, we mechanically removed our ability to score L1 on practice day (and kept it off for the rest of the event) because it wasn’t working, and the robot did better than if we had continued to try to solve it live.\n\nMake sure all teams play at least one practice match (may be less applicable for districts)\n\nEvery team should play every match\n\nAvoid major functionality changes at events.

Not every robot is going to work every time, but the goal should be maximizing the level of play of the robot that you already have.\n\nMake existing subsystems work and prioritize match-by-match. Fix the important things first and prioritize: it doesn’t matter that the elevator doesn’t work if the robot cannot drive. It doesn’t make sense to try to add your climbing mechanism while you are having CAN bus issues that take out the rest of the robot. Focus on being as functional as possible for each and every match. Sometimes the best call is to leave one problem unsolved to focus your pit crew’s energy on a more impactful fix.\n\nIf you are going to miss a match, make sure you send a representative to the field. Sometimes it doesn’t make sense to go to a match (this is an extreme case and I basically never recommend it) in order to fix something. If you are going to miss the match, make sure a person gets sent to the field so that you can get any alliance points for that match.\n\nIn a lot of ways, this was a more gentle game in terms of impacts and robot-to-robot interactions than last year’s game. That led to a lot fewer major structural failures and symptoms of robots playing rough-and-tumble. If we see a game next year that encourages more defense/robot contact I think a lot of what I put in last year’s post will come back as prominent issues that we didn’t see as much this year.\n\nThese were my experiences this year, I am curious to see what everyone else saw this season.",

                    "cooked": "Hey I’m Ian and I was one of the two heads for PulseCrew (StuyPulse 694’s help group dedicated to maximize a team’s ability both on and off the field. Email: pulsecrew@stuypulse.com ) this past season and I just wanted to add some other issues we saw commonly throughout our 3 regionals and Champs. I definitely agree that there were much fewer structural issues this year than others.\n\nBumpers We saw many of the common issues when it came to bumpers and our solutions lined up pretty similarly with CheesyCare’s methods. I will say we did help make quick reversible bumpers for multiple teams and used multiple lines of velcro and one-time use staples to ensure there weren’t any issues during matches.\n\nElectrical Problems\n\nLoose Battery / Main Power Connections: We frequently saw missed coral knock battery and radio connections loose and caused radio power to drop mid-match and helped solve this by  securing them better and moving them out of common impact areas.\n\nMiswired CANcoders: Wrong CAN and encoder wiring were frequent, especially on swerve robots. We see this every year but its a quick fix once you realize where things went wrong.\n\nRadio Imaging - We didn’t see too many issues with the new radio than we had expected from our usage at offseasons and Champs last year, but there were cases of teams (usually rookie teams) unfamiliar on pairing the radio to the field.\n\nExposed Wires / Insulation Damage: Often needed wire mesh or taping to prevent shorts. We saw quite a bit of exposed wiring, especially on the main breaker and we try to explain to teams the importance of keeping them enclosed.\n\nWhile not a common issue, we saw two instances of a live chassis stemming from a LL4 mounted directly onto tubing (solved with PLA printed washers) and a misseated CanCoder causing the screw to touch the frame.\n\nMechanical Problems\n\nWith the widespread usage of elevator mechanisms this year, we saw many instances of wires contacting moving parts and helped prevent any issues by providing cable wraps and using zipties to avoid areas with constant motion.\n\nWe also saw teams where chain tension was loose, and we provided help by teaching them how to properly use chain tensioners and made sure they were good to go for the rest of the competition.\n\nAdditionally I helped multiple teams with their swerve modules; their modules were quite loose and “jiggly” which stemmed from not applying threadlocker on the bolts. Fortunately, there weren’t any instances of modules falling apart on the field, but many close calls.\n\nSoftware & Control System Issues While I have no experience with software and programming, these were some common issues I saw based on our Stat-track sheet, which we use to keep track of our PulseCrew outreach at competitions.\n\nYAGSL Swerve Problems: Multiple teams had oscillation, inversion, or “drift” issues with YAGSL -based swerve code, sometimes due to bad angle offsets, controller mapping, or corrupted templates. In some cases, the fix was rebuilding from a fresh YAGSL template and re-entering CAN IDs.\n\nController Mapping & Binding Errors: Several teams couldn’t drive because joysticks were inverted or mapped incorrectly. Sometimes a bad controller itself was the culprit.\n\nAuto Scheduler Bugs: We saw cases where auton commands weren’t unscheduling at the start of teleop, causing weird behavior. Adding a default drive command fixed this.\n\nGradle / Build Issues: Teams had trouble deploying code due to missing subsystems or Gradle errors; often fixed by cleaning the build and re-importing.\n\nMobility Auto Missing: Many robots lacked a simple backup “go straight” auton, requiring us to help quickly write one at events.\n\nNull Pointers from Missing Subsystems: Especially in teams that reused old code but didn’t remove/replace unused subsystems.\n\nThe most common issue we saw software wise, especially in rookie teams, was mismatched CAN IDs which were a simple fix.",

The most common symptoms are the robot not enabling or controllers not showing up. A simple restart often fixes these weird and hard-to-diagnose bugs.\n\nI helped an alliance partner with a stale Driver Station issue.  They came to me very baffled and worried that something was very wrong, and I asked if they’d restarted the Driver Station.  That fixed their problem.\n\nAt an offseason event, the winning alliance lost a finals match on what I assume was a stale Driver Station issue.  We made a point to restart the Driver Station before each match; however, I think this match, its start was delayed enough for the bug to occur, possibly because the driver station laptop went to sleep (it’d be a good idea to turn that ability off even while on battery power).",

The most common symptoms are the robot not enabling or controllers not showing up. A simple restart often fixes these weird and hard-to-diagnose bugs.\n\nI really hope the current software gets replaced soon, there are too many issues with it.\n\nDuring one match, the drive controller joysticks were completely inverted. Zeroing the gyro during that match didn’t help anything. We believe this was a Driver Station software issue, and we restarted the software, it never happened again.",

Dangling the motor by the leads, etc\n\nWe lost our first Power PCB terminal this year at Sunset Showdown, with the 0.9Nm WCP torque wrench the only thing that ever tightened that motor terminal down and the wires ziptied back to the motor housing (our standard strain relief pattern).\n\nWhen I placed the loose lost terminal back into the housing, it was subtly sub-flush, maybe 0.005\" (“scrape it with your fingernail, you can find the edge”, barely visible). Presumably the PCB is mounted to float up in the housing the extra ~0.005\" to avoid strain at the terminal @R.C ? (I haven’t emailed anything into support yet, we lost the loose piece and I’ve been on summer break)\n\nI have a theory that an “upside down” (or otherwise badly crimped) ring terminal where the ring doesn’t sit flush to the Kraken surface is the other root cause, since standard torque would cause the terminal to try to pull out of the pcb with the full bolt tension, instead of allowing the power terminal joint to get snug.",

You can sort of use that to spoof the timing on the field.\n\nThis year that seemed slightly different for us and the alliance checking code we used in 2024 with no issues began not inverting the robot controls correctly during our first regional.  We eventually just hard coded the robot alliance each match until we had time to sort out the issue after the event.\n\nAt the next regional I talked with a team experiencing some joystick inversions that at the time thought may be similar to ours, but I recall that they were experiencing some problems with the Pigeon 2 initialization sequence.\n\nAs far as pre-match sequence we were using a Canandgyro which status light turns green after calibration.  So we included not moving the robot until then, also every startup with robot in same position facing up field (and rotating later as needed).  Having a less involved setup is a goal this year, but coming up with a consistent way even if a little burdensome is worth it.",

                    "cooked": "At the field before each match, after connecting the gamepads to the laptop (we prefer USB-C-to-C over A-to-C cables; they feel more stable) we go to the USB Devices tab in the driver station, select controller 0 (for the driver), tap a few controller buttons and make sure they update the indicators shown on the driver station, make sure the joystick values are near 0 while not pressed, and then spin a joystick around in a quick circle to make sure all the values look corect and can reach 1 and -1. Then we repeat the same process for the operator gamepad as well.\n\nI’m thinking about implementing code in the robot program that displays something similar to the driver station joysticks tab on a dashboard. We use different controllers for the driver and operator, so it should be possible to use DriverStation.getJoystickName and automatically send an alert if a gamepad ended up in the wrong slot. (Although we never actually had a gamepad end up in the wrong slot since we locked them: FRC Driver Station Powered by NI LabVIEW — FIRST Robotics Competition documentation )\n\nWe used to have a weird bug with our laptop where a controller could be connected to the driver station and show up as green in the joysticks tab, but not actually have any input change when you attempted to use the controller. I think this might have been related to leaving gamepads plugged in while the laptop was in sleep mode. I eventually decided to change the power settings so that the laptop would continue to run while the lid was closed. (We also followed the power configuration recommendations in step 9 of Driver Station Best Practices — FIRST Robotics Competition documentation ).\n\nYou should also make sure to have extra controllers and wires on the robot cart. If you notice a broken controller on the field during match setup, you often won’t have enough time to go to the pit and grab a new one.",

We solve a lot of this kind of stuff with process controls and a pre-match setup process for the driver station. The ones I see most often are a result of semi-disassembling driver stations between matches:\n\nLoose/pulled USB cables\n\nincorrect ports\n\nincorrect axis zeroing (can exhibit symptoms that look like an inverted controller)\n\njoystick numbering mismatches\n\nlaptop falling asleep\n\nlaptop running out of battery\n\nA lot of issues fall into a bucket I generally call “control your own destiny.” None of the control system elements are perfect, but we can work through pretty much every issue we have seen to create very reliable robots. We still have problems, but most of those can be attributed to things we did wrong (loose radio cables, bad driver station settings, no strain relief on wires that can get pulled (both robot side and driver station side)). If you blame the problem on something external, it becomes something that you cannot fix. If you approach the problems with a “how do I fix this?” attitude, you can field highly reliable robots.",

Is it just that the top part quickly spins off, and the middle part holds the bolt down always? Or how do the bumper cones work?\n\nJimmyy:\n\nAny recommendations on torque screwdrivers for 1.2Nm? I like pre-set ones (like the ones CTRE sells), so I can hand it to anyone and they won’t (easily) break it\n\nThis was the one we picked up, and we couldn’t complain, and it came with many different common electronics bits. I handed it to multiple kids without issue. (I think I struggled the most with setting it the first time.)\n\nANPUDS 1/4-Inch Drive Digital Torque Wrench, 0.33-22.1Ft.lbs/0.45-30Nm, Adjustable Electronic Torque Wrench Set with ±1% Accuracy, Vibration, Buzzer and LED Flash Notification for Bicycle, Bike - Amazon.com\n\n$72.98\n\nsoriiku17:\n\nLoose Battery / Main Power Connections: We frequently saw missed coral knock battery and radio connections loose and caused radio power to drop mid-match and helped solve this by securing them better and moving them out of common impact areas.\n\nWith this a good recommendation to everyone. Before competition (or whenever you do your battery maintenance) I recommend undoing every batteries tape, check if the screw is snug, Realign the leads if needed for the robot, and make sure the wires aren’t broken at the crimp. One thing we also did this year during battery maintenance testing, take a reading of every battery with the battery beak, then retest it with a brand new lead as a common denominator. This helped evaluate if any leads were bad.\n\nkitare102:\n\nI’m interested if any teams have a process for checking their controllers for issues pre-match. Any software tools and procedures used would be great.\n\n@Gold87 Can explain better, but we always check each controller pre-match both in the pit and at the field. I know at demos or in the shop, I would go to the controller tab (usb icon) and check through that on inputs, especially making sure the instances didn’t get swapped. (you can only have to have driver and operator swap controllers so many times before you learn )",
