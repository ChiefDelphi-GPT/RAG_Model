We’re trying to decide which platform would be a better experience, and I was looking for some more opinions.\n\nCurrently, we have a tab with diagnostic information such as our motor speeds, temperature, PDP current, etc. We also have a tab for our drive station where we have our camera, round info, autonomous, etc.\n\nI’ve been watching the development of Elastic for a while now and I’m pleased with the progress that’s been happening on it so far, I just can’t tell if it’s developed enough to be something we should switch over to. When we tried Elastic for a demo run, our camera had poor FPS and was very delayed compared to Shuffleboard which was almost flawless. I’d like to switch to Elastic, I just can’t tell if it’s ready yet though.\n\nPlease let me know what you guys think because Shuffleboard has been extremely buggy as well but Elastic has also been buggy, so I just can’t decide which platform would best fit our needs. Let me know what you guys use too, I’m curious as to what teams are switching to nowadays.",

Shuffleboard has been essentially unmaintained since several of its original developers moved on from WPILib. Several newer developments in FRC such as swerve widgets or NT4 (partially completed this year but had some issues) haven’t been fully implemented. There’s also some new features used in Elastic that will become standardized with the new robot controller, remote layout downloading is one prime example.",

I didn’t realize that the Elastic version that is bundled with WPILib is not updated, so I installed the file that was found on your GitHub. Once we had an updated copy, our camera was working at a much more smoother rate. I was very happy to see this working, and our team has made a full migration from Shuffleboard to Elastic for this year.\n\nKeep up the good work, you’ve done a very nice job with Elastic. The only thing I hope to see in the future is grid layouts get added. Otherwise, it’s way more usable than Shuffleboard and has made our lives a lot easier.",
