                    "cooked": "Hello, I’m part of the software division for FRC team 3482 and we have not been able to get PathPlanner to function correctly when rotating during a path. We’ve tried changing a lot of values to no beneficial effect, so any tips are greatly appreciated !\n\nEssentially, we have a 2 meter long test path and the robot is supposed to have a final rotation of 180 degrees. Simply put, it does’t rotate all the way. We’ve tried longer paths but it was no better. PathPlanner telemetry seems to hint at the modules not responding to setting velocities how it expects it to. When we run the bot, it rotates a little bit at first, but then stops rotating and when it reaches the end it rotates a little bit more before stopping short of the 180 degrees (below screenshots of PathPlanner telemetry indicate this).\n\nHere’s what the PathPlanner AutoBuilder config looks like (max drive speed is 1 m/s for now) :\n\nThe rotation PIDConstants are not set in stone, we’ve tried multiple (see below) but it doesn’t seem to fix our problem.\n\nAs you can see the actual angular velocity is always much lower than the commanded velocity.\n\nWe think it’s an issue with either getting/setting the ChassisSpeeds, PathPlanner settings (max angular vel/accel), or constants in the code.\n\ngetModuleStates returns an array of each module’s state : getTurningPosition returns this method’s output\n\nIn our constants, the max drive angular speed is 2π rad/s and the acceleration is π rad/s . In PathPlanner settings, max angular vel is 180 deg/s and the angular accel is 90 deg/s . The max module speeds are 15 m/s , but I honestly don’t know what that value does or how we got it.\n\nThat’s a lot of information but hopefully someone is familiar with PathPlanner and can help us get accurate commanded vs actual angular velocity readings ! With this, we hope it would also fix the overlying issue that the bot doesn’t rotate a full 180 degrees when it should be.",

When simply translating this doesn’t cause a problem but when you go to mix a translation and a rotation the the rotation over powers the translation and the reported rotation speed is drastically smaller in comparison to the command.\n\nIt seems like you don’t have that issue to the extent we did but it seems you might have a similar problem around the scaling / units of omega in your chassis speed.\n\nIn order to figure this out we took the following approach.\n\nThe discretize function in WPILib, that it doesn’t appear you are using can cause some weird things to happen when the magnitudes going into it are wrong so we always comment out that step when debugging.\n\nThe discretize function in WPILib, that it doesn’t appear you are using can cause some weird things to happen when the magnitudes going into it are wrong so we always comment out that step when debugging.\n\nZero out all PID gain and run pure FF.

Our current value for this is around 6 m / s and we designed a fast than normal bot this year. We are still tuning.  This is used to determine how much speed is available in the modules, while translating, to be used for rotation.  If this value is higher than it should be then the bot will try to rotate faster than it is physically cable of rotating at a given translational speed.\n\nI believe the correct way to set this is to determine how fast the drive wheels can spin when the bot is rotating in place.  This value should be higher than your robots max velocity.",
