This is within what I find online for the current carrying capacity of 19 AWG copper wire. For reference, this also fits within the FRC wire sizes, which requires a minimum of 22 AWG copper for a ≤10 A fuse protected circuit. This is assuming your speaker cable is actually copper and not copper-clad aluminum, though that would probably also be alright with these numbers.\n\nThis is assuming that the wire will be used in relatively open air and with people nearby. If this is going to run in a big bundle, behind/under covers or walls, or without supervision, you will probably want a more conservative guideline.",

Manufacturer supplied power, motor, servo, encoder, and sensor lead wires may be extended or modified using custom made or COTS wire extensions subject to the following constraints:\n\ni. Power wires are 18 AWG or larger diameter (for example, 16 AWG wire has a larger diameter than 18 AWG wire). ii. Motor control wires as follows:\n\ni. 22 AWG or larger diameter for TETRIX Max 12V DC motors and REV Robotics Core Hex (REV-41-1300) 12V DC motors ii. 18 AWG or larger diameter for all other 12V DC motors\n\nIt looks like 19 AWG (bigger diameter than 22 AWG) is good for your rev robotics hex motor, while it would not be legal for 12V motors.\n\nNote that the whole manual is written to use copper wire and not copper-coated wires. It will be very hard for inspectors to check on this, though this one would be in your best interest to follow based on the performance (wire resistance) difference.",
