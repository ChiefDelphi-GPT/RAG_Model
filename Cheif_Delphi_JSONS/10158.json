                    "cooked": "Hello Everyone,\n\nHas your team been contemplating attempting swerve, but are not sure whether they have the programming knowledge necessary to make it move let alone go where you want it to go? Have they wanted to try it, but had difficulty justifying the cost of entry for something that may not be a good fit for the team?\n\nWell, we (6762, The Oscats) are in the same boat, and we created a potential solution.\n\nScoot is a 3d printed swerve chassis that uses only 2 REV swerve modules and has a full FRC control system.\n\nThis means you can create a swerve bot for half the price of what a swerve bot would typically cost.\n\nWe are learning a lot with this little bot, and we wanted to share in case it could help other teams figure out whether swerve was right for them.\n\nHere is our documentation.\n\nNone\n\nHere is our Cadd.\n\nSign in to Onshape, the #1 fastest growing CAD system in the world with over 4 million users.\n\nAnd here is our code\n\nContribute to Oscats/ScootCode development by creating an account on GitHub.\n\nThe code uses a modified version of Rev’s Swerve code, but with only two modules.\n\nThere is a lot we have yet to figure out (check out the Known issues), but the robot is working.\n\nIf anyone has any feedback or words of wisdom, we would be open. As I said, we have a lot to learn.\n\nAs I write this, the modules are in stock on Rev’s site , and the motors ( Neo and Neo 550s ) and controllers are  in stock at Andymark.\n\nWe have been trying to design a relatively inexpensive and miniature (so mentors can take it home to explore) Swerve solution for a while now, and this is where we landed.\n\nI posted this in programming as this is largely an experiment in programming. If this is in error, mods, please move it to the correct place.\n\nThank you all for your help. We could not even consider this without all we have learned from and the support of this community.\n\nEdit: I added the CADD link. Our printer is a Prusa MK3+.  We chopped the chassis up into pieces to fit on the base. We have a small issue where we did not know how much PLA was going to expand, so we left too much space for the tongue and groove. This is easily remedied with glue or screws, but eventually we will fix the Onshape.\n\nWe wanted to publish now in case it could help a team considering swerve for next season.",

In doing so, we were able to put the PDP under the chassis. This allowed us to avoid stacking components. Here are the images of the current version.\n\nimage 1542×2048 594 KB\n\nimage 1542×2048 594 KB\n\nimage 1542×2048 594 KB\n\nimage 1920×1446 432 KB\n\nimage 1920×1446 432 KB\n\nimage 1920×1446 432 KB\n\nAnother change is that we only used bolts to keep the chassis together and to attach the swerve modules. We used Velcro for everything else. So, many of the bolt holes are not actually used, and we ended up drilling a few more holes to keep everything together.\n\nWe did use silicone wire as it is more flexible.\n\nI highly suggest printing with support material for the tongue and groove as well.",

                    "cooked": "Hello,\n\nwidekarl:\n\nDo you happen to know the model of that boat PDP or have a link to find it? My team is low on funds, so if we were to do a project like this, we wouldn’t want to have to buy an FRC -legal PDP / PDH . That little version seems like a great option!\n\nWe used this one which is going for 19.95 on Amazon. If you use it, you should use a 120 ohm terminating resistor in the CAN bus. That may be optional, but the documentation says it is recommended, so we use one.\n\nUnofficialForth:\n\nHave you considered a similar version using the new XRP platform? What pitfalls could you see with a team working to integrate something like that.\n\nWe have experimented with many other mini robot platforms. Many of which I have written about other places on CD\n\nHere is a brief history… Vmx pi Romi Vex Edr Micro:bit bots Esp32 bots 2 different Amazon raspberry pi bots 3 or 4 donated tt motor drive bases with no encoders\n\nThere are four issues that arise.\n\nThe sensors are not at the right resolution or easily integrated with WPILib (vex Edr and tt motors)\n\nThe software is too outdated (VMX-Pi)\n\nThere are not enough accessible io ports (or power) to accommodate swerve (Romi)\n\nThere is a websocket layer between WpILib and the robot (Romi and xrp)\n\nAll of these issues can be overcome. In fact the last one is arguably negligible. However, to overcone them, we would have to dig deeper into mechanical, software, or electrical engineering or all three. If we were a team with more experienced engineering chops, we would have done that, but seeing our programmers struggles applying the wonderful 0-auto tutorials to our Romis showed me that if we can take the sample code and make as few adjustments as possible, that would be a better starting point for us.\n\nThere is an argument, and a good one,  to be made that the extra steps will teach us more and make our future robots better. However, the frustration of too many variables is a real thing. We do not have an XRP, and we may have tried that, but when we realized that we can run the robot with 12 volts in a miniaturized format, we decided it was not worth the hassle.\n\nThere is an added benefit to doing it this way as well. You can pull the four bolts for the swerve modules, attach Scoot to a full-size robot, modify the wiring a bit (add a better battery connector and wire two more modules), and now you have a full-size swerve bot.\n\nThis can probably be modified to work with the XRP platform, but after the others posed hurdles, we did not see the point of investigating that solution (which would also be more expensive for us as we do not currently own one).\n\nHaving said all that, we continue to use the Romi, and will also use the VMX-Pi to train our programmers (we want to write companion tutorials to the 0-auto for Romi and Rev hardware), but for this exercise, we decided to go as tournament legal as possible.",
