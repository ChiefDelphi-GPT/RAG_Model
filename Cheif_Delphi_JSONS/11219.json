                    "cooked": "We’ve been really struggling this year with velocity noise on the REV Throughbore encoder. We have one on each side of our drive train (custom WCD), on the same shaft as the center traction wheel (corner omnis), with the quadrature output wired to the DIO on the rio. There’s no noticeable amount of backlash from the wheel to the encoder, and our drive motors are situated by the back wheels, so about 10+ inches away from the encoders. We’ve tried upping the samples averaged in the encoder class, but this doesn’t help as much as hoped.\n\nScreenshot from 2023-03-21 19-39-22 1544×722 29.3 KB This is a velocity vs time plot for the wheel spinning free with the axle disconnected on the default of 1 sample per average.\n\nScreenshot from 2023-03-21 19-39-22 1544×722 29.3 KB\n\nScreenshot from 2023-03-21 19-39-22 1544×722 29.3 KB\n\nScreenshot from 2023-03-21 19-46-13 1544×722 46.6 KB This is another plot with the samples averaged turned up to 60, driven by a drill at different speeds.\n\nScreenshot from 2023-03-21 19-46-13 1544×722 46.6 KB\n\nScreenshot from 2023-03-21 19-46-13 1544×722 46.6 KB\n\nScreenshot from 2023-03-23 10-49-29 1544×717 38.2 KB Here’s similar data, but this time with the velocity calculated by dividing the change in reported encoder distance by the time measured since the last calculation. These spikes are mostly due to GC or some timing wackiness in Java, but similar spikes show up on occasion when running with low (<10) samples per average and higher speeds.\n\nScreenshot from 2023-03-23 10-49-29 1544×717 38.2 KB\n\nScreenshot from 2023-03-23 10-49-29 1544×717 38.2 KB\n\nNote: All these tests were run with the robot disabled and the drive motors disconnected from the controllers, so EMI from motors seems an unlikely culprit.\n\nWe have no ferules on the encoder wires if that’s relevant, and there is about 15-25 degrees worth of wheel rotation in backlash from the axles to the motor output.\n\nAny ideas on why it’s so noisy? We’ve been trying to do path following and the feedback controllers really don’t seem to play nicely with this data. I’ve considered getting the alternate encoder breakouts and just running the encoders to the motor controllers and running PID there, which might be better, but I have some concerns about this affecting our pose estimation with CAN delays and whether it would even help the problem.",

Velocity measurement on the Rio for quadrature type encoders works by measuring the length of the pulses.  The sampling rate is 40 MHz, and the encoder has 2048 cycles per revolution.  If we know how fast the shaft is actually spinning we can estimate how much noise is just due to the FPGA sample rate.\n\nA couple of notes:\n\nThe default samples to average is 4, not 1\n\nThe last plot’s spikes are definitely due to Java timing jitter",

                    "cooked": "Edit: as Joe Ross pointed out, with 4x encoding the FPGA is actually measuring time between any two edges, with 1x it’s measuring duration between the same edge on one of the signals.\n\nAssuming 6\" wheels (18.8\" circumference), 1 meter/s (39.4 in/s) translates to 2.1 rev/sec, and thus ~4300 counts/sec.  With 4x decoding, the time between any two edges should be ~58 us, so at a 40 MHz sample rate that’s ~2300 counts.  Conversely, a 1 count difference will translate into a “noise” of 0.0004 m/s.  So I think we can discount FPGA sampling as the reason for the noise you’re seeing.\n\nIt would be very interesting to hook this up to an oscilloscope to see what the pulse train looks like.\n\nThe problem may be a fundamental incompatibility between the sensor used in the throughbore encoder and the way the FPGA measures rate, at least with 4x decoding.  The AEAT-8800 sensor datasheet has this concerning statement and figure:\n\nWith reference to the output period at A and B. The relative accuracy of the edges to each other at a CPR setting of 256 is within ± 10% for 5V operation in a typical condition. Therefore, based on a period at A or B, the edge occurs in a window between 40% and 60% as shown in the following figure.\n\nI read this as meaning the pulse length may not be well controlled and could vary as much as +/-10%.  This is not at all how optical encoders behave, and would almost certainly explain the noise you’re seeing.  Definitely try 1x decoding, as doing so would change it to measuring rising-to-rising and might mitigate this particular oddity as well as decrease overall measurement noise.",
