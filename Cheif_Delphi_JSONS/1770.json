I am really curious about how you manage students/subteams, your workflow, the balance between mechanical and control system time on each chassis, etc.  If you have any additional documentation I would love to see it too!\n\nThank you!",

This off-season we are making a steel chassis, this will be shop use only. it has a ton of mounting holes, and we can put anything anywhere. AFAIK this will be out new “protobot” chassis. it has also been named “D-Bot/Defense chasis) so Im assuming we may also use it during driver training. We are also a highly developed team about to start its 21st season, we have 20 years worth of resources at our disposal. it would be incredibly difficult for a rookie team to do that. HOWEVER it has been absolutly proven to be possible. Just look at 10014, they were a rookie team in texas, and a GOOD one at that. they IIRC they placed 2nd or 3rd at DCMP and they outperformed us at worlds. 2 chassis has worked for us, but we’ve also been spending every friday and Saturday of build season at the shop until 3am.",

                    "cooked": "We have done different things in past years and what we do next year entirely depends on how “easy” the game is. When bag day was a thing, we would consistently make both a “practice” and real robot that were mostly identical, and continued to try to follow this practice through the 2023 season. In '24 we switched to swerve, and although we only had 2 sets of swerve modules we technically used 3 chassis. In the first week of build season we converted our 2023 offseason bot into our prototyping robot that we used for initial testing, Later in the season (around week 4 of build) we made a “beta” robot that was basically an initial version of our final comp robot, and ran most of our programming and drive practice on that robot before switching to the more polished final version (which we took the modules for from our prototype robot) a little bit before competition. In 2025 which was a much harder game to design for, we initially were going to do the same schedule as 2024, including reusing the same 2023 offseason bot for our prototyping robot, but instead of making 2 separate beta and comp robots that existed independently we ended up swapping out all of the mechanisms on the beta robot for finalized versions over the last few weeks of build season until we ended up with our final comp robot. If next years game is a difficult pick and place, we might plan to do something more like 2025, whereas if we are confident we can get a simple robot out fast we might follow the 2024 schedule.",

Previously we had more than enough falcons to build two, and we also just had our second best season ever (according to statbotics), due to the great mechanical students. I strongly recommend that you don’t make three, as it is expensive, hard to manage, and overall you spend so much time calibrating the three different robots that it does not make the difference.",

Both robots were kept together for most of the season, and any changes that we wanted to make to the comp bot were tested on the practice bot first, so that we wouldn’t change something on the robot going to competitions without knowing how it would impact the rest of the bot.",

If you have more than a dozen members on the team, this paradigm allows both iteration and drive practice to happen full time after week 1 or 2.  At least once, we chose which robot went to competition the afternoon before. Protip: formally identify each chassis up front: A B, blue gold, green silver, whatever.  One year, the mechanical and programming teams had swapped labels.  The result was..less than optimal.",

Our alpha bot was used for initial iterating on systems to find flaws faster and also as a test bed for parts we might need on the Comp bot, if they broke. The goal was to have something we could swap for drive practice if there were repairs needed because we had lost practice time to that in previous years. What we hadn’t counted on was a game where the key game piece could destroy parts of the robot with a simple slip up. Failing to account for a Coral falling in just the wrong place would frequently damage our shooter, but because we had a twin we were usually able to replace it quickly or swap robots and then remake it. Also, not all improvements were tested on Alpha because it was already being used by drivers and Comp wasn’t ready until a day or so before Week 1. This led to us having an untested new cable-management system that didn’t handle the jolts of a match as well as we’d predicted it would.\n\nWe’re considering doing a second chassis again this year, but maybe scaling down expectations by only using the alpha build for initial iterating and early drive practice and/or programming without the need to build a twin. It will be done on the 2025 alpha chassis. Programming would use 2025 Comp for initial auto planning and drive-code updates, allowing for a multi-track effort.",
