I am using one NEO Brushless motor to drive one wheel of the skateboard, with a REV ESC, and I am powering it with 2 12v batteries, 24v total. I planned to use a pulley system to have the motor driving the wheel, with a 3:1 ratio for the pulley. However, the motor’s RPM (around 10,000 rpm) is too high for the speed that I want my board to achieve (15 mph), and there is no gear ratio that will accommodate both the motor and the board’s size. What motor should I switch to in order to maximize speed while still keeping the gear ratio small enough to fit on the board?",

B. make sure one neo is enough to push the weight you want to. I’ve always had trouble figuring the actual math behind this one, hopefully someone else can help here iii. one powered wheel on a 4 wheeled system sounds very unbalanced. imagine if you had a car where the engine only turned one wheel, it would be really inefficient and difficult to run. I would suggest putting an axle connecting 2 wheels, and driving that. essentially creating a 2wd system.",
