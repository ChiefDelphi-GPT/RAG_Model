We may be in a solution where school bureaucracy will force us to use the regular floor carpet. In my experience and from what I have read running on the official carpet is very important, especially in auto. Before we got a dedicated field we always rolled an official carpet into the hall.\n\nAre there any teams that don’t run on the official carpet?

YMMV, but we had the 4th highest auto OPR at the Monterey Bay Regional last season running a 5 ball auto routine, and never had issues with auto accuracy that we believed were connected to our carpet. In general, what I have found is that differences in carpet weave won’t significantly affect auto accuracy until you begin to do more complicated, back-and-forth autos (eg. 4 cube autos in 2018, or 2 game piece autos in 2019).\n\nWe have purchased some official carpet that we will be using instead this season, but this is to protect our flooring now that we have transitioned to using swerve. Especially now that teams can use full-field localization with AprilTags to support more complicated autos instead of relying on odometry, testing your robot on the official carpet isn’t that important. I would also consider how much the offical carpet (Neyland III) costs for you locally, and what else you could buy with that much money.",

I know of many teams that will practice on generic carpet (like school carpet) for most of build season, and then go to a practice field or nearby team with carpet for a few hours/days before their events and tune auto, etc.\n\nAs with most things in FRC , having the material isn’t strictly required, and it won’t automatically make you better, but having access to the right stuff will raise the ceiling. You can only simulate competition conditions so closely. Official carpet will help you get closer, but you should consider if that will be a limiting factor for your team given your other constraints, strengths, and challenges. I’d argue that many teams are totally fine without the official carpet.\n\nJus:\n\nNot having money isn’t a problem, not being able to repurpose isn’t a problem, the school may just make us use the room’s carpet.\n\nI’m not sure I understand what the problem is, if it’s neither the cost nor the waste.

Or do they understand something else?\n\nI’m not asking what you’ve told them, I’m asking what they all understand.\n\n(Also, don’t die on this hill. You’ll be fine without “real” field carpet.)\n\nBut I suspect there’s a communication issue somewhere that’s worth resolving and root-causing, so that when something more important comes up you’re in a better place with your admin.",

In 2022, many teams were able to accurately shoot regardless of the accuracy of their odometry by using their vision system rather than dead reckoning to determine how to aim their shot. Therefore, it was easy to develop an auto routine that would drive past where the balls were placed and not need their odomoetry to be all that accurate in order to collect the game pieces.\n\nIf you use your vision system to locate game pieces and/or locate yourself on the field rather than using dead reckoning to navigate, then the type of carpet that you use when developing the auto routine will not matter.\n\nSo, as vision systems get better and teams get better at using them to navigate, practicing on the official carpet get less important and may not be a factor at all.",
