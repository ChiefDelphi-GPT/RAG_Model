Some recent examples include:\n\n- 3847 2025  \n- 4499 2025  \n- 3005 2023  \n- 971 2023  \n\nI’m curious about other examples and how they are designed. In particular:  \n- What’s the best material for the arm itself? Box tube round tube or spline tube? What material?  \n- For round tube how do you bond the other components to the tube? Is an epoxied plug sufficient?  \n- Is it better to just rotate the end effector on the end of the arm or to lock those together and rotate the whole thing?  \n- Any tips and tricks or things to look out for when designing.  \n\nWould love to know how teams are building these style of bots!",

Just off the top of my head:\n\nDifferential wrist (1323 Mad Town)  \nMotor in CF tube (5460 Strike Zone)  \nMotor on AL tube (more than a few, can’t remember)\n\nTeams using CF tubes often hot glue 3DP parts into the CF tube, allowing removal with a heat gun. Proper tolerances and alignment are key for smooth operation. A CF tube must be large enough to house the motor and gearbox, with the output shaft integrated into the wrist.\n\nFor the arm, most designs use a 2-inch box tube. Some include a bearing, others a gearbox or Lazy Suzan bearing. Differential wrists function independently, requiring precise control logic to prevent crashes. Alternative setups involve using a single wrist with a bevel gear instead of two degrees of freedom.",

Same answer for turrets.\n\nFewer degrees of freedom generally is better — to a point. Or to put it another way: don’t scope creep, especially for the coolness factor (unless the coolness factor is one of your specific outcomes for your particular program).\n\nNow some teams will absolutely have enough various resources (money, time, expertise, and so on) to make it happen. There were teams last season that really did surprise me with wrists.\n\nAt the very least, if you do try within season, have it done weeks ahead of time. You will need time, money, and patience to get a complicated system as reliable as a simple one.\n\nIf you look back through the most lauded robots in FRC history, they generally fall into two camps:\n\nFirstly, the right people were there to pull off something beautifully complex.\n\nSecondly, the right people were there to pull off something beautifully simple.",

What material?\n\nAluminum is cheap and easy to work with, and familiar, and is a fine option. You can go quite thin with the tube as the round profile is significantly more resistant to localized buckling than boxtube is.\n\nCarbon fiber is actually viable for reduced weight and increased stiffness, and one of the few times where carbon fiber in FRC is strongly worth considering. Buy some nice roll-wraped tubing and avoid pulltruded tubing, as pulltruded tubes have the fibers only go in one direction, therefore making the arm extremely weak to most types of loading.\n\nIs it better to just rotate the end effector on the end of the arm or to lock those together and rotate the whole thing?\n\nDepends on how much you value weight and MOI vs ease of manufacturing.\n\nIf you have access to good manufacturing resources, rotating the entire end effector would be the best as allows you to place the rotation motor, gearboxes, and bearings opposite of the end effector, reducing the effect of gravity, coupling dynamics with the DT, and high CG. The base pivot joint can be non-trivial to design manufacture in this case, with the stiffest option being a single billet like 971 does, but using more 2.5D parts is also an option if you are careful where the plates meet.\n\nIf resources are limited, or you want to attach more things to the arm (e.g., 3005 2023 making the arm extend), it may be easier to just shove the gearbox on the end and deal with the extra weight in a bad spot.\n\nRunning a large hex shaft through the arm is an option, however, I would personally avoid it due to the poor torsional stiffness of small shafts. Either of the two other options are better in this case.\n\nFor round tube, how do you bond the other components to the tube? Is an epoxied plug sufficient?\n\nClamping is my preferred option for round tube as it doesn’t permanently attach anything like glue does while avoiding weakening the tube. Clamps can be made of a pair of side-tapped plates, or as one single part and split using a slitting saw. If you are using aluminum, welding or drilling into the tube are also options. For a CF tube, epoxy or hot glue with sufficient surface area is an option if you don’t mind the attachment being permanent, but drilling should be avoided as CF doesn’t like its continuous fibers being broken, and CF often delaminates when drilled, even when drilled correctly.\n\nAny tips and tricks or things to look out for when designing.\n\nStiffness is key for revolute joints in general, poor stiffness or backlash can cause large movements of the end effector due to the lever arm, which is extremely bad and significantly slows down scoring due to waiting for the arm to settle down. You will notice that most good arms are extremely stiff and most bad arms have stiffness issues.",

This material provides the advantages of both box and round tubing allowing for easy torque transfer and mounting while retaining the clean integration with bearings. In my opinion it is the best of both worlds.  \n\nIs it better to just rotate the end effector on the end of the arm or to lock those together and rotate the whole thing?  \n\nIt depends on the design goals. We chose to rotate at the base joint to concentrate weight near the pivot and simplify control. However some designs like 3005 in 2023 and 971 in 2023 rotate the end of the arm instead reducing moving mass.  \n\nAny tips and tricks or things to look out for when designing",

In the 2023 off-season, we needed to strengthen the MAXSpline in our double-jointed arm to prevent some bending and deforming of the spline profile. In 2023, we used an ⅛” wall 1” OD aluminum shaft for this, which worked well but was heavy and didn’t directly support the spline profile. This year, we wanted to find something better. The CF tube we purchased from Clearwater Composites provides more rigidity and supports the ⅜” Round Hex bearing in the twist shaft to allow coaxial power transfer for our claw’s roller.",

One team member mentioned, “Ooohhh, they do X with Y mechanism. They’ve solved that problem, so we can solve that too.”  \n\nTo address the forces involved, we conducted some math calculations. This explains why they can achieve smaller components like bearings, shafts, or structures due to specific reasons related to gear ratios. For example, they use ABC gear ratio here because of XYZ reason, and opt for chains, belts, or gears based on the challenges present elsewhere. This allows them to maintain efficiency and precision.  \n\nFinally, integrating these insights into CAD ensures the kids develop practical skills, while also providing a pre-solved solution if a similar issue arises next year.",

The revised version removes unnecessary HTML tags, anchors, and redundant information, ensuring clarity and conciseness. Here is the cleaned paragraph:\n\nHere is a quick screenshot of the CAD for our wrist that we used this year. The design was initially inspired by 971’s 2023 robot but was mostly created from scratch using components our team already had in the shop or were familiar with. We utilized a SplineXL shaft as our arm and incorporated MAXSpline Bearing Blocks sandwiched between two aluminum plates crafted in-house. For the claw mechanism, we employed a Kraken X60 paired with an Andymark Sport Gearbox, utilizing custom 3D printed pulleys to achieve precise belt tension, minimizing backlash to less than a degree or two. The claw was securely fastened to the arm's endpoint via a custom bracket and a MAXSpline Shaft Collar. The design proved quite sturdy, though early wiring attempts encountered some challenges due to an overly optimistic approach in routing wires through the shaft near an encoder measuring rotation. This issue was resolved by simplifying the wiring pathway. During the competition, a minor crack appeared in one of the side plates, likely caused by the claw temporarily entangling around an encoder reel, risking potential damage. To ensure longevity, a replacement plate was installed promptly.",
