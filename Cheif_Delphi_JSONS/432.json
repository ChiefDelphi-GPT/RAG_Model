In particular:\n\nWhat’s the best material for the arm itself? Box tube, round tube, spline tube? What material?\n\nFor round tube, how do you bond the other components to the tube? Is an epoxied plug sufficient?\n\nIs it better to just rotate the end effector on the end of the arm or to lock those together and rotate the whole thing?\n\nAny tips and tricks or things to look out for when designing.\n\nWould love to know how teams are building these style of bots!",

The plug needs some care with the design for proper tolerances and to void point loads on the CF tube (a slight 2nd order taper at the end and tune in the part for a light hand press force insertion.)\n\nA CF tube that is big enough to enclose the motor and a gearbox where the output shaft is also the wrist.\n\n2\" box tube for the arm. Some have a bearing / shaft, some a gearbox/shaft. some use a smaller “Lazy Suzan” bearing.\n\nDifferential wrists are their own thing. Mechanically it’s pretty simple, but the controls state machine needs to be done well to avoid crashing. Also possible to remove 1 DOF and just do a wrist via bevel gear.",

                    "cooked": "Nick.kremer:\n\nWhat’s the best material for the arm itself? Box tube, round tube, spline tube? What material?\n\nThin round tube (maxspline counts as round). Aluminum is cheap and easy to work with, and familiar, and is a fine option. You can go quite thin with the tube as the round profile is significantly more resistant to localized buckling than boxtube is.\n\nCarbon fiber is actually a viable for reduced weight and increased stiffness, and one of the few times where carbon fiber in FRC is strongly worth considering. Buy some nice roll-wraped tubing and avoid pulltruded tubing, as pulltruded tubes have the fibers only go in one direction, therefore making the arm extremely weak to most types of loading.\n\nNick.kremer:\n\nIs it better to just rotate the end effector on the end of the arm or to lock those together and rotate the whole thing?\n\nDepends on how much you value weight and MOI vs ease of manufacturing.\n\nIf you have access to good manufacturing resources, rotating the entire end effector would be the best as allows you to place the rotation motor, gearboxes, and bearings opposite of the end effector, reducing the effect of gravity, coupling dyanmics with the DT, and high CG. The base pivot joint can be non-trivial to design manufacture in this case, with the stiffest option being a single billet like 971 does, but using more 2.5d parts is also an option if you are careful where the plates meet.\n\nIf resources are limited, or you want to attach more things to the arm (e.g. 3005 2023 making the arm extend) it may be easier to just shove the gearbox on the end and deal with the extra weight in a bad spot.\n\nRunning a large hex shaft through the arm is an option, however, I would personally avoid it due to the poor torsoinal stiffness of small shafts. Either of the two other options are better in this case.\n\nNick.kremer:\n\nFor round tube, how do you bond the other components to the tube? Is an epoxied plug sufficient?\n\nClamping is my preferred option for round tube as it doesn’t permanently attach anything like glue does while avoiding weaking the tube. Clamps can be made of a pair of sidetapped plates, or as one single part and split using a slitting saw. If you are using aluminum, welding or drilling into the tube are also options. For a CF tube, epoxy or hot glue with sufficient surface area is an option if you don’t mind the attachment being permanent, but drilling should be avoided as CF doesn’t like its continuous fibers being broken, and CF often delaminates when drilled, even when drilled correctly.\n\nNick.kremer:\n\nAny tips and tricks or things to look out for when designing.\n\nStiffnes stiffness stiffness. For revolute joints in general, poor stiffness or backlash can cause large movements of the end effector due to the lever arm, which is extremely bad and significantly slows down scoring due to waiting for the arm to settle down. You will notice that most good arms are extremely stiff and most bad arms have stiffness issues.\n\nSands:\n\nsome use a smaller “Lazy Suzan” bearing.\n\nDo not use lazy susen bearings, as lazy susan bearings are typically only designed for compressive loads, while arms typically apply large radial and moment loads. Any pair of most bearings can be used (radial, x-contact, or angular). Xcontact bearings can be found cheaply on thriftybot for imperial bearings or Mcmaster for metric bearings.",

                    "cooked": "Nick.kremer:\n\nWhat’s the best material for the arm itself? Box tube, round tube, spline tube? What material?\n\nFor round tube, how do you bond the other components to the tube? Is an epoxied plug sufficient?\n\nWe’ve found MaxSpline to be a great choice. It combines the benefits of both box and round tubing. Like box tube, it allows for easy torque transfer and mounting. At the same time, it retains the clean integration with bearings that round tube offers. In my opinion, it’s the best of both worlds.\n\nNick.kremer:\n\nIs it better to just rotate the end effector on the end of the arm or to lock those together and rotate the whole thing?\n\nIt depends on the design goals. We chose to rotate at the base joint , which helped concentrate the weight closer to the pivot and simplified control. That said, 3005 in 2023 rotated the end of the arm instead and were able to reduce moving mass. 971 in 2023 also rotated their forearm section.\n\nNick.kremer:\n\nAny tips and tricks or things to look out for when designing.\n\nHere are a few things we learned during design and competition:\n\nHere are a few things we learned through the design process and through running it for a season.\n\nPreview-20250515 480×976 90.4 KB Keeping this bearing distance as large as possible will help keep the shaft from wobbling.\n\nPreview-20250515 480×976 90.4 KB\n\nPreview-20250515 480×976 90.4 KB\n\nTo attach things to the end you can use the large shaft collars and the MaxPattern 2x1 to have mounting holes at the end. This also makes swapping super easy. image 1536×2048 309 KB\n\nimage 1536×2048 309 KB\n\nimage 1536×2048 309 KB",

We used Carbon Fiber for weight, but you can use Aluminum tube just as well (We used aluminum without epoxy in 2023.5 and it provided enough stiffness)\n\nSpectrum 3847 | Build Blog 2025\n\nOur robot uses three MAXSpline pivot shafts for its shoulder, elbow, and twist. In the 2023 off-season, we needed to strengthen the MAXSpline in our double-jointed arm to prevent some bending and deforming of the spline profile. In 2023, we used an ⅛” wall 1” OD aluminum shaft for this, which worked well but was heavy and didn’t directly support the spline profile. This year, we wanted to find something better. (Disclaimer: We are #TeamREV )\n\nWe decided to use a 0.991” OD x 0.875” ID CF tube as the main stiffener for the MAXSpline. This CF tube makes the structure more rigid and allows us to put a ⅜” Round Hex bearing in the twist shaft to allow coaxial power transfer for our claw’s roller.\n\nThe CF tube we purchased from Clearwater Composites. The photos below is of the final products.",

I’m curious because my team has a whole bunch of less experienced students who want to learn how to build better robots and solve harder problems. We’ve been successful at building relatively simple robots and doing well with them, but we want to develop the capability to develop more complex mechanisms and also teach our students how to solve hard problems but still execute them well on strong timelines because we would like to have the same (if not better) level of optimization while winning more matches.\n\nWhat is your advice for how we can develop our skills, be it in offseason or onseason?",

They use ABC gear ratio here with this arrangement because of XYZ reason. They use chain / belts / gears because of this issue over there. etc. etc.\n\nGreat, now let’s put that into CAD so the kids develop some skills AND we have a pre-solved solution if that problem comes up next year.",

                    "cooked": "Here is a quick screen shot of the CAD for our wrist that we used this year. The design was initially inspired by 971’s 2023 robot, but we designed mostly from scratch using components our team either had in the shop or were familiar with.\n\nimage 654×689 66.3 KB\n\nimage 654×689 66.3 KB\n\nimage 654×689 66.3 KB\n\nOverall the design worked pretty well for us! We used a SplineXL shaft as our arm and used the MAXSpline Bearing Blocks sandwiched between two aluminum plates made in house. We used a Kraken X60 with a Andymark Sport Gearbox for rotation with custom 3D printed pulleys to achieve our desired belt tightness which helped us control a lot of the backlash but there was still some, maybe plus or minus a degree or two. Our claw was mounted to the end of the arm using a custom bracket and MAXSpline Shaft Collar .\n\nOverall, the design was very robust. The only real issues we had was with our initial wiring solution (got a little optimistic trying to run wires up through the shaft around an encoder measuring rotation) which we were able to solve by simplifying our wiring path. Towards the end of the season, we noticed that we had cracked one of the side plates, but that was liklely caused by the claw getting stuck in the reef once. It probably would have held up, but we changed it out with a backup just to be safe.",
