                    "cooked": "Hello! For the past month, I have been working on a NetworkTables client, written from scratch using Rust! In fact, I even released version 0.2.0 (not quite a 1.0.0 release yet) just today. It includes full coverage over the NetworkTables 4.1 spec , which includes things like subscribing and publishing to topics.\n\nThe intended use for this library is within coprocessors. Writing in Rust means that you get better performance and memory usage than Java and even C++ in some cases, plus the developer experience is an extra bonus.\n\nFor some background, I started this project because I wanted an alternative to Shuffleboard. Don’t get me wrong, I think Shuffleboard is great, but it can get very slow, and the plugin system can be a hassle to work with. So I began work on a custom dashboard that runs alongside a robot program (via a bootstrap executable) that runs a webserver locally. The webserver would then be the entrypoint to interacting with the NetworkTables server. I couldn’t find many up-to-date and good implementations of the NetworkTables spec, so I decided it would be fun if I made my own!\n\nGitHub crates.io\n\nI would love for any of you Rust fanatics to give it a try (and find any bugs I may have missed)!",

Glass and AdvantageScope are packaged with WPILib and both offer great diagnostic tools and can be used as driver dashboards kinda.\n\nThere are plans to make a web-based dashboard that’s hosted on the rio for 2027. The rio is already dying a death of a thousand cuts on the performance side and it’s not super worth it to add any more layers of indirection for data in a dashboard. If you would like to host the dashboard on the rio I would recommend using a TS/JS nt4 client to save on the on robot performance.\n\n*shuffleboard API in robot code is incredibly slow and elastic supports local layouts so you can use any logging framework",

I still have to figure out a plugin/widget system for it though, and I’m not entirely sure how I would do that with tauri. I’d have to do more research. I do want to stick with something similar to HTML/CSS though, as it’s way easier to work with and will be much easier to make plugins for.
