                    "cooked": "Hi all, This year, my team has made some pretty nifty stuff with software that we definitely want to use in the future. However, I want to avoid setting us up to just copy/paste code from GitHub to a new repo. I’m looking at building a library that could be shared and installed just like a regular vendordep. I’ve generated a new gradle java library project, but my major roadblock so far has been figuring out how to connect WPILib to the project correctly.\n\nMy code is all available here , and here’s a brief overview of my problem:\n\nThe LSP I use seems to recognize that I’ve got WPILib-related tools installed. It automatically imports classes like Rotation2d , and can show the tooltip javadocs for them. So it is (at least partially) connected to WPILib. The major issues come at runtime: I can use class constructors like new Rotation2d(x, y) and methods like Rotation2d.getCos() , but I can’t use constants like Rotation2d.kZero . I get an issue that the symbol is not found, but - just like the other methods/constructors - I still get an indication from the LSP that those constants are there. I get autocompletion with their names, and javadocs on hover.\n\nI was trying originally to follow along with the posts from this thread on using the vendordep template, and they seem to have solved the problem. The only issue? The repository that was linked is no longer available . All other repos that I’ve seen in my search are quite old, and don’t work anymore when I clone the repo and run ./gradlew build .\n\nI’m definitely looking to hear any and all suggestions, but if you or your team have used a similar solution that works, please share. I should mention I’m writing code in Java, but I don’t know if this matters with dependencies or whatnots. Thanks!",

You’d have to wait about 3 minutes for every single test. Not to mention how much harder this could be if a change was needed mid-competition, without WiFi or time. Perhaps there’s a better way I don’t know of.",

On the other hand, the readme says:\n\nA java library is built. This has access to all of wpilib, and also can JNI load the driver library.\n\nIt sure seems like I should be able to use WPILib classes, like Rotation2d . What am I missing here?",

Finding and maintaining all the copies is a maintenance nightmare not to mention the problem that “if data are in two (or more) places, one or the other or both are wrong.”",

Should this be included in the vendor-template build.gradle by default, because it seems like using WPILib types in tests is a pretty common scenario?\n\nI’m now going to try and make both a jitpack build as well as a vendor-template version now that I’ve got them working, because why not. Thanks to everybody who gave advice here so far!",
