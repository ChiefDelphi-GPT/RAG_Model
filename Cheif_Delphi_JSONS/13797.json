But now we’re trying to use the software PID for certain functions that may not be directly based on the CTR hardware. The question I have is - how do I specify the max and min output values? Code analysis appears to indicate that for a simple P-robot (with I and D turned to 0, for instance) the outout is simply calculated as the PID ERROR multiplied by a P value. Now, we need to control the motors, meaning, we need to provide an output value between -1 and +1, and we also used hardware PID to account for maximum velocity etc. The old PIDSubsystem had setOutputRange, which I am not sure can be used with the PIDCommand now in wpilib2. Also is there a way to specify the maximum velocity to be accounted in PID calculations? In other words, I’d like to see how can I accomplish a simple PID profile (trapezoid is preferred, but even the max acceleration one would do).",

It appears I can specify max velocity and max acceleration.\n\nRe: clamp - thank you for the suggestion. We can certainly do so. However, its use will still depend on the min/max values. Does it mean that at the initialize of the PID we need to determine the difference between the current and target values and use that for our value clamp?\n\nYou also mentioned that the motor set does the clamp automatically. But where does it get the min and max for it?\n\nExample - we have a sensor that goes between -420 and +420. We can zero it if needed. We want to run PID for the movement between, say, points 0 and +192 (the values will change). In this case depending on the PID constants (say P=1, the others are 0) I will get the output value of 192 initially, which will decrease.\n\nI’d like to feed that to the arcadeDrive. So, feeding 192 to the arcadeDrive is not really useful. I mean, it will be clamped at 1. And that means I will get a value of 1 until almost very end. It will, of course, correct at the end of the trajectory. But for the most of the drive it will indeed be a value much higher than 1.\n\nThe question I have is about making the whole process smoother. Am I correct that with low value of the absolute error and the low value of the usable output we need to start with really low P values, in such case around 0.01, especially if the expected drive-to-target time is less than a second? In this case what do teams usually do when they need to cover a wide range of distances (e.g. if expressed in encoder ticks - sometimes cover 10,000 ticks, and other times - 200,000 ticks) - use the same PID controller values, or apply two different PID values in such situations to make the drive “smoother”?",

The goal is to keep the voltages involved away from saturation so you don’t have a loss of control authority, and the movement becomes more repeatable. For example, if you’re applying 12 V and a distance error develops, you have no voltage headroom for corrections.",

In other words, if my Kp is right (and reasonably small), and I set a profile with the max velocity and max acceleration, the output produced will be in a reasonable -1…+1 range for both the short and long “distances”, and it will be close to +1 or -1 for the “cruise driving at maximum speed” rather than starting at ridiculously high numbers and dropping down as the goal is approached. Did I misinterpret that?",

Since the turn takes little time, as long as you adjust your Pd well, the turn works fine without oscillating, with very little error. For now we’re sticking with the hardware PID for linear travel, which worked fine for us in the past.",

It does not depend on the setpoint in any way, except transitively through the error calculation.  One could write a PID controller API which takes a single “error” parameter and never sees the setpoint at all!",
