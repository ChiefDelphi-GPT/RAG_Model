                    "cooked": "Hello, I am trying to incorporate ideas seen in multiple posts ( post 1 about rotational feedforward and post 2 about tangential feedforward ) to code the feedforward for our turret this year. As I want the turret to stay locked on the target as we move around the field, I think the feedforward will have to take into account the tangential velocity of the robot with respect to the target as well as the rotational velocity of the robot (we are using mecanum drive).\n\nI think I have figured out how to find the tangential feedforward based on the robot’s tangential velocity and distance to the target, and the rotational feedforward would just be the opposite of the robot’s angular velocity.\n\nAlso I was thinking I should use the WPILib SimpleMotorFeedforward class along with the SysID tool to make it more accurate.\n\nSo I was wondering how exactly to implement all of this together on top of PID control. I was thinking something along the lines of\n\nmotorTurret.setVoltage(pidController.calculate(getEncoderVelocity(), setpoint) + simpleFeedforward.calculate(setpoint) + tangentialFeedforward + rotationalFeedforward);\n\nWould this work? Should I be using a velocity or positional PID here? I am pretty new to complicated control stuff like this. Thanks.\n\n-Samuel",

I am working on the turret stuff now and am going to figure out all the details of tuning the actual shot and accounting for the robot’s velocity by offsetting the angle of the shot later. I know this is something that will be hard to pull off but I am somewhat confident I can figure it all out.\n\nHere is my turret subsystem:\n\nAnd here is the command so far for tracking the target throughout the match which I will have running 24/7:\n\nAlso, could you explain what you mean by cascading the controllers?",

Is this what you were thinking when you talked about modifying the setpoint directly?\n\nsetpointV = setpointV + tangentialFeedforward + rotationalFeedforward; motorTurret.setVoltage(pidController.calculate(getEncVelocity(), setpointV) + simpleFeedforward.calculate(setpointV));\n\nThe problem I am having with just using a position pid instead of a velocity one is that I am not sure what I would be putting as the position setpoint. With the velocity control, I can just make the desired velocity setpoint (before adding the feedforward) proportional to the Limelight tx angle. If I wanted to use position control then I think I would have to take into account the robot’s position on the field because if I was at a different place on the field then the angle (relative to the robot) that the turret would need to be in order to score would be different. Is this correct or am I completely missing something simple?\n\nEdit: if I did position control, would setting the setpoint to be turretAngle - tx work? Then I could do:\n\ndouble pidOutput = pidController.calculate(angle, angle - tx); motorTurret.setVoltage(simpleFeedforward.calculate(pidOutput) + tangentialFeedforward + rotationalFeedforward);\n\nIs this what you meant when you said this?\n\nOblarg:\n\nyou can probably do fine with a “flat” position controller (in which case you only need to cascade to the SimpleMotorFeedforward ).\n\nAssuming both velocity and position control work, is there any benefit to using one over the other or would they have the similar results/smoothness?\n\nEdit 2: I have come to the realization that\n\npidController.calculate(angle, angle - tx)\n\nwould give the same exact output as\n\npidController.calculate(tx, 0)\n\nwhich is probably what you meant in the first place. Oh man.\n\nAlso, for the position control, instead of this line:\n\nwould I be better off with this one:\n\nmotorTurret.setVoltage(simpleFeedforward.calculate(pidOutput + tangentialFeedforward + rotationalFeedforward));",

The turret would not be able to move even if it were offset if the bot wasn’t moving since the pidControl would be limited to 3 volts. Honestly, I think your solution is a little overcomplicated. (or maybe I’m just underthinking it ) I would suggest trying to rewrite your code to make it a little simpler. There are 2 ideas I can think of. For positional control, try:\n\nFinding the angle the turret should go to (seems you already have a good start with your vision tracking math)\n\nConverting that into motor ticks (angle / 360 (or 2pi) * encoder_resolution)\n\nPassing that value into a positional control system (the talonfx has a built-in system for this, try taking at look at our code if you need some inspiration (either look at the climber.cpp in obob’s code, or the positional control in swervemodule.cpp in any of our black widow repos) CTRE also has some decent documentation.\n\nMake sure to add a ramp rate and limits to make sure you don’t break your turret\n\nFor velocity control, you could do:\n\nFinding the angle the turret should go to\n\nUsing a PID controller to convert angle to velocity (either a wpilib one, or something you implement yourself, like we did here): int error_theta = (theta - getAngle()).to<int>() % 360; // Get difference between old and new angle && gets the equivalent value between -360 and 360 if (error_theta < -180)  error_theta += 360; // Ensure angle is between -180 and 360 if (error_theta > 180)  error_theta -= 360; // Optimizes angle if over 180 if (std::abs(error_theta) < 5)  error_theta = 0; // Dead-zone to prevent oscillation double p_rotation = error_theta * rot_p; // Modifies error_theta in order to get a faster turning speed if (std::abs(p_rotation) > max_rot_speed.value())  p_rotation = max_rot_speed.value() * ((p_rotation > 0) ? 1 : -1); // Constrains turn speed\n\nConverting to actual motor control (feed forward? talonfx velocity control loop?)\n\nBest of luck!",

Do you think tuning this feedforward accurately would correct for the problem of camera latency ( described here ) as long as I kept my kP low, or should I be implementing that separately?\n\nIf I am moving fast, my pid will effectively be fighting against the feedforward for those ~25ms until I receive my next limelight image. Because the pid wants to go back towards the old target while my feedforwards “knows” the target is actually somewhere else and so is moving towards the actual target. Thoughts?",

The references to “self-defense lighting” suggest it is the kind of brightness and field of view that can quickly hurt people and create lasting safety issues. The Limelight certainly is producing a useful, bright light, but not on the same magnitude as these products.\n\nIn past years, most notably 2012, teams would use very high intensity lights to allow drivers to manually align their robots with goals. This rule was created to require teams to be able to switch these lights off.",
