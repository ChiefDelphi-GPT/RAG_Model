                    "cooked": "Hi CD.   It’s been a year and a half since I posted a design for a Swerve Module that teams with modest manufacturing resources can make in house.    Although my team hasn’t had a chance to build one yet (our quarantine only recently ended),  two other teams built variants of the design in 2020/2021.  That’s extremely gratifying, but also provides some good “Operating Experience” to feed back into design improvements!\n\nWith that in mind, let me present two more Swerve Designs which you can build in-house (if you have access to a router and a 3D printer and mayyybe a lathe, but maybe not).\n\ncx21-swerve7-render2 1472×1056 64.9 KB\n\ncx21-swerve7-render2 1472×1056 64.9 KB\n\ncx21-swerve7-render2 1472×1056 64.9 KB\n\nOK, the name is pretty uninspired, but it’s arose after mucking around with at least 6 other design ideas.  I’m happy to hear better naming suggestions!   The key points of this design are:\n\nMotors are flipped, for an overall height of only 6.5\".   I think this is possible the shortest module design I’ve seen for 4\" wheels, and it means the whole module fits below the bumpers even if the ground clearance is only 1.5\".\n\nMotors are flipped, for an overall height of only 6.5\".

Ratio can be adjusted to your liking, since the pulleys are 3D printed.  Uses a double wheel setup like the Thrifty Bot module as a result.   The forks are made from 2D cuts in 4\" square box tube.\n\nDrive is 2 stage (instead of 3) for better efficiency.  Ratio can be adjusted to your liking, since the pulleys are 3D printed.

Swerve8 was a dead end, but I’m happy enough with the 9th try .  The key points of this design are:\n\nMore traditional motor-on-top mounting makes the module 1.5\" taller than Swerve7, but also about 1.5\" less long.  At 8\" tall, it’s still shorter than most COTS options.\n\nMore traditional motor-on-top mounting makes the module 1.5\" taller than Swerve7, but also about 1.5\" less long.

The miter gear shaft has also been pushed a bit further from the steering axis than my previous design (1.25\" instead of 1\").  Doing both these things lets me accomplish a lot of goals: Lets me support the miter gear shaft with flanged bearings in the azimuth plate.  There are no bearings in the forks.   The shaft then becomes a simple cut-and-tapped bit of thunderhex.  The upper bearing is supported in the 3D printed steering pulley. This makes the forks much simpler - in fact they can be almost entirely made in a single Op in a router.  Only the tapped mounting holes have to be added, and I imagine a 3D printed jig could make that into a hand tool job. Lets me fit a 1.5\" Colson Wheel beside the bevel gears. To mount the gears I imagine that the WCP gear could be silver-soldered to a 1.25\" OD x 1.125\" ID tube, and then they would be pressed into the Colson Wheel.  If that doesn’t work, this design is also compatible with both SDS and WCP billet wheels\n\nMoves the “Azimuth plate” down to just above the small miter gear.

I was hoping that by having so many parts routered or 3D printed, the cost of these modules would come down under $300 ea.  Unfortunately, when I took the time to write out and price the Bill of Materials , I found that just the COTS parts alone cost over $350 That’s still cheaper than the WCP or SDS COTS modules, but still more expensive than hoped. I clearly have work still to do to reduce costs.\n\nHere are the CAD files in STEP and original SolidWorks.

I tried to make these modules as simple as possible, and still ended to with over 50 lines in the BOM.\n\nThe biggest cost drivers are in order:\n\nMotors (can’t do anything about it)\n\nCancoder (not many cheaper options yet)\n\nMiter gear pair (not likely to get cheaper)\n\nX-contact bearing (could change to 80x100mm bearing, but mounting becomes harder)\n\nWheel\n\nThose five alone take you to $250 before you machine anything!\n\nThe COTS options are great, and come with the added benefit of being able to reuse them year over year without breaking the rules.

Just because “most” teams have these parts already, doesn’t mean every team does. There are also a number of teams that purchase new wheels and motors each year.\n\nFor the purposes of comparing swerve designs/solutions, I think having everything listed is the right way to go. Just about every swerve design out right now (especially when focused on price as the bottom line) lists everything on their BOM. Removing these key items from the BOM only lowers the price artificially IMO (if I can remove motors/wheels from this BOM, I can do it on every other one. Therfore the difference in price between modules doesn’t change).\n\nFrom here, if a team decides they don’t need or already have certain components, they can adjust the BOM themselves.",

Just because “most” teams have these parts already, doesn’t mean every team does. There are also a number of teams that purchase new wheels and motors each year.\n\nSorry, I don’t mean YOU should take the parts off the BOM (wrote my last response too fast)\n\nI meant more for teams who are considering this. A serve drive IS going to cost more than say a 6-wheel tank, but there’s a cost there that is already being paid for by most teams.  OP said each serve will cost around $350, so $1400. Aside from kit-bot teams, teams should figure out how much they’re already spending on gearboxes, ~4 motors/controllers, wheels, and other stuff.\n\nNeos + controllers (OP’s items) $125 x 4 Toughbox minis (cheaper end for gearboxes) $86 x 2 4\" highgrip wheels $8 x 6\n\nThere’s $720 without bearings, chain/belts, and pullies/sprockets. I think our last build was about $900 for the drivetrain. So for another $500 we could have tried swerve.",

More so if it shifts or runs 6 motors or other options.\n\nThe big downside to swerve for many teams is that there’s a threshold of minimum functionality that’s much higher than skid steer. A poorly done skid steer probably still works. A poorly done swerve less so. So there’s more risk.\n\nSo wish people would compare apples to apples for costs more often though.",
