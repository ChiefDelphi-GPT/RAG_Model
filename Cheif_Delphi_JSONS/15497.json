Plus it’s hard to say what the lightning will be like at every competition, so tuning your HSV/RGB values can only get you so far.\n\nA better option is to use some context to help inform your target. You’re looking for a specific string of targets, not just the presence of lights. Both Limelight and PhotonVision have included “targets” in the past to help match the pattern. I think they use OpenCV’s solvepnp, but in the world of computer vision there are other options like template matching or something like hough lines. Or you could really go into the deep end and train a ML model. Kudos to any team who goes there.\n\nI’d be interested to see if Limelight or PhotonVision come out with targets this year. That would probably help without a ton of effort. The other option I can think of (that doesn’t require a ton of vision code) would be to do some light “localization”. AKA, keep track of the general direction of the goal and trust targets that are in that general direction. Not perfect, but a thought.",

                    "cooked": "Limelight filtering has lots of different tools that can get the job done, despite having lights in the background. Last year we competed in the Alamo dome at Texas cup, and there were ceiling lights, dozens of screens surrounding the stadium that looked like lights, etc. Really hard conditions, yet with the correct limelight settings, we saw none of it!\n\nA few items to consider in the settings when tuning:\n\nAspect ratio - this one is in my opinion the easiest way to eliminate unwanted sources. For each target on the top of the upper hub, we know the length and width of the retroflective tape. By taking the ratio of the width to height of the tape, we can get an expected ratio of the blobs of pixels in the limelight. Add maybe 10% on either side of that target to get a range which will accommodate a slight rotation of each tape mark. Now long overhead lights won’t get picked up, and neither will small bulbs.\n\nFill percentage (referred to as convex hull) - this won’t matter as much this year, but last year did wonders. What this means is it takes the bounding box of the pixels (which will be a rectangle) and calculate the percentage of pixels the limelight sees vs the pixels of the bounding rectangle. For not rectangle targets this does incredible things. This year our targets are rectangles, therefore we want to look at targets that are greater than 90%. This should eliminate oddly shaped light sources like screens and stuff.\n\nSize filtering - this one is straightforward: only take targets that are within the expected size. Put your robot on the field, and go to your close shooting range and find the area of the vision target. Then go to your furthest shooting range and record the area. That delta (plus maybe 10% on each end) now dictates the minimum and maximum size of your targets. Doing this will eliminate light sources off in the distance, as well as large windows or things in your shop\n\nBy setting just these 3 parameters, you’ll be able to remove tons of unwanted light sources and can get around most vision challenges.\n\nOne thing id like to stress: when initially tuning the Hue, Saturation, and Luminance, I’d fully expect to see extra light sources. Don’t try and tune HSL to remove unwanted sources! Tune as best as you can, THEN go to the parameters I mentioned above - that should finish off your tuning and remove the rest of the targets the limelight is detecting from the raw HSL tuning",
