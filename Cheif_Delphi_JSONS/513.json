                    "cooked": "Hello Everyone!\n\nWe have alot of things in development that I am sure will surprise and interest many of you but before releasing all of that I need to plan out the changes you would love to see in YAGSL . I know we had a few setbacks this year and we have discussed all of our options to make sure these issues never happen again! Here is our current plan for YAGSL to vastly improve everything from delivery to utilization next year!\n\nMonorepo:\n\nYAGSL will follow the lead of WPILib, PhotonVision, and many more projects by centralizing our repositories into 1 with GitHub actions controlling releases. (We used GitHub actions to make every new release this season!)\n\nMore examples!\n\nThe current system of having one GIANT example for the most complex robot is too difficult to navigate, or understand by most new teams so we are switching it up and creating several new examples based off the current one. We will have SwerveDrive with a drive forward autonomous SwerveDrive with drive forward autonomous and vision using PhotonVision for a global pose SwerveDrive with drive forward and vision using limelight for a global pose SwerveDrive using PathPlanner for autonomous SwerveDrive using Pathfinder for autonomous SwerveDrive Field-Oriented and a drive forward autonomous SwerveDrive field-oriented and PathPlanner autonomous SwerveDrive field-oriented and PathPlanner with PhotonVision for global pose SwerveDrive field-oriented and PathPlanner with Limelight for global pose\n\nSwerveDrive with a drive forward autonomous\n\nSwerveDrive with drive forward autonomous and vision using PhotonVision for a global pose\n\nSwerveDrive with drive forward and vision using limelight for a global pose\n\nSwerveDrive using PathPlanner for autonomous\n\nSwerveDrive using Pathfinder for autonomous\n\nSwerveDrive Field-Oriented and a drive forward autonomous\n\nSwerveDrive field-oriented and PathPlanner autonomous\n\nSwerveDrive field-oriented and PathPlanner with PhotonVision for global pose\n\nSwerveDrive field-oriented and PathPlanner with Limelight for global pose\n\nUpdated documentation\n\nThe documentation this year felt out of date with the Shuffleboard update so we will fix that and move all documentation references from Shuffleboard to Elastic; which is my preferred method of setting up YAGSL anyways.\n\nIn-code configuration\n\nIn-code configurations have always been possible but have been very VERY ugly and while I do not like the idea of having a giant java constants file just for your SwerveDrive it should be done with relative ease.\n\nConfiguration classes.\n\nCurrently configuring a swerve drive is done through helper functions inside of SwerveDrive and SwerveModule which was acceptable until it became too large and unwieldy so its time to correct that mistake! I do not want to break existing code so I may have to find a creative way to add depreciation notices to those functions while providing the same functionality and replacing them with a controlling configuration class. I will probably make SwerveDrive and SwerveModule extend a class which modifies the controlling config class for this.\n\nWeb configurator update!\n\nThe existing web configurator was written to be as functional as possible as quickly as possible. It is not pretty; does not warn you when you might have done something wrong; and does not give you as many hints as it should. I aim to improve this to make it easier to use.\n\nDynamic vendordep importing\n\nA test of this is already live, but WE HAVE HEARD AND LISTENED TO YOUR COMPLAINTS ABOUT TOO MANY VENDORDEPS! We are working on a way to dynamically load all vendordeps that way you only need to install what you use! Currently it is only working with ThriftyNova’s.\n\nBetter brushed motor support\n\nRight now brushed motor support is basically undocumented because it has never been tested by me personally, however we will improve brushed motor support to allow for external encoders on azimuth/steering/angle motors that way teams don’t have to rely on any specific setup for brushed motor on modules and can swap it out as needed.\n\nA configuration app!\n\nThis has been in development for a while and might not be released this season but we are actively trying to make this happen still!\n\nI am still on the fence about a few things like allowing gear ratios for absolute encoders; aliases for common swerve module configurations; and more!\n\nPlease respond to this thread with any recommendations for improvements, suggestions!",

There was a fix available, but not published when I CSA ’ed at a Week 4 event. I only knew about it from watching the CSA Slack. By my next event, Week 6, the fix was showing as available in the vendor deps VS Code plugin, but still wouldn’t update (the old Manage Vendor Libraries worked.)\n\nI saw this impact 3 teams Week 4, and 2 teams Week 6. It’s sad to see a team whose robot was dead on the field during a match.\n\nTL;DR; Consider finding a way to get critical fixes published faster. Consider ways for CSA ’s to help teams update without an internet connection.",

I am able to publish via the old way and have it available instantly but I currently do not have any automation to deploy a PR to GitHub - wpilibsuite/vendor-json-repo: WPILib Vendor JSON Repository which is what the vendordep plugin uses. Even if i did it would take some time (a few mins to a few hours) for one of the WPILib maintainers to merge it in.\n\nI would have to differentiate between beta releases and full releases too.\n\nI will try to get some more CD so i can automatically publish a PR to the vendordep-json-repo though.

I found the giant example as a PERFECT skeleton for our team’s code. This was 1.) My team’s first year with swerve, and 2.) My team’s first year with Java. Having the nearly complete code saved us a huge amount of time and work trying to figure out how to use the code. One of my complaints with some of the vendor libraries is that, yes, they do provide examples, but for a team that struggles with software, it was often difficult to know where to place that bit of code. So having everything in context was a huge learning opportunity. I don’t think we would have figured out how to incorporate vision pose updates with photonvision had it not been for the large example.",

Wonderful setup and helps our newcomers easily get to driving\n\nI think there was definitely two things we ran into though:\n\nUnexpected and unclear documentation about the “right way” to handle switching fieldcentric driver input between red and blue side.

Documenting such quirks on the site (and preferably, the configuration tool) would help a lot for discoverability and avoidance of odd hardware combinations.

Documenting such quirks on the site (and preferably, the configuration tool) would help a lot for discoverability and avoidance of odd hardware combinations. We only found this buried in a chief delphi post after effectively pinning down the issue and specifically searching for it to confirm the fault.\n\nUs and FRC3142 saw the same things this year.

First, it seems to be an incredible tool that allowed teams to get going quickly; so mad props are in order. What I’ve been telling my fellow mentors, though, is that it feels like it’s development speed has created some rough edges. The example of the critical update which you had to manually apply is a good example.  But another was when I was working with a YAGSL expert to help a team, and he was concerned that they had used an ‘old’ template to generate their code and that meant they were missing features.\n\nThe constructive advice I would offer is to increase the priority of stability.  That is, it’s more valuable to be reliable and predictable than to have the more features.  Or to have some very clear versioning; so when I go the web site, it says:  “Make sure you only use YAGSL 17.9 Blue compatible templates.”  Or make sure that when you google ‘ YAGSL example code’ the results don’t horrify you.",
