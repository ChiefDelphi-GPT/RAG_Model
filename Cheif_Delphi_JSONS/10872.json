A local team was adding some servos to their manipulator and wanted to control them independently. they were installed to run two mirrored mechanisms on their intake and they saw that it was working correctly. I don’t know exactly what they noticed that clued them into the fact that things weren’t working in exactly the way that they expected, but I do know that at some point they told both of them to do something different but they still did the same thing. A couple steps of debugging later they determined that even after commenting out one of the servos in their code they still did exactly the same thing. and they then unplugged one of them and still, It did the same thing as its counterpart.\n\nIt turned out that they had decided to run both of them on the same power wires and split them again at the other end of the cable harness and they ran the signal wires as a twisted pair. But one of the connectors was improperly assembled and had no connection on the signal wire and as such that wire was floating. as a result the twisted pair acted as a capacitor and caused the disconnected wire to carry the same signal as the one that was properly connected",

Also in 2007 we built 3 speed transmissions to go real fast. We were one of the first people to uncover this bug when testing those 3 speed transmissions, in high gear of course. We were working in a big open shop floor, but at 20+ ft/s you run out of room quick. Unfortunately the first thing the robot hit was at just the perfect height to destroy like eight brand new Victor speed controllers mounted to the test electronics board.",

                    "cooked": "This was our first year going with a brainpan for electronics, and after our two events it’s extremely bent in so many places. In some spots it looks like someone went at it with a hammer, in others it looks like the electronics were yanked at on one side, bending the brainpan where they were mounted. I have no idea what caused this damage, my best guess is the repeated jumps over the charge station but I’m still not sure how that would cause the amount of damage we’re seeing.\n\nI don’t have any pictures, mostly because it was really hard to capture the damage in a picture. It’s not super noticeable until you’re up close. I want to take off the brainpan to look at the damage, but that would involve unplugging everything so it probably won’t happen.",

They touched during sdr I guess, but it still all worked so we were chilling.
