(my opinion)\n\nAm I missing any key advantages of using the LL3G? Would love to hear other perspectives!",

We have things working the way we want them to.\n\nWe don’t think so he increased frequency from going to the LL4 is worth learning and testing something new. There are also risks/bugs with new hardware, and we don’t want to be the ones learning about those in the field. If we find a limitation where the LL4 would be helpful, we might switch, but so far the 3G is fine.\n\nThat said if you are looking to buy something new today, with no experience, the LL4 is a good choice. Its not worth it to try and find a used 3g (other than for financial reasons).",

The opportunity to start a project fully from scratch is much less frequent. Re-doing “working” designs is often not the right answer from a total cost perspective.\n\nThat being said, most FRC teams will see at least some of this “carryover” due to having parts on hand from previous years, and working codebases. Even more now that the rules changed, to allow more prefabricated components.\n\nThese are broad brush strokes.\n\nBut here’s how I see it, flip your question around: Presume that you have a working localization setup using Limelight 3G’s. What exactly is the reason to switch?\n\nThe key is that assumption that current setup works . As long as that does, adding better hardware has no impact on the “change L’s to W’s” metric.\n\nNow, let’s say you instead take that same time and effort and put it into updating to new LL hardware, and put it into automating some tricky tasks for the driver in teleop. That does have some potential to decrease cycle time.\n\nAgain, assuming my LL3G setup works sufficiently for my needs, the engineering answer should be to invest in the latter (teleop automation), not different limelights.",

You’ll get better FPS but that’s really not that important for localization. The internal IMU drifts so much that you end up getting worse estimates by the end of the match than if you just used your robot IMU, which would be functionally identical to the 3G but with higher FPS.\n\nThis might change with the next update, but without a solid ETA we’re not counting on it.\n\nMohammed:\n\nLimelight 4 allows for object detection, but LL3G alone lacks Coral USB Accelerator support.\n\nSorta the same thing here, not really in its current state in any way that’s much better. The LL4 also doesn’t support coral, and they have no plans to release a hailo compatible model with the next update according to their changelog. Converting a model for a hailo on your own is a massive pain as far as I know. I don’t know if any community member has actually done it yet. So for object detection you’re really limited to CPU models or a LL3 + coral.\n\nBasically, I wouldn’t call the 3G obsolete just yet. If you have them, you won’t really gain anything from upgrading right now.",
