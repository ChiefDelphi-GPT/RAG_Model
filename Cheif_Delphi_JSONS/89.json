                    "cooked": "Hi!  \nPartially inspired by some discussion on the REV product release thread, I’ve designed and assembled a prototype locking system for the MAXPlanetary. This is a V2 of the design, and I’m sure there are many more iterations to come as we test it further. Right now, I’ve only designed a clockwise ratchet, but I plan to design a counter-clockwise ratchet and a break. This is also designed to be as simple to make as possible and very easy to just slap onto an existing mechanism.  \n\nThis adds ~1\" in height and ~0.5\" in width, which in my opinion packages really nicely. We might try and run this at a few offseasons for a climb with our elevator, so more testing will come soon! Also, I want to test the max load it can handle. I’ll do that once I get access to the shop.  \n\nA servo and spring linkage activate the ratchet, deciding whether it is on or off. It is an attachment that goes between the input stage of a MAXPlanetary and the motor powering the MAXPlanetary. Since it is located before the input stage, it is 1:1 to the NEO and doesn’t need to be very strong to stop the motor from being back-driven.  \n\nThis can have a ton of possible uses, and I’m excited to see what people think of! However, the main use case is to put it on a climber. Many endgames in FIRST Robotics Competition require a robot to stay off the ground for a number of seconds, and when your climber backdrives you can lose climb points. In the past, the main way to prevent this was gear really high so the friction stops it from backdriving. However, a climber that is geared really high is also really slow. So, by using this you can have a fast climber that also doesn’t backdrive.  \n\nHere’s a youtube video that gives a general overview of the design, and assembly instructions: [Video Link]. Here’s another youtube video that gives a detailed demonstration: [Video Link]. If 111 is able to, this attachment should allow us to climb and stay climbed with our elevator once we add hooks. I’m looking forward to exploring this in the offseason.  \n\nAn example of how it would look on our lift is attached below. I’m looking forward to hearing questions, comments, and suggestions!",

One obstacle to consider is drilling a clearance hole in the 1/2-inch hex MAX Planetary input adapter, which would likely complicate fabrication. Without this adjustment, the NEO cannot fit further downward, limiting current dimensions. By making this modification, the entire design could potentially be made more compact without altering the input stage. Additionally, designing a 3D-printed support structure for the motor and pawl with sufficient strength using only two bolts is another consideration. I'm unsure if this approach would be robust enough. Finally, redesigning the entire system would require significant time. I'd prefer to refine the design thoroughly before moving forward, especially since the length of the MAX Planetary isn't critical for packaging in most applications.",

Not quite a limit switch, but still gives active positional feedback (that could connect into a SPARK MAX/Flex data port and send signals to the RIO).",

Given that a fall during a climb could severely damage the robot, extreme reliability is crucial. Requiring a limit switch implies a design flaw, as it should already be fail-safe without additional components.\n\nHowever, if feedback is desired, an analog feedback microservo from Taiga could serve as a straightforward replacement. Adding a limit switch introduces extra points of failure, increases complexity, and raises the Bill of Materials (BOM) cost, currently around $25 per unit excluding printed parts.",

However, printed parts may have insufficient torque-transmitting capacity, making it challenging to achieve adequate holding power. Cross-pinning might be possible, though it can be cumbersome. Care must be taken to avoid aligning the pin with the shaft hole, particularly when dealing with splined adapters.",
