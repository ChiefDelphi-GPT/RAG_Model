Our mission at competitions is to go out and assist teams at the event and make sure every robot is playing at its best. Nobody likes having a robot that dies on the field , having mechanisms that aren’t working the way we had hoped , or generally just being unreliable . I’ve been there and it’s not fun (at least for me). In that spirit, here is a list of the most common things that our crew saw and helped teams with, and what we did or recommend doing about it. My goal is to make this a useful resource for teams before their first events. Sorry in advance for the novel!\n\nBumpers Gaps: make sure your bumpers meet the rules about exposed sections of frame perimeter. This year the rule was 0.5” and we had to make 1” wide bumper segments multiple times this season. Mounting: design them in from the beginning! It is hard to do as an afterthought. Rivet-nuts and bolts are an easy and relatively robust solution that is my default implementation at events. This video is similar, but normally we just bolt the bumper down directly into the nut. The permanent stud method can also be achieved with a regular nut or preferably a nylock nut in place of the rivet nut. Reversible bumpers: I don’t recommend them. There is convenience to not having to remove your bumpers between matches, but if you commit to the reversible style, they really need to be well executed and done before the competition. Flappy bits: make sure the flaps are fully secured and cannot catch on field elements/other robots/the floor. On several robots, we ended up stapling the colors down each time and pulling the staples to change colors between matches Weight: extra fabric in reversible bumpers can push teams over the weight limit, requiring creative solutions for weight reduction Repairs: they are harder to fix at competitions than regular bumpers. Taping tears can be more complex\n\nGaps: make sure your bumpers meet the rules about exposed sections of frame perimeter.

Fragile encoder/halls wires : these need to be handled with care and not pulled from the wires. I learned what a disconnected/intermittent motor phase connection sounds like on a NEO this year, it sounds like gears grinding as the motor jumps back and forth as it tries to spin. Not really actionable info here, just a tip for those debugging robots, make sure all of the phases are connected solidly. Sparks friction fit connectors for CAN and the halls/encoder: this is a pretty common failure point and we strongly encourage teams to hot glue in these connectors.\n\nLosing settings/configs across robot restarts/power cycles: usually our solution was to replace the motor controller and that would resolve the issue\n\nController stopped responding entirely: not sure the root cause so we would replace the controller and the new one would work with the same configs/settings.\n\nFragile encoder/halls wires : these need to be handled with care and not pulled from the wires.\n\nI learned what a disconnected/intermittent motor phase connection sounds like on a NEO this year, it sounds like gears grinding as the motor jumps back and forth as it tries to spin.

Wobbly shafts : the most robust use we saw was them mounted directly to a hex shaft constrained on both sides of the motor. Controller lock ups: Only really remember seeing this once, but a motor/controller was not responding (including status lights) and a robot reboot fixed the issue.\n\nI didn’t see that many of these used this year, so not a lot to report here.\n\nWobbly shafts : the most robust use we saw was them mounted directly to a hex shaft constrained on both sides of the motor.\n\nController lock ups: Only really remember seeing this once, but a motor/controller was not responding (including status lights) and a robot reboot fixed the issue.\n\nKrakens Current limits: make sure the current limits are low enough that the robot isn’t browning out by the end of the match Screw terminals: loose screws on either the CAN or power lines cause issues. There is a torque spec from WCP that can help\n\nCurrent limits: make sure the current limits are low enough that the robot isn’t browning out by the end of the match\n\nScrew terminals: loose screws on either the CAN or power lines cause issues.

There are a lot of great off-the- shelf kits these days that make it relatively simple to put together a functional climber. They are all pretty similar and have similar issues. Gearing: make sure the gearbox has both enough torque to lift the robot and also enough to prevent the robot from dropping within the 5 second window at the end of the match. This was usually accomplished via adding stages or swapping out planetary gearboxes. Also make sure your motors are in brake mode! This helps a lot. Ropes snapping: especially with that high-torque climbing system, ropes going over sharp edges of metal will fray and cut quickly. Make sure that the rope is running on pulleys and not just sliding over the edge of a hole . CG vs lifting point: if the climber is not over CG of the robot, the robot will pivot until it is so (unless you have a reaction point). Make sure that the climber behaves the way you expect in testing Binding/friction: sometimes these fail to extend either due to over clamped hardware or bent parts after taking a hard knock. Some grease and checking clamping forces is usually all that’s needed to sort this out.\n\nThis was our most common subsystem to work with teams on this year.

It is beneficial to put the mating velcro on the underside of your driver station console to prevent it from coming off of the wall when the wall gets hit and shakes Power: bring the laptop charger to the field every time. Always have your driver station plugged into power during every match so the laptop never dies.\n\nThere is velcro on the driver stations at the field .

Use loctite : loose screws causes modules to shift or fall apart entirely Grease your gears : proper greasing ensures your gears will last as long as possible Don’t skip critical components : spacers, plates, snap rings, and hardware are all critical components and need to be there to keep your modules running smoothly\n\nMaintenance: while I love the prevalence of COTS swerve modules, they do still need maintenance.

I have seen a remarkable number of robots with at least the top bearing (for the gearbox cluster shaft) falling out because it has been installed backwards.\n\nBoth bearing flanges should end up inside the drive gearbox so they cannot fall out.

Frame rails :  bring spares of your (usually 1x2) frame rails! We upped ours (on 254) to 1x3 this year and had a solid 1x1 bar across the front of our intake behind the bumper to reinforce it. I know other teams had solid 1x1s or 1x2s to do the same thing. (our frame rail from last year , didn’t find any good pics from this year) If you can remove your bent frame rail, it can often be straightened in the machine shop at least once. We occasionally would even then re-install the frame rails backwards so they bowed out instead of in and then a few matches later it would be mostly straight. Intake rollers: same thing goes here, anything exposed to other robots will get bent, broken, and beat up.\n\nThis last one is hard to be specific about, but as the robots get more powerful and faster we see a lot of bent drivetrain rails and exploded/bent intakes.\n\nFrame rails :  bring spares of your (usually 1x2) frame rails!

We recommend soldering all of your CAN connections except where necessary for robot serviceability. The terminating resistor coming loose can also cause “weird” CAN issues that can be hard to track down. If you are having trouble isolating the issue in the chain, check the connection to your resistor.\n\nLoose connections are the biggest issues here and the hardest to find.

A loose battery or main breaker screw connection can lead to disconnects and robots sitting dead on the field. Main breaker cover : side note, make sure the main breaker is protected from being hit by stray game pieces, robots doing the wrong things, and just general debris ( alt design )\n\nGotta make sure all of those connections are really locked down well.

Slow rubbing on moving components is also hazardous . Examples of properly constrained wires .

A couple notes for them are: They don’t last forever, there is a finite number of cycles latching and unlatching before they wear out They are actually only rated for 30A so just be mindful. That said, I have never seen issues, even when they are the power connections for Krakens\n\nThese are more of a solution than a problem, I love them for quick fixes and they work great in FRC .

Alternatively you can use a bracket and bolt Old batteries: these new more powerful motors really want to use the max power from the battery. Most manufacturers recommend replacing batteries after 3 years.\n\nZip tie your primary battery connector ! Yes we cut it every match or use a reusable zip tie.

Electrical tape is the easiest thing to do to prevent metal shavings getting in there and wreaking havoc on your rio.\n\nDrop testing: this isn’t an issue, more of a diagnosis tool that I wanted to share. We drop our own robot and anyone else’s who is having issues. We take one side at a time and lift it up about 6” from a hard floor. With people watching all of the relevant status lights (radio, rio, CAN , motor controllers, encoders, etc) the robot gets dropped 3-4 times per side. Ideally this is done while connected to the driver station and usually while enabled (with someone ready to hit the disable key). This provides maximum information to the people debugging the robot when any statuses change.",

One area which I think which a lot of teams struggle with is designing their bots for stiffness. Impacts with other robots have gotten worse with the introduction of motors with high torques leading to impacts with higher energies. Designing your robot to be stiff and handle these forces is one way to limit damage.\n\nMy advice generally for teams is have a dedicated time to just look at your CAD and try to consider what would happen if a robot at peak acceleration hit your mechanism and wonder if it would survive. If it does great if not take some times and try to design it be able to to somewhat handle the impact better.\n\nThere’s not a fixed list of what to look for but from my experience I look at joints, fasteners, supports.",

They put Velcro on our laptop. Except it was the wrong type of Velcro. So it was soft on soft. Our laptop fell off after a hard hit from the other alliance\n\nOn a serious note, thank you so much for your help.

We had no chassis damage across 2 regionals and champs on regular maxtube. To be fair we didn’t have an under bumper intake, which contributed to much of the damage found on other bots.
