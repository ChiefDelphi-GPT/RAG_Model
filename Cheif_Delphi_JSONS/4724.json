                    "cooked": "Firstly, everything on the Talon FX operates in terms of mechanism rotations, not rotor degrees. That means that if MagicMove takes degrees right now, you need to convert that to rotations (divide by 360.0), or otherwise just take rotations. Additionally, if you set the SensorToMechanismRatio (which you currently do), you don’t need to multiply your input to MotionMagic by your gear ratio, as we expect mechanism rotations (after the SensorToMechanismRatio).\n\nGiven that, your Motion Magic configs and PID gains are also off from what they should be. For Motion Magic configs, the max possible cruise velocity for a Kraken X60 is 100.0 / sensor to mech ratio . So I would probably set your cruise velocity to 3.5 mechanism RPS (~90.0 rps / 25.0) to give yourself some headroom.\n\nFrom there, acceleration depends on how long you want the profile to take to reach max velocity. If you want it to take about half a second, then acceleration should be double your cruise velocity. For 0.2 s, it should be 5x your cruise velocity.\n\nJerk is optional, but if you want to include it for smoother motion, a good starting point is around 10x your acceleration, which means the acceleration would take 0.1 s to reach the max.\n\nAs for your PID gains, your kS is fine, but your other gains are going to be far too weak in terms of mechanism rotations. For a SensorToMechanismRatio of 25, I would expect a kV of 2.75 and a kP of around 50-100 for reference. You can use SysId to find your gains, otherwise you can manually tune them. If you use SysId, make sure your SensorToMechanismRatio is applied before you run the test.",

The SensorToMechanismRatio applies even when not using an external encoder; for an external encoder 1:1 with the mechanism, you would typically use the RotorToSensorRatio instead.\n\nsaahilsterr:\n\nAdditionally, Those values I’ve recieved are from SysID.\n\nThose look like the values SysId would report prior to setting SensorToMechanismRatio = 25 , so I would recommend re-running the test with that config applied. SensorToMechanismRatio impacts the reported position/velocity and, as a result, the gains calculated by SysId.\n\nsaahilsterr:\n\nthe motor is free spinning\n\nThat would also result in lower values, the values you have are close to what I would expect for SensorToMechanismRatio = 1 and a free-spinning motor. With that said, under the “Feedback Analysis” portion, make sure you select the “ CTRE Phoenix 6” preset, as doing so can give you stronger kP and kD gains thanks to the faster onboard PID .\n\nsaahilsterr:\n\nEverytime I turn off and turn on the robot it resets the rotations to 0. After continuos cycling between different set points the error rate gets higher.\n\nFor the reboot issue, the only way around that is to either have an absolute encoder on the system (which is easy for an arm but not something like an elevator), or have a zeroing procedure, such as using limit switches to reset the position. As for the general error while driving the motor, I believe that just comes down to the PID gains being too weak to close the loop on the error with your current configs.",
