Our team has been running SDS swerve modules for the last 4 seasons —Mk4 and MK4is — and they’ve definitely treated us well. But as we start prepping for the next seasons, we’re seriously considering a switch.
\n
We’re currently comparing:
\n•\tWCP X2-ST
\n•\tSDS MK4N
\n
If you’ve used either (or both), we’d love to hear your thoughts. Especially on:
\n•\tDurability and maintenance across multiple events
\n•\tDriving feel and performance under defense
\n•\tEncoder setup (we use CANcoders for absolute position)
\n•\tPackaging or mounting differences
\n•\tAny “we wish we knew this earlier” moments
\n
We’re not switching just for fun — we want to make a call based on real-world value for performance, reliability, and maintenance effort.

Original: I’m a big fan of Swerve X and my team plans on sticking to it. However after seeing the MK5 I honestly think it’s the way to go. There’s a whole lot of serviceability built into it that is very cool, and the covering of it means there’s going to be a whole lot less debris stuck in the gears. However that’s just my opinion and it does not take account for budget or the cost of the MK5 since it is yet to be announced

The next most important thing is did you read the manual and apply locktite and grease where you are supposed to. in my dumb opinion, while pricy, the easiest way to a controlled, battery sipping drive is ctre motors on both drive and steer, pigeon 2, canivore, and a pro license. Then ctre swerve generator + advantage kit sketch. we have tried every combo of wcp, rev, and sds, and both rev motors and ctre motors, and even just krakens on all motors was significantly easier

Original: tbh I would wait for the mk5 that sds showcased at the championship. Looks so much smaller than the mk4n and also supports 2in wide tread that comes with wcp swerve. Also from the photos of mk5 comes with a swerve cover that covers the gear and it also covers the bevel gear so that no carpet can get into the bevel gear

Original: If you have financial difficulties, it would be better to buy a mk4i to mk4n conversion kit. If the necessary finance can be provided, I recommend wcp modules because they are faster than sds modules and do not have belt problems (such as belt breakage) that occur in sds modules. The only point I can say is worse than sds is that repairing the modules is more difficult than sds. and cancoder can also be used
