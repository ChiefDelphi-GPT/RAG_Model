This year, we relied \\u003cem\\u003eheavily\\u003c/em\\u003e on localization for teleop and autonomous, for both pathing corrections, aiming for shooting to the speaker from distance, and aiming for shuttling game pieces.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eEven with the variations from the field, we had good results throughout the season. By champs, we were trusting tags up to 6m away (with 2 or more tags). We eventually fixed our auton launcher accuracy issues by champs, but these were not caused by vision. Pathing corrections worked great, and we were able to pick up game pieces, even with a slightly narrow intake, and even after taking some large hits at the center line. Our teleop accuracy was great through all of our events.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe fallback option for single tag of ‘closet to previous pose’ performed better than ‘closest to gryo’ in our testing. No issues here.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eBy the end of the season, mrcal results were very good for the lens that came with the Arducam. The calibration tool showing when corners are detected, and where they are detected is great. It can be a bit hard to figure out lighting and why its not showing, but getting the feedback of when corners \\u003cem\\u003eare\\u003c/em\\u003e detected, makes this process very smooth.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eBeing able to pull the images and run the mrcal command line tools, while not exactly easy or approachable here, was a nice fallback option to verify results. We stopped using this by the end of the season.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eThe Bad\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003ePerformance of ~15fps and ~45ms latency at full resolution was workable, but still not great. Not exactly a photonvision thing, but worth noting.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eChanging camera settings for a pipeline is clumsy and slow most of the time. Sometimes it requires restarting the service. This is confusing if you change the shutter speed, think its good, then reboot, and it becomes way too low.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eFiltering tags and getting good results without outliers is actually kind of difficult, and requires some level of understanding and skill. Mechanical Advantage’s thread for this is very good.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe NT results data can be useful, but it can be difficult to debug what happened during a match, for example, why was a tag not captured at some point in time? Or why is the pose stability suddenly a problem? What I am looking for here is having all video data recorded for playback after a match.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eThe Ugly\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe story for how settings work as it stands today is difficult to understand. What I am looking for here is to have a main PC, a backup PC, some amount of cameras that are calibrated, and some amount of pre-calibrated spares. All of these should be interchangeable. The way we operated this year is each camera is given a name, and the serial changed through the Arducam UI to this name. However:\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eIt took way too long to realize that clicking on the calibration was how to export and import calibrations. This is a different location than \\u003cem\\u003eother\\u003c/em\\u003e settings import.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eI can see why you wanted calibration images to live alongside the calibration itself, however the json becomes way to large and unwieldy. Uploading back to the device can fail, since there is a cap of 50MB. Checking this into version control makes git sad.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eThe other settings export and import was similarly fragile, especially when calibrated images are stored here. The exported zip has a bunch of files, and when you go to \\u003cem\\u003eimport\\u003c/em\\u003e settings again back to the device, there are \\u003cem\\u003e5\\u003c/em\\u003e different options. I assume ‘All Settings’ is the zip file? What is hardware configs and hardware settings? What is the format for the others? Lastly, the same 50MB limit is present for the settings, which is easy to surpass. Can I just nuke the files over scp on the device if its too big? (You don’t have to answer these here, just highlighting the thought process).\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe ended up just configuring two PCs manually to be similar to each other, and manually import camera calibration. We also wrote a basic script to strip out all the images from the json so it could be imported and checked into revision control.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe continue to have the issue where we see ‘Input was empty!’ in the journalctl, but without warning in the API (e.g. heartbeat continues). We had a bug earlier on this, but this was not resolved. Our solution for this was drive team checking manually. Haven’t had time yet to report on Github.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eViewing the image from the camera for tuning, calibration, or feedback is painfully slow and laggy. With some cameras it could be as low as \\u0026lt;1fps and several seconds of latency, even when plugged directly into the PC. To mitigate this, all calibration was done on a specific laptop, which go \\u003cem\\u003eokay\\u003c/em\\u003e feedback, but never was smooth for us.\\u003c/p\\u003e\",\"post_number\":2,\"post_type\":1,\"posts_count\":24,\"updated_at\":\"2024-04-24T20:06:16.733Z\",\"reply_count\":0,\"reply_to_post_number\":null,\"quote_count\":0,\"incoming_link_count\":11,\"reads\":551,\"readers_count\":550,\"score\":225.2,\"yours\":false,\"topic_id\":464375,\"topic_slug\":\"photonvision-2024-feedback\",\"display_username\":\"Will Toth\",\"primary_group_name\":null,\"flair_name\":null,\"flair_url\":null,\"flair_bg_color\":null,\"flair_color\":null,\"flair_group_id\":null,\"badges_granted\":[],\"version\":1,\"can_edit\":false,\"can_delete\":false,\"can_recover\":false,\"can_see_hidden_post\":true,\"can_wiki\":false,\"read\":true,\"user_title\":\"\",\"bookmarked\":false,\"actions_summary\":[{\"id\":2,\"count\":4}],\"moderator\":false,\"admin\":false,\"staff\":false,\"user_id\":6349,\"hidden\":false,\"trust_level\":2,\"deleted_at\":null,\"user_deleted\":false,\"edit_reason\":null,\"can_view_edit_history\":true,\"wiki\":false,\"user_custom_fields\":{\"user_field_4\":\"FRC 3005 Mentor\"},\"post_url\":\"/t/photonvision-2024-feedback/464375/2\",\"custom_user_title\":\"FRC 3005 Mentor\",\"reactions\":[{\"id\":\"heart\",\"type\":\"emoji\",\"count\":4}],\"current_user_reaction\":null,\"reaction_users_count\":4,\"current_user_used_main_reaction\":false,\"can_accept_answer\":false,\"can_unaccept_answer\":false,\"accepted_answer\":false,\"topic_accepted_answer\":null},{\"id\":3372708,\"name\":\"Natalie Daleo\",\"username\":\"Natalie5431\",\"avatar_template\":\"/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/n/91b2a8/{size}.png\",\"created_at\":\"2024-04-24T21:19:43.113Z\",\"cooked\":\"\\u003cp\\u003eThank you for developing Photonvision, it really helped us out on our second year using it.

We read a few GitHub issues and learned that we needed to use a camera renamer tool. However, Photon did not accept it! When we plugged in the camera to any other device, Mac or Windows, it listed the correct name (AmpCam). But Photon refused, listing both cameras as the same default name. Even when the other one was unplugged, it started naming it “ArduCam (1)(1)(1)(1)(1)(1)(1)(1)(1)(1)(1)(1)(1)(1)” etc. We ran out of time fighting it so ended up only using one of those cameras.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eUgly\\u003c/strong\\u003e: 3D Calibration was absolutely awful.

But turns out, the reported pitch and yaw values were wrong! We had to fit a polynomial curve by measuring out distance from a target and calculating the correct pitch. After doing all that, we were able to get accuracy within a few centimeters. There was a lot of frustration involved in a process that’s advertised to be nearly automatic.\\u003c/p\\u003e\",\"post_number\":6,\"post_type\":1,\"posts_count\":24,\"updated_at\":\"2024-04-25T18:58:19.786Z\",\"reply_count\":0,\"reply_to_post_number\":null,\"quote_count\":0,\"incoming_link_count\":2,\"reads\":334,\"readers_count\":333,\"score\":91.8,\"yours\":false,\"topic_id\":464375,\"topic_slug\":\"photonvision-2024-feedback\",\"display_username\":\"Luke
