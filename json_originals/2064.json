Our team requires safety tests to be completed before students can run any machines. Last year I preferred to go machine by machine with new team members, running through each machine in a bit more detail so they have the context to understand what these tests are asking. These serve as a good introduction to the machines themselves, too.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eOnce all new members have been through this process, we start having rookies work with a veteran or mentor one-on-one to learn how to run each machine. We prioritize teaching the more commonly used machines first. We try to make sure that all of our fabrication rookies feel comfortable running these machines before their first build season. Our CAD team has previously made practice drawings to teach required processes that we use annually. We also have a few drawings to use later on that are more similar to common parts that we see during build season if anyone progresses through their training more quickly. This year we will start to keep a document to keep track of how everyone feels about their abilities for every machine so we know what we need to work on training more and if we need more practice drawings to be made.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eIf anyone is interested in learning CNC, we would also try to teach it during this time during pre season. We currently have a very limited number of team members with this knowledge. For training this, we start with the online training course through Haas, whose CNC machines we use. This course is free online, and covers the basics of CNC mills or lathes. After this is done, a mentor or veteran who knows the machine would help teach with another practice part, like a shorter version of a frame rail. It is currently a bit of a struggle trying to find time to teach this since we usually stay busy all the way until kickoff.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAnother part of our training is basically safety protocols, which are covered right away with the safety tests. There is a tests that covers this, but we also talk about proper safety very often and give reminders whenever necessary so everyone learns fast. At the same time, we teach the basics of our shop other than the machines, like how to use a caliper, all about tolerances, and how to read a drawing. Last year and the year before, we taught drawings along with our CAD team so there were clear expectations for both groups about making, reading, and organizing drawings.\\u003c/p\\u003e\",\"post_number\":3,\"post_type\":1,\"posts_count\":5,\"updated_at\":\"2025-07-22T04:35:02.246Z\",\"reply_count\":0,\"reply_to_post_number\":null,\"quote_count\":0,\"incoming_link_count\":4,\"reads\":143,\"readers_count\":142,\"score\":63.6,\"yours\":false,\"topic_id\":500413,\"topic_slug\":\"manufacturing-training-for-new-students\",\"display_username\":\"\",\"primary_group_name\":null,\"flair_name\":null,\"flair_url\":null,\"flair_bg_color\":null,\"flair_color\":null,\"flair_group_id\":null,\"badges_granted\":[],\"version\":1,\"can_edit\":false,\"can_delete\":false,\"can_recover\":false,\"can_see_hidden_post\":true,\"can_wiki\":false,\"read\":true,\"user_title\":\"\",\"bookmarked\":false,\"actions_summary\":[{\"id\":2,\"count\":1}],\"moderator\":false,\"admin\":false,\"staff\":false,\"user_id\":67231,\"hidden\":false,\"trust_level\":2,\"deleted_at\":null,\"user_deleted\":false,\"edit_reason\":null,\"can_view_edit_history\":true,\"wiki\":false,\"user_custom_fields\":{\"user_field_4\":\"chronically tired fabrication lead\"},\"post_url\":\"/t/manufacturing-training-for-new-students/500413/3\",\"custom_user_title\":\"chronically tired fabrication lead\",\"reactions\":[{\"id\":\"heart\",\"type\":\"emoji\",\"count\":1}],\"current_user_reaction\":null,\"reaction_users_count\":1,\"current_user_used_main_reaction\":false,\"can_accept_answer\":false,\"can_unaccept_answer\":false,\"accepted_answer\":false,\"topic_accepted_answer\":null},{\"id\":3687521,\"name\":\"philso\",\"username\":\"philso\",\"avatar_template\":\"/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/p/e68b1a/{size}.png\",\"created_at\":\"2025-07-23T03:22:10.656Z\",\"cooked\":\"\\u003cp\\u003eLast fall semester, after all the safety training, we used the following \\u003ca href=\\\"https://cad.onshape.com/documents/a154d3be43785c498bb00197/w/fbd57e112d333763cbf53360/e/41455e95931dd09f6dbdaecc?renderMode=0\\u0026amp;uiState=68804af6cfca421cdcb4d1b9\\\" rel=\\\"noopener nofollow ugc\\\"\\u003eWood Works\\u003c/a\\u003e and \\u003ca href=\\\"https://cad.onshape.com/documents/4d18b7aad758d636fd13b204/w/deb849d6980ae44e64031f64/e/b6398694f3b147c1906e75f1?renderMode=0\\u0026amp;uiState=68804e3263c83518afbfe62a\\\" rel=\\\"noopener nofollow ugc\\\"\\u003eMetal Works\\u003c/a\\u003e exercises to train our 50 new students (about 100 total).

We got parents to come to our shop to be “shop supervisors” to oversee the training exercises and be the “responsible adult in the room”. We made it clear that no prior knowledge of robotics was needed to serve as a shop supervisor. After a few weeks, some of the parents were actually helping the students by correcting them when they saw they were doing something wrong.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eStarting from last season, we required all build team members (Mechanical and Electrical) to acquire some basic level of ability in OnShape. We want them to be able to take measurements for themselves and to be able to see how parts go together so that the Technical Design group members can focus on doing design work.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe have all the build team members work through these exercises. It has been a revelation to be able to ask a student, during build season, to go make a part out of some type of tube and they come back after a reasonable amount of time with the part made correctly. We did virtually no training after Kickoff.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe various training exercises greatly increased the level of engagement. Even some of the team members who were on the business side wanted to take the training.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe basic training exercises also served as a screening mechanism. Many team members join the team and indicate they want to work in the electrical group or they wanted to run the CNC router. On every team, there are always students who stopped attending build meetings after a month or two. Since the amount of resource invested into any particular student for these training exercises is relatively low, not a lot of resources are lost, compared to training someone to run a CNC router only to have them stop showing up. This prevents wasting the time of the person doing the training. It also allows some other student of the opportunity to take the training.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe also found a few students where they could not pass the first two exercises even after multiple tries. We gently told them that “they are likely to find other areas where it would be easier for them to excel” and directed them into other areas.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eFor some roles, we have only been allowing returning team members to train for those roles. Before being accepted for these roles, the officers and mentors have to agree that the student has shown sufficient dedication, good workmanship, demonstrated that they are teachable, and demonstrated that they have a good attitude. These roles are drive team, electrical, manufacturing (CNC router and 3D printer) and advanced mechanism (serve module, climber assembly and maintenance).\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003ca class=\\\"attachment\\\" href=\\\"/uploads/short-url/uV6VkCmgFuQIEaTAvR17x0URPG0.pdf\\\"\\u003eWood Works 1 Gauge.pdf\\u003c/a\\u003e (22.7 KB)\\u003cbr\\u003e\\n\\u003ca class=\\\"attachment\\\" href=\\\"/uploads/short-url/dXwZwtHr4o15vLiziYla2lxyc0p.pdf\\\"\\u003eWood Works Cutting.pdf\\u003c/a\\u003e (17.0 KB)\\u003cbr\\u003e\\n\\u003ca class=\\\"attachment\\\" href=\\\"/uploads/short-url/sN4ai8jARbffbcR0CBIbtS4cYhA.pdf\\\"\\u003eWood Works Drilling.pdf\\u003c/a\\u003e (17.4 KB)\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003ca class=\\\"attachment\\\" href=\\\"/uploads/short-url/dDHzo3xzqJHnNSu9l97k5LZHmmr.pdf\\\"\\u003eMetal Works 4.pdf\\u003c/a\\u003e (91.1 KB)\\u003c/p\\u003e\",\"post_number\":4,\"post_type\":1,\"posts_count\":5,\"updated_at\":\"2025-07-23T03:22:10.656Z\",\"reply_count\":0,\"reply_to_post_number\":null,\"quote_count\":0,\"incoming_link_count\":17,\"reads\":86,\"readers_count\":85,\"score\":207.2,\"yours\":false,\"topic_id\":500413,\"topic_slug\":\"manufacturing-training-for-new-students\",\"display_username\":\"philso\",\"primary_group_name\":null,\"flair_name\":null,\"flair_url\":null,\"flair_bg_color\":null,\"flair_color\":null,\"flair_group_id\":null,\"badges_granted\":[],\"version\":1,\"can_edit\":false,\"can_delete\":false,\"can_recover\":false,\"can_see_hidden_post\":true,\"can_wiki\":false,\"link_counts\":[{\"url\":\"https://cad.onshape.com/documents/a154d3be43785c498bb00197/w/fbd57e112d333763cbf53360/e/41455e95931dd09f6dbdaecc?renderMode=0\\u0026uiState=68804af6cfca421cdcb4d1b9\",\"internal\":false,\"reflection\":false,\"title\":\"Onshape\",\"clicks\":11},{\"url\":\"https://cad.onshape.com/documents/4d18b7aad758d636fd13b204/w/deb849d6980ae44e64031f64/e/b6398694f3b147c1906e75f1?renderMode=0\\u0026uiState=68804e3263c83518afbfe62a\",\"internal\":false,\"reflection\":false,\"title\":\"Onshape\",\"clicks\":11},{\"url\":\"/uploads/short-url/sN4ai8jARbffbcR0CBIbtS4cYhA.pdf\",\"internal\":true,\"reflection\":false,\"clicks\":0},{\"url\":\"/uploads/short-url/dDHzo3xzqJHnNSu9l97k5LZHmmr.pdf\",\"internal\":true,\"reflection\":false,\"clicks\":0},{\"url\":\"/uploads/short-url/uV6VkCmgFuQIEaTAvR17x0URPG0.pdf\",\"internal\":true,\"reflection\":false,\"clicks\":0},{\"url\":\"/uploads/short-url/dXwZwtHr4o15vLiziYla2lxyc0p.pdf\",\"internal\":true,\"reflection\":false,\"clicks\":0}],\"read\":true,\"user_title\":\"\",\"bookmarked\":false,\"actions_summary\":[{\"id\":2,\"count\":7}],\"moderator\":false,\"admin\":false,\"staff\":false,\"user_id\":15467,\"hidden\":false,\"trust_level\":2,\"deleted_at\":null,\"user_deleted\":false,\"edit_reason\":null,\"can_view_edit_history\":true,\"wiki\":false,\"user_custom_fields\":{\"user_field_4\":\"\"},\"post_url\":\"/t/manufacturing-training-for-new-students/500413/4\",\"custom_user_title\":null,\"reactions\":[{\"id\":\"heart\",\"type\":\"emoji\",\"count\":7}],\"current_user_reaction\":null,\"reaction_users_count\":7,\"current_user_used_main_reaction\":false,\"can_accept_answer\":false,\"can_unaccept_answer\":false,\"accepted_answer\":false,\"topic_accepted_answer\":null},{\"id\":3687627,\"name\":\"George C\",\"username\":\"George_C\",\"avatar_template\":\"/user_avatar/www.chiefdelphi.com/george_c/{size}/156470_2.png\",\"created_at\":\"2025-07-23T13:40:13.045Z\",\"cooked\":\"\\u003cp\\u003eConsider a Tech Proficiency Passport which, for us, serves two purposes.
