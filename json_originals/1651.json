We intentionally chose this robot for a couple of reasons:\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003col\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eWe wanted to be able to do a direct comparison between the roboRIO and the SystemCore. For this we wanted the robot to be as close to identical to our competition robot as possible to reduce external variables.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eIn order to compete with it at off-season competitions, we wanted to put it on one of the two identical robots so that we could test the controller while still being as competitive as we would be normally.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eIt was easy to transfer to the wiring and placement of the SystemCore because the placement of the roboRIO that was already on the robot was very accessible, and it helped to have an already fully functional robot on which we knew all of the systems well beforehand, so that we could more easily see which issues were caused directly by the SystemCore vs the other parts of the robot.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eIf the SystemCore didn’t end up working out for our first offseason competition (Chezy Champs) we would have a backup robot that was nearly identical, making our decision much less time pressured during the weeks leading up to Chezy Champs when we still weren’t sure if it would be viable to bring our Omega robot. This also made it so that we could still hold driver practice while we were debugging any issues on Omega.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ol\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003e\\u003ca name=\\\"p-3754477-electrical-2\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\" href=\\\"#p-3754477-electrical-2\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/a\\u003eElectrical:\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e6/28/25\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe began transferring the wiring from the roboRIO to the SystemCore.

Hence, we tried to create a new project through WPILib VSCode. However, none of the options led to any motion. We decided to consult the other alpha tester teams to see if they had any insight. We consulted 6328’s Chief Delphi Post/Github where they posted videos of their robot driving. We decided to try and use their public SystemCore base code to try to at least get ours to move. This did not work for us. At this point, after trying to create a new project from WPilib VSCode again, we decided that we should just try the way we have done in the past: generating the base via Phoenix Tuner X. After generation, we opened it in the 2027_Alpha Version of VS Code so that we could use the quick import tool to get a swerve drivebase running ASAP. This ended up working out pretty well, and we were able to get the SystemCore robot moving!\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e7/12/25\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eIn preparation for this meeting, we imported C2025 (Our competition robot code base) into the 2027 VS Code version and began the excruciating process of updating API Calls manually.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAlong with the installation of the SystemCore, Omega was retrofitted so that its mechanisms were on par with Comp’s. However, once we deployed this new code base to Omega for the first time, the SystemCore began to crash repeatedly.

The alternative is currently not available. Since this was a roboRIO specific API Call, Java was crashing because it had no idea what we were referencing. For some insight into why we use this, this allows us to lower at what voltage brownout protections kick in. Although this is not on the SystemCore yet, we are hopeful that either a call like this is added so we can lower the threshold or another solution is implemented so that our brownouts kick in later.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThat issue took a while to solve; after that the rest of the meeting was spent on the bring-up of the robot as normal.

However, this was also the point in time when we began to encounter our first major issue with the SystemCore device. Upon powering on, the screen was completely shut off with no display (power cycling the robot did nothing to fix this). Yet, all other functionality of the robot was completely fine, and the shut-off screen seemed to have no effect on the functionality of the device itself.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"lightbox-wrapper\\\"\\u003e\\u003ca class=\\\"lightbox\\\" href=\\\"https://www.chiefdelphi.com/uploads/default/original/4X/b/b/1/bb1020417da19e2c7dd5ba7c623299053a6c359a.jpeg\\\" data-download-href=\\\"https://www.chiefdelphi.com/uploads/default/bb1020417da19e2c7dd5ba7c623299053a6c359a\\\" title=\\\"sys4\\\"\\u003e\\u003cimg src=\\\"https://www.chiefdelphi.com/uploads/default/optimized/4X/b/b/1/bb1020417da19e2c7dd5ba7c623299053a6c359a_2_375x500.jpeg\\\" alt=\\\"sys4\\\" data-base62-sha1=\\\"qGPPSxhmp0WgreV5YnESiGqb8Rs\\\" width=\\\"375\\\" height=\\\"500\\\" srcset=\\\"https://www.chiefdelphi.com/uploads/default/optimized/4X/b/b/1/bb1020417da19e2c7dd5ba7c623299053a6c359a_2_375x500.jpeg, https://www.chiefdelphi.com/uploads/default/optimized/4X/b/b/1/bb1020417da19e2c7dd5ba7c623299053a6c359a_2_562x750.jpeg 1.5x, https://www.chiefdelphi.com/uploads/default/optimized/4X/b/b/1/bb1020417da19e2c7dd5ba7c623299053a6c359a_2_750x1000.jpeg 2x\\\" data-dominant-color=\\\"1E1C14\\\"\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"meta\\\"\\u003e\\u003csvg class=\\\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\"\\u003e\\u003cuse href=\\\"#far-image\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/use\\u003e\\u003c/svg\\u003e\\u003cspan class=\\\"filename\\\"\\u003esys4\\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan class=\\\"informations\\\"\\u003e1200×1600 187 KB\\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003csvg class=\\\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\"\\u003e\\u003cuse href=\\\"#discourse-expand\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/use\\u003e\\u003c/svg\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e7/20/25\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eOn this day, when we turned on Omega in the morning, it booted right up and the screen was on.

All the functionally that was left to test were all our Digital Inputs. This ended up taking a lot longer than we anticipated. We almost immediately ran into an issue, which was that several of the ports that we originally chose to plug our beam breaks and other \\u003cspan class=\\\"abbreviation\\\"\\u003ePWM\\u003ctemplate class=\\\"tooltiptext\\\" data-text=\\\"Pulse Width Modulation\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/template\\u003e\\u003c/span\\u003e-based components into didn’t receive any signal at all. This was quite difficult to initially diagnose, as it was hard to distinguish between a SystemCore issue and what could have been an electrical or connection issue. Initially, the button that we had installed (when pressed, switches all of the motors on the robot between brake and coast, making it easier to move mechanisms when the robot is disabled but on—see C2025 for more info) and our coral end effector beam break both received no signal. Our solution to this (after confirming that the wiring was correct and they were plugged in well) was to change the ports of the components that weren’t working, and after some numerous trials/ shuffling of all 4 \\u003cspan class=\\\"abbreviation\\\"\\u003ePWM\\u003ctemplate class=\\\"tooltiptext\\\" data-text=\\\"Pulse Width Modulation\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/template\\u003e\\u003c/span\\u003e devices we eventually found a solution.

Although this could very well be an issue with wiring or with the button itself, we have attempted several fixes to remedy this issue (including trying a brand-new button and re-crimping the connections to the SystemCore) with no success, leading us to believe that both ports 3 and 4 are non-functional, in addition to the port that the coral end effector beam break was in, 1.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e7/23/25\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eIn addition to finishing the bring-up process of everything and doing a bunch of validation, this meeting was spent trying to figure out what was wrong with all of our scoring. For context, all of our scoring is done on one controller through paddles on the back of the controller. The paddles are bound to the D-pad buttons. When we tried to run any autoscore, the robot would charge at the driver station wall. After a lot of log tracing, we realized that the issue was with the D-pad mappings from the 2027 Alpha 1. However, just as we were about to post, WPILib Alpha 2 was released which patched this issue.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e7/26/25\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWith the patch for the D-pad issues fixed, we overhauled our controls for the D-pad so that they worked with the new API. After that, all our scoring worked perfectly with no issues. We spent this meeting working on a lot of validation and testing. We also began to attempt to run driver practice on the robot so we could find additional issues. Moreover to put hours on Omega before Chezy Champs in September. Unfortunately, we began to encounter issues fairly quickly (see Example 1 below).\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e7/30/25\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eOne of the last things to do on this robot was to get our LEDs working. For some context, we have been using Phoenix 5 on our LED software for the last few years. With the SystemCore not supporting Phoenix 5 at the moment (there are talks in the Github about future support), we were forced to try and migrate all of our LED logic to Phoenix 6. This took a while because our LEDs are fairly embedded and also customized significantly. Nevertheless, we were able to get it working in a usable capacity.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e8/3/25\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThis is when our largest issue with the robot was first noticed—the omega swerve issue. We began troubleshooting every possible cause that we could think of. At around this point, while attempting to solve the issues, we upgraded our SystemCore operating system to the stable version available (Alpha 3 at this point).\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e8/6/25 to 8/22/25\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThis period was spent purely on trying to solve the Omega swerve issue.

Before these days, this robot has less than 6 hours on it since being retrofitted in June due to the Omega swerve issues. On 8/25 we also encountered the extremely dangerous disconnection issue (see \\u003ca href=\\\"https://github.com/wpilibsuite/SystemCoreTesting/issues/176#issue-3462352137\\\" rel=\\\"noopener nofollow ugc\\\"\\u003eGithub Post\\u003c/a\\u003e for more info).
