I’ve been looking at Mechanical Advantage’s code and I like the way they structure their code with their IO subsystems and such, and I like the concept of being able to replay our matches after the fact. I think my problem is I don’t know actually WHAT needs to be coded, we are using an elevator, we have swerve which I just used ctre swerve generator for and then did a little tuning, and we will have a fairly simple algae intake and coral intake.

If you’re interested in talking more in-depth with our programmers (me, and one other person) please reach out to us at \\u003ca href=\\\"mailto:robotics@neiacademy.org\\\"\\u003erobotics@neiacademy.org\\u003c/a\\u003e.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eMy suggestions:\\u003cbr\\u003e\\nFocus on abstracting as much as you can- the less very specific low-level control you have to do, the more it will simplify tasks for you- especially when you’re working during competitions, in the pits.\\u003cbr\\u003e\\nWe implemented 6328’s IO abstraction strategy last year, and it worked pretty well for us- no real issues. We’re continuing to use it this year. I suggest coding the subsystem classes themselves to find what methods you’ll need, then creating interface classes for each subsystem with methods that suit your subsystem class - elevator, algae intake, coral intake - and then coding the specific implementations with the motor type.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eQuestion- are you doing any vision implementation, or auto routines at all? It’s time-consuming- and perhaps not a priority, but this is also something you may want to consider about how you’re going to approach it.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eFor which subsystems to focus on- probably start with the most basic, and then work your way up- but this will probably depend on your specific situation.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eMy suggestion for implementing AdvantageScope - leave it until next year, or between your competitions- don’t focus on it as a priority. In our experience, it’s quite complex to implement this close to the season (we tried about 2-3 weeks out from our first comp) and can end up wasting time.

I’m the colead of the 3414 Hackbots programming team. Here’s my best effort to summarize what I think may help:\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003e\\u003ca name=\\\"p-3501395-h-0-identifydesign-subsystems-1\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\" href=\\\"#p-3501395-h-0-identifydesign-subsystems-1\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/a\\u003e0 - identify/design subsystems\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eJust like the other members of the team, you have to design some subsystems - only in code rather than nuts and bolts.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eIt looks like you already have a good understanding of what you’ll be working with. This is really good.\\u003cbr\\u003e\\nFor each subsystem, you can begin by figuring out what the subsystem needs to control. This includes connected motors, sensors, etc. Make sure that you have read the docs on whatever you may need included. You want an IR sensor? Read the docs? You’re including a motor? Find the docs, then read them.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAs you identify different subsystems, you will amass a lot of information. Write it down somewhere (I personally like markdown, but you do you).\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAfter this, you can start to think about what features your robot code needs. You have an intake. We’ll start there. What features may you need of this “intake”? Does it need a method \\u003ccode\\u003esetIntakeSpeed()\\u003c/code\\u003e? What about \\u003ccode\\u003ehasGamepiece()\\u003c/code\\u003e? At this point, we don’t need syntactically correct code, but rather we need some form of psuedocode that just lets you get your ideas out. Don’t be slowed down by the limitations of Java syntax.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe amount of operations that a subsystem should be responsible for will increase as you design further. But that’s a problem for when you implement more features - later.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003e\\u003ca name=\\\"p-3501395-h-1-shell-subsystems-2\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\" href=\\\"#p-3501395-h-1-shell-subsystems-2\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/a\\u003e1 - shell subsystems\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eOnce you have decided which features and responsibilities your subsystem needs - like \\u003cem\\u003eneeds\\u003c/em\\u003e - we can begin writing some code. It really at this point doesn’t matter how you choose to implement it, in terms of file structure or naming. We just need a basic implementation for what we are looking for. You don’t need to implement the most advanced stuff yet. If you’re looking to get started, we need something in code that technically does what we need. It doesn’t need to do it well - but don’t let that mean that you shouldn’t implement good practices and clever ideas. By all means, make your code nice if you can. But that’s not your very first priority. Getting your code to build and function as expected is a good starting point, especially if it’s just you writing all the code.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003e\\u003ca name=\\\"p-3501395-h-2-designing-commands-3\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\" href=\\\"#p-3501395-h-2-designing-commands-3\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/a\\u003e2 - designing commands\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAfter your subsystems are in place with the obvious operations, we can start to build some commands. Again, just like with the subsystems, you can throw all of your ideas into some psuedocode or markdown. This lets you dump your ideas out and see what works.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWhen designing commands, let’s try to consider the following questions:\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eWhen does this run?\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eWhat assumptions are we making about our robot/code?\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003cbr\\u003e\\nThis is particularly important.

Any methods that it needs, I have. Implementing those is our next step. For now, we pretend like the subsystems can do whatever they should (reasonably) be able to do. Consult step 0 to figure out what the subsystems are physically capable of.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNote\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Don’t forget to call \\u003ccode\\u003eaddRequirements()\\u003c/code\\u003e for your subsystems.

Using the commands as specifications for what your subsystems can do, get to work! Implement whatever features you already deemed necessary for those subsystems, and soon, your subsystems will expand and have so much functionality.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003e\\u003ca name=\\\"p-3501395-h-4-connecting-commands-to-the-robot-6\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\" href=\\\"#p-3501395-h-4-connecting-commands-to-the-robot-6\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/a\\u003e4 - connecting commands to the robot\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eYou’ve written all of your subsystem code and commands! That’s awesome. Now we need a way to trigger those commands. This part is more of a team-specific design choice, so I can’t offer too much advice.\\u003cbr\\u003e\\nBut you can ask yourself these questions to get an idea:\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eDuring what part of the game (auton, teleop, endgame) should this command run?\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eDoes this command run in parallel/sequence with other commands?

You can simulate and trigger IR sensors, and see their effects on the robot.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAfter simulation lets you fix the logical errors in your code, it’s time to connect to an actual bot.

Lots of problems can be averted this way), you can test your code on a real robot. This could be a comp bot, or it could be a roborio connected to some motors with the same IDs. Up to you.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eOne of the biggest pieces of advice our mentors have told is is this:\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003ebreak your code.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eYour programming skills will probably have made sure that in the regular cases, the code works as it should. But find those places where it doesn’t, and break your code. Make the robot misbehave by trying strange things. Make sure your code is robust and can operate in a variety of situations.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eOne thing I’ve learned with robot code is to never assume anything works successfully. In the words of a mentor, “It’s broke until you prove it isn’t.”\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003e\\u003ca name=\\\"p-3501395-h-6-improve-8\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\" href=\\\"#p-3501395-h-6-improve-8\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/a\\u003e6 - improve\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eBy this point, you can relax. Your code works, and you’ve gotten a viable product to your team. But in terms of the code, is it your best work?\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThis is the point where you can look over/review whatever code you’ve written so far. Look for repeated code, or other strange logic. This is where you can be creative and come up with innovative solutions, so go for it!\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eNicer code not only reads better, but also is less of a pain to maintain.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003e\\u003ca name=\\\"p-3501395-h-7-repeat-9\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\" href=\\\"#p-3501395-h-7-repeat-9\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/a\\u003e7 - repeat\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAsk your team what else the robot needs to be able to do.

You serve the team - help them do as good as they can. Give them what they need, not what you think. On the other hand though, bring up new ideas! You can’t know if an idea will be helpful unless you bring it up.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAnd that’s it!

If your code doesn’t look easy to follow, you are either building something inherently complex, or your code can be simplified. Honestly, it’s personal preference. If you can tolerate your code, then there’s no reason to change anything. But if you are writing it, and you think, “But wait! I could be really clever and do it this way…” then that’s a sign that there may be a better way to implement something.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ol\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eA good test would be seeing how easy it is to explain the code to a friend/mentor/yourself. It’s really quite abstract, and it’s more of intuition that you develop that lets you know you can improve it.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eOne example I’ll give is this:\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eMany writes on \\u003cspan class=\\\"abbreviation\\\"\\u003eCAN\\u003ctemplate class=\\\"tooltiptext\\\" data-text=\\\"Controller Area Network\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/template\\u003e\\u003c/span\\u003e traffic are not ideal.

To mitigate unnecessary traffic, you could use some logic inside of the subsystem to keep track of the most recent applied input to the motor. Then, you only apply a new input if it doesn’t match the old.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eReally, refactoring and improvement really should only be considered if you are having problems with you code, because a one man programming squad already has enough to deal with.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eBut if you keep using a subsystem’s method(s) and saying, “Man, this stinks.
