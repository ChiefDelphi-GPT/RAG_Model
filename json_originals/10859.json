However, I’d like to share our experiences with several key components/parts of our 2023 Robot, Anura. Some are great, and some are … mixed.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eFalcon 500 (v3)\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe are feeling very mixed on this particular motor… we have had several QC issues we have noticed and concerns, including:\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eShaft run-out\\u003c/strong\\u003e: We noted on our Swerve X modules all 8 of our initial Falcon 500’s suffered pretty severe shaft runout/wobbly-ness on the output shafts. We ended up using all 8 of our spare replacement Falcon 500’s in between CVR and Sacramento to avoid any potential issues down the line between Sacramento/Champs. This \\u003cem\\u003emay have\\u003c/em\\u003e been exasperated by the belts on our initial Swerve X configuration pulling the shafts into tension but I’ve seen/heard experiences with other FRC teams that have seen the same issue here. It’s not ideal at all to have shaft run-out this bad (where we could visibly see the shaft shifting about .010-.020” off axis), and our team was extremely unhappy with this QC, especially since we couldn’t get replacement spline shafts for the V3 during the season here…\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eGND shorted to motor chassis\\u003c/strong\\u003e: We had one Falcon 500 v3 short its GND line to the chassis of the motor, intermittently (see pic below for disassembled motor). We initially failed our inspection at CVR due to ground-chassis isolation fault, and didn’t \\u003cem\\u003efully\\u003c/em\\u003e fix this issue until discovering one of our falcons on our swerve drive had an initial 3.4k Ohm, that would change resistance upon rotation/disassembly. Pix shows a 13.4k Ohm resistance, but would seemingly change randomly (either OL or some resistance between 3k-20k)… a pain to track down fully until we got back to the lab from CVR.\\u003cbr\\u003e\\n\\u003cdiv class=\\\"lightbox-wrapper\\\"\\u003e\\u003ca class=\\\"lightbox\\\" href=\\\"https://www.chiefdelphi.com/uploads/default/original/3X/3/c/3c44b6ce8825ed38337afb158c90f69d80457ccd.jpeg\\\" data-download-href=\\\"https://www.chiefdelphi.com/uploads/default/3c44b6ce8825ed38337afb158c90f69d80457ccd\\\" title=\\\"image\\\"\\u003e\\u003cimg src=\\\"https://www.chiefdelphi.com/uploads/default/optimized/3X/3/c/3c44b6ce8825ed38337afb158c90f69d80457ccd_2_690x318.jpeg\\\" alt=\\\"image\\\" data-base62-sha1=\\\"8B9RMBBE4k5FeczR8GzXDXkd6cl\\\" width=\\\"690\\\" height=\\\"318\\\" srcset=\\\"https://www.chiefdelphi.com/uploads/default/optimized/3X/3/c/3c44b6ce8825ed38337afb158c90f69d80457ccd_2_690x318.jpeg, https://www.chiefdelphi.com/uploads/default/optimized/3X/3/c/3c44b6ce8825ed38337afb158c90f69d80457ccd_2_1035x477.jpeg 1.5x, https://www.chiefdelphi.com/uploads/default/optimized/3X/3/c/3c44b6ce8825ed38337afb158c90f69d80457ccd_2_1380x636.jpeg 2x\\\" data-dominant-color=\\\"917965\\\"\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"meta\\\"\\u003e\\u003csvg class=\\\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\"\\u003e\\u003cuse href=\\\"#far-image\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/use\\u003e\\u003c/svg\\u003e\\u003cspan class=\\\"filename\\\"\\u003eimage\\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan class=\\\"informations\\\"\\u003e4000×1848 601 KB\\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003csvg class=\\\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\"\\u003e\\u003cuse href=\\\"#discourse-expand\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/use\\u003e\\u003c/svg\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAfter replacing the offending motor, we never had another GND/Chassis isolation fault…\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003ePrice change from ~180 → 220\\u003c/strong\\u003e: We felt very jaded when we had to pay an extra ~$50 per motor after already putting in an order for 10 Falcon 500’s back in \\u003cstrong\\u003eOctober 2022\\u003c/strong\\u003e. I understand with the supply-chain issues that it can be difficult to honor the original price, however, we had budgeted for $180 per motor. We still ended up having to purchase 6 more motors to have a full set of backups for our swerve drive, and were thankful to have those on hand for replacements…\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003ev5 vs Pro API\\u003c/strong\\u003e: The $220 pill feels especially hard to swallow when you factor in an extra $10 dollars for Phoenix Pro (or $100 for CANivore bus) for FOC and an “improved API”. Our lead technical mentor raised concern about maintaining two code-bases to CTRE in an email, and got criticized for mis-spelling a few words, and was assured Vex/CTRE had that under control. After sending a more detailed and lengthy response (with spell-check on…), there was no reply… We ran into a few teams that had Phoenix pro that were running \\u003cstrong\\u003eseveral versions behind\\u003c/strong\\u003e because newer versions of firmware introduced new issues that hadn’t been seen before… which maybe confirms our concerns. \\u003cstrong\\u003eWhy must we pay an extra $10 dollars on top of a ~$220 dollar motor to unlock all the torque performance??\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe are extremely dis-satisfied and will be running exclusively NEO/REV brushless motors until these issues are resolved. While we didn’t have a failure during a match for a Falcon 500, we still have to bring up these concerns on our part, especially considering the “cloud of internal issues” around Vex. Some may be saying we’d handicap ourselves, but we cannot support a company that doesn’t listen, so I’m hoping raising awareness will help cause change here.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRoboRIO 2.0\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eInitially, we hadn’t have any issues with the new RoboRIO 2.0 until it mattered the most here. Before Q73 (first match of Friday for us) @ Hopper division, we had to repair our intake arm and barely got the repair done until ~2-4 matches before our Q73. We went to turn on our robot… and the status LED blinked red constantly and refused to boot. That was no problem in its self — we had prepared with a spare RoboRIO 2.0 and back-up MicroSD card.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe had not populated the provided 4GB Industrial card (with image installed on it) in the RIO 2.0, and went to put that in right before taking off the RIO 2.0 … and the SD card slot slipped and slid to the left of the actual slot, essentially eating our MicroSD card and rendering the repair futile. Replacing the rio is relatively simple on our Robot, just the four screws, RSL, CAN, power, USB and Ethernet. We missed our match and our alliance lost by 23 points, which we could have contributed towards… which dampened the mood of the team since we couldn’t put a bot on the field for the first time this year during qualifications.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAfterwards, we ended up using a RIO 1.0, and never had another issue during champs @ Hopper, and noticed a few differences:\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eCode changes/deploys happen much faster (as well as initial comms connection)\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Why with an older revision would we have less issues and faster code deployments than the “improved” RIO 2.0? After talking to several CSAs and receiving assistance, we noted that teams have replaced the stock MicroSD with a higher quality card (e.g. Sandisk) and noticed less comms issues/code deployment issues (haven’t verified ourselves here … yet). Which then leads to the question… why not give teams a high-quality MicroSD card to start? I understand there may be sourcing/pricing issues with using other MicroSD cards, but would it really kill the overhead to provide a better MicroSD card?\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eConformal coating differences\\u003c/strong\\u003e: When opening up the RoboRIO 2.0 as a post-failure inspection, the CSAs (+ Team 3357 next to us, shout out to y’all, you are SUPER cool and an awesome team to talk to), noted a larger metal shaving inside preventing booting. After removing said shaving, the CSA said the RIO 2.0 booted successfully 4x times without issues. In years past, we’ve opened a RIO 1.0 and noted many more metal shaving inside of the device, but without any failures. It seems the conformal coating used on the newer devices isn’t as robust as the RIO 1.0 and less prone to shorting out internal components. We do take measures on our bot to protect potential ingress points (e.g. putting electrical tape over PWM connectors + protecting the RIO during mechanical operations), but metal shavings still found a way inside. Now, we do recognize in the future to mount the RIO 2.0 in a non-horizontal configuration (e.g. upside-down or on the side of the bot) that should prevent failures, but for other teams we feel this could create a “foot-gun situation”. We’ll be keeping a closer eye on mounting positions and even more protections around the RIO 2.0…\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eExtra memory/CPU not necessary (in our case)\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Our team noted the RIO 1.0 handled our robot code just fine without any changes to the code. We personally use C++ and have around 30-50% CPU usage, and ~30% CAN utilization (we use a CANivore too). So we’ll most likely stick to the RIO 1.0 for the foreseeable future here until necessary to upgrade (or the processor changes).\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eSo we’d like to hear what other teams have experienced failures of the RIO 2.0, we heard from CSAs that it was a “blood-bath” of RIO failures @ Champs, with 40+ they’ve personally dealt with, and probably more that went unnoticed or repaired in pits from teams without help.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003ePigeon 2.0 and CANivore\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe are overall happy with the performance and non-issues we had with these devices, our CANivore and Pigeon never experienced any hardware or electrical failures throughout all our practice and competitions.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eHowever\\u003c/strong\\u003e, there was one firmware update for the Pigeon 2.0 that caught our team off-guard … the yaw axis from Pigeon::GetRotation2D() was seemingly inverted in a recent update we applied before Champs. We now know from this experience to triple check drivability before bringing the bot to champs, but we had been testing integrating the Pathplanner library into our code-base (shout out to the developers here — the Pathplanner app is awesome and the library is easy to use). We had only been resetting the position of the bot either by driving back in a straight line or pulling the bot back into position, so we didn’t notice the error in our field-orientated drive here. We had failed to perform at all during our practice match and first two qualification matches due to the confusion of our drivers for control (we’d go in the opposite direction than expected when pressing forward) and accidentally caused our team-mate to flip over during our practice match when they were going over the charge station (truly sorry 2046).\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eSo this is a wash for us here, we should recognize to test better when applying updates, but a simple change-log window when applying a firmware update would be very helpful to teams. Then we are reminded of possible changes that could affect us and other teams here.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eFor reference, here is our Field-orientated control method for our swerve code base:\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cpre\\u003e\\u003ccode class=\\\"lang-c++\\\"\\u003e\\nvoid SwerveDrive::Drive(\\n  // Pass in speeds and rotations, get back module states\\n  units::meters_per_second_t xSpeed,\\n  units::meters_per_second_t ySpeed,\\n  units::radians_per_second_t rot,\\n  bool fieldRelative) {\\n  // Version of function that uses feedforward control\\n  UpdateEstimator();\\n  \\n  auto states = SwerveDriveParameters::kinematics.ToSwerveModuleStates(\\n    fieldRelative ? frc::ChassisSpeeds::FromFieldRelativeSpeeds(\\n                        xSpeed, ySpeed, rot, -m_pigeon.GetRotation2d())\\n                        : frc::ChassisSpeeds{xSpeed, ySpeed, rot});\\n  SwerveDriveParameters::kinematics.DesaturateWheelSpeeds(\\u0026amp;states, SwerveDriveConstants::kMaxSpeed);\\n\\n  auto [fl, fr, bl, br] = states;\\n  \\n  frc::SmartDashboard::PutNumber(\\\"FL speed\\\", (double)fl.speed);\\n  frc::SmartDashboard::PutNumber(\\\"FL angle\\\", (double)fl.angle.Degrees());\\n  frc::SmartDashboard::PutNumber(\\\"FR speed\\\", (double)fr.speed);\\n  frc::SmartDashboard::PutNumber(\\\"FR angle\\\", (double)fr.angle.Degrees());\\n  frc::SmartDashboard::PutNumber(\\\"BL speed\\\", (double)bl.speed);\\n  frc::SmartDashboard::PutNumber(\\\"BL angle\\\", (double)bl.angle.Degrees());\\n  frc::SmartDashboard::PutNumber(\\\"BR speed\\\", (double)br.speed);\\n  frc::SmartDashboard::PutNumber(\\\"BR angle\\\", (double)br.angle.Degrees());\\n\\n  frc::SmartDashboard::PutNumber(\\\"X speed\\\", (double)xSpeed);\\n  frc::SmartDashboard::PutNumber(\\\"Y speed\\\", (double)ySpeed);\\n  frc::SmartDashboard::PutNumber(\\\"Rotation\\\", (double)(SwerveDriveConstants::DEGToRAD * rot));\\n\\n  // Desired states to be logged in AdvantageScope (requires different format)\\n  double AdvantageScopeDesiredStates[] = \\n    {(double)fl.angle.Degrees(), (double)fl.speed,\\n     (double)fr.angle.Degrees(), (double)fr.speed,\\n     (double)bl.angle.Degrees(), (double)bl.speed,\\n     (double)br.angle.Degrees(), (double)br.speed};\\n\\n  frc::SmartDashboard::PutNumberArray(\\\"AdvantageScope Desired States\\\", AdvantageScopeDesiredStates);\\n  SetModuleStates(states);\\n}\\n\\u003c/code\\u003e\\u003c/pre\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eSwerve X (Tube-mount, Flipped)\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe chose the Swerve X here from WCP and after initial drive issues at CVR (due to \\u003cem\\u003eincorrect assembly\\u003c/em\\u003e) we have had \\u003cstrong\\u003e0 issues/failures\\u003c/strong\\u003e of the modules themselves. We started with a 6.55:1 Pully configuration for our competition robot, but after browning out and noticing severe shaft run-out on our Falcon 500’s after CVR, we chose to switch to a 8.10:1 Gears kit. \\u003cstrong\\u003eBest improvement to drivability to our ~124 Lbs bot here, and would use again in the future.\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eOverall, we only made two small modifications to the Swerve X modules to reduce vertical play in the gears on the top (small bearing washer under the idler plates) and improve CANCoder position relative to the magnet (small 3D printed strap over the CANCoder). The small 3D printed strap meant our status LED was always green throughout all competitions and never had them fall out of calibration afterwards.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eShout out to \\u003ca class=\\\"mention\\\" href=\\\"/u/r.c\\\"\\u003e@R.C\\u003c/a\\u003e. (Also congrats again too for winning the champs) and WCP team for putting together such a solid piece of kit, we’d recommend the modules to any team looking to get into swerve here. As with any other major drivetrain change for a team, we’d recommend building a swerve test bot as we did over the summer to iron out any possible kinks with assembly and/or test code. There are quite a few gotchas that can come up, and assembly must be done with care and QC checks at every stage.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e—\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eOverall we had a great season and experience at championships (even if we didn’t rank high or get picked @ champs), and thank everyone we met along the way. We’d like to hear about your experiences with COTS and other FRC components, since we hope our vendors can listen to our feedback. We do the same reflections and criticism of our own robot design, and hope our vendors can do the same.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e-James\\u003c/p\\u003e\",\"post_number\":1,\"post_type\":1,\"posts_count\":5,\"updated_at\":\"2023-04-23T22:07:23.616Z\",\"reply_count\":0,\"reply_to_post_number\":null,\"quote_count\":0,\"incoming_link_count\":140,\"reads\":366,\"readers_count\":365,\"score\":1043.2,\"yours\":false,\"topic_id\":435595,\"topic_slug\":\"experience-with-frc-components-and-cots\",\"display_username\":\"James Womack\",\"primary_group_name\":null,\"flair_name\":null,\"flair_url\":null,\"flair_bg_color\":null,\"flair_color\":null,\"flair_group_id\":null,\"badges_granted\":[],\"version\":1,\"can_edit\":false,\"can_delete\":false,\"can_recover\":false,\"can_see_hidden_post\":true,\"can_wiki\":false,\"link_counts\":[{\"url\":\"https://www.chiefdelphi.com/uploads/default/original/3X/3/c/3c44b6ce8825ed38337afb158c90f69d80457ccd.jpeg\",\"internal\":true,\"reflection\":false,\"clicks\":0}],\"read\":true,\"user_title\":null,\"bookmarked\":false,\"actions_summary\":[{\"id\":2,\"count\":18}],\"moderator\":false,\"admin\":false,\"staff\":false,\"user_id\":59136,\"hidden\":false,\"trust_level\":1,\"deleted_at\":null,\"user_deleted\":false,\"edit_reason\":null,\"can_view_edit_history\":true,\"wiki\":false,\"user_custom_fields\":{\"user_field_4\":\"Head Coach (3189)\"},\"post_url\":\"/t/experience-with-frc-components-and-cots/435595/1\",\"custom_user_title\":\"Head Coach (3189)\",\"reactions\":[{\"id\":\"heart\",\"type\":\"emoji\",\"count\":18},{\"id\":\"thinking\",\"type\":\"emoji\",\"count\":1}],\"current_user_reaction\":null,\"reaction_users_count\":19,\"current_user_used_main_reaction\":false,\"can_accept_answer\":false,\"can_unaccept_answer\":false,\"accepted_answer\":false,\"topic_accepted_answer\":null,\"can_vote\":false},{\"id\":3197476,\"name\":\"\",\"username\":\"Nathan2129\",\"avatar_template\":\"/user_avatar/www.chiefdelphi.com/nathan2129/{size}/187616_2.png\",\"created_at\":\"2023-04-24T16:34:26.488Z\",\"cooked\":\"\\u003cp\\u003eOur 8 v1 falcons have been running strong since 2020 but due to many issues with VEX as a company some of which you mentioned above we have tried to move away from them. we bought 4 more this year so we could have full falcon swerve (long story) but overall we like Falcons and have had little QC issues with them but I know a lot of people have and since VEX is kind of a shitty company we have tried to move away from them whenever possible.\\u003cbr\\u003e\\nWe have had little issue with the RoboRio 2. but we have had the known issue of robot code not always booting and we had to put gaff tape over the ports we were not using so that they didn’t get shorted. We also complain a lot about how slow it it but it’s better that it’s slow than for it to break super easily. my main issue with the roborio is actually the imaging tool. We have corrupted more than one RIO while using it because it seems like if you even breathe on the cable while it’s going it will fail and corrupt the RIO. Luckily NI has very good tech support and forums so we were able to fix all of them after a few very stressful few minutes of hoping our $500 RIO isn’t dead. one of our mentors said that his team drilled a hole in their Rio and NI just sent them a new one even when they said exactly what happened. Overall while the roborio does have a lot to complain about it really isn’t that bad.\\u003cbr\\u003e\\nWe have had a very good experience with Cross the Road Electronics as well. we have some Talon SRXs that have been going for a very long time and they don’t seem to die. all of our CTRE products have preformed very well if not a little finicky at times. We still use a lot of the old CTRE parts in robots because they are very robust and we have them. CTRE also have very good documentation making it very easy to use and very user friendly. we still use phoenix tuner and not pro but I’m not a programmer so I don’t know the motivation behind that besides the price. Overall the CTRE products have been very good and have lasted us for a long time.\\u003cbr\\u003e\\nWe have a storied history with NEOs and SPARK MAXs. last year we killed about 6 full size ones and two 550s all of those were due to some miss calculations on our part but we also acknowledged that if we used Falcons in their place they would have shut themselves off before they killed themselves. we also had some issues this year with the permanent magnets on the bell of the motor being poorly attached and REV customer service had been not helpful about that. The rev hardware client is also horrendously bad. half the time it won’t recognize anything and It’s just a pain in the ass to use. as for other COTS rev products we have had little complaints. we don’t use the radio power module because we like the POE injector better and we have not had pneumatics since the REV one had come out so we haven’t had a chance to use it yet. the PDH is fine both the new one and the old one have their pros and cons. I personally don’t like the breakers because you can still draw over 40 amps through them without them tripping because they are heat based but that is not a REV issue. Overall REV products are good but we don’t love them.\\u003cbr\\u003e\\nwe bought 5 mk4 swerve modules from SDS last year and they have been great the whole time. we decided to buy some l3 mk4is but they went out of stock to fast so we are waiting on that now. but overall our experience with SDS has been great. as long as you use brushless motors they work perfectly without issues. the only things we have broken is one main plate (because we fell on it like 20 times) and at an offseason even a mini cim got ripped off because someone came over our bumpers.\\u003cbr\\u003e\\nwe have little opinion of the radio. it’s a little slow and a pain in the ass to image but we don’t usually have problems with it.\\u003cbr\\u003e\\nOverall most FRC COTS parts are very good. there is often QC issues but those are hardly ever a huge deal.\\u003c/p\\u003e\",\"post_number\":2,\"post_type\":1,\"posts_count\":5,\"updated_at\":\"2023-04-24T16:34:26.488Z\",\"reply_count\":1,\"reply_to_post_number\":null,\"quote_count\":0,\"incoming_link_count\":1,\"reads\":251,\"readers_count\":250,\"score\":90.2,\"yours\":false,\"topic_id\":435595,\"topic_slug\":\"experience-with-frc-components-and-cots\",\"display_username\":\"\",\"primary_group_name\":null,\"flair_name\":null,\"flair_url\":null,\"flair_bg_color\":null,\"flair_color\":null,\"flair_group_id\":null,\"badges_granted\":[],\"version\":1,\"can_edit\":false,\"can_delete\":false,\"can_recover\":false,\"can_see_hidden_post\":true,\"can_wiki\":false,\"read\":true,\"user_title\":null,\"bookmarked\":false,\"actions_summary\":[{\"id\":2,\"count\":2}],\"moderator\":false,\"admin\":false,\"staff\":false,\"user_id\":57669,\"hidden\":false,\"trust_level\":1,\"deleted_at\":null,\"user_deleted\":false,\"edit_reason\":null,\"can_view_edit_history\":true,\"wiki\":false,\"post_url\":\"/t/experience-with-frc-components-and-cots/435595/2\",\"custom_user_title\":null,\"reactions\":[{\"id\":\"heart\",\"type\":\"emoji\",\"count\":2}],\"current_user_reaction\":null,\"reaction_users_count\":2,\"current_user_used_main_reaction\":false,\"can_accept_answer\":false,\"can_unaccept_answer\":false,\"accepted_answer\":false,\"topic_accepted_answer\":null},{\"id\":3197580,\"name\":\"James Womack\",\"username\":\"james_womack\",\"avatar_template\":\"/user_avatar/www.chiefdelphi.com/james_womack/{size}/193116_2.png\",\"created_at\":\"2023-04-24T18:12:42.913Z\",\"cooked\":\"\\u003cp\\u003eThanks for the reply here!\\u003cbr\\u003e\\nYup, we got a big stock of Talon SRXs, and only ever had two fail over the course of many seasons. We don’t use them anymore due to the “brushless revolution”, but I know they all still would work if we broke one out here. To give the Falcon 500’s credit, we haven’t had a in-match failure of the motor, just these QC/other issues we’ve experienced.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe did have one NEO 550’s smoke out on us during testing, but that was our own fault for stalling the motor during testing of our intake, and not properly gearing it down. After gearing the motor down from a 4:1 → 9:1, we didn’t have any more temperature/motor issues during match play. If we did have a thermal cut-off for the motor, this accident could have been prevented, much like your experience, so that would be a great change (if possible).\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe REV HW client hasn’t been a big issue with us, the best way we found to use it was configuration of the SparkMAX outside of the robot (or with the robot off) via USB-C. We didn’t have many issues, even if we had to restart the client a handful of times over the coarse of the season for a SparkMAX to be recognized. We made minimal usage of the client besides configuration of CAN ID, but its UI is clunky for sure … so its definitely a place of improvement. We tend to configure everything via our robot code upon initialization and haven’t had issues so far.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eYuup \\u003cimg src=\\\"https://www.chiefdelphi.com/images/emoji/google/100.png?v=12\\\" title=\\\":100:\\\" class=\\\"emoji\\\" alt=\\\":100:\\\" loading=\\\"lazy\\\" width=\\\"20\\\" height=\\\"20\\\"\\u003e to overall the whole COTS ecosystem is great. Its awesome to see so many different options from ready-made elevators/intakes to reliable swerve options.

Back in 2012 I jumped our robot over the bridge @ Sacramento, blew up our lazy susan turret, and had all of the ball bearings fall into the sidecar wiping out our whole electrical system. Big ooof.
