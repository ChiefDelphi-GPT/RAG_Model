Along with this, our Limelight position wasn’t ideal, so our driver had to position the robot to face very specifically, to avoid going to the wrong side of the reef.

I copied the initial implementation from children of the corn but built upon it heavily. My implementation allows swapping between repulsor fields on the fly and passing in custom controllers.
