We won Engineering Inspiration Award, Excellence in Engineering, and went to worlds this year with our robot Triceptasaurus and have been there eleven out of the twelve years we have been a team. Our robot for this year includes a 3 degree of freedom arm with a powered gripper, and a custom two-speed shifting swerve! This is an overview of our LabView code for Triceptasaurus, a description of our custom python based path planner, and repositories for our previous and current code.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eShifting Swerve Code\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eKinematics and Controllers\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eOur swerve drive automatically handles failures and calibrations. If an azimuth module fails, we switch the motor to coast mode, disable the drive motor for the affected module, and remove the module from the robot pose calculations. To prevent the swerve modules from opposing each other while transiting to a new azimuth heading, we slow down any module that is going against the others. To reduce system complexity, only relative azimuth encoders are used, requiring additional error checking to recover from possible motor controller or RoboRIO brownout conditions. Additionally, we assist the driver by locking the robot’s orientation at high speeds, which prevents the robot from drifting. Additionally, orientation control is automatically switched on while we are scoring, acquiring game pieces, and balancing for easier adjustments. An angle unwrapping algorithm allows the azimuth control loop to run on the motor controllers while still choosing the optimal (per-module) rotation and drive motor directions. We also can manually control whether the swerve drive is in robot-oriented or field-oriented mode. Finally, we use customizable driver profiles so each driver can have personalized settings and while we have not had much time to practice it, drivers can also change the swerve rotation center to enable complex maneuvers.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eShifting\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eEach swerve module pneumatically shifts (i.e., low gear and high gear) independently. We use two magnetic Hall effect sensors on each module to determine the real shifter state the robot is in and compare this state to our requested shifter state. Using this information, we can determine whether the robot is in high or low gear so that we can use the correct unit conversion factors, feed-forward coefficients, and control saturation scaling. We can also compare the requested and actual shifter states to know when we are transitioning between gears, stutter the ball shifter if it gets stuck while transitioning, and detect any shifter failures. The azimuth angles are latched during rapid deceleration, which can occur when down-shifting, to prevent the robot tipping at high speeds. The pose state information is also used to estimate the robot velocity during shifting when the drive motor encoders are decoupled from the drive wheel.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAutonomous Code\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eRobot Autonomy and Path Planner\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eBefore a match, our autonomous program loads a text file of commands to execute the autonomous play. We parse these user-input commands into parallel drive and subsystem instruction sequencers. These commands have multiple modes including a configurable delay that enables us to synchronize with our alliance partners. To drive complex paths, we created a custom path planner that lets the user specify multiple waypoints, translational velocities, rotational velocities, and orientations that the robot must reach. Our path planner automatically smooths sharp turns, limits the robot’s translational acceleration, and ramps the rotational velocity during these paths. Our LabVIEW path follower is a modified pure-pursuit algorithm (see more info below). It includes both a feed-forward controller that calculates our goal location along the path and a feed-back controller that compensates for the inherent errors in following the path. New this year, the path planner allows us to input calibration points based on measurements made on the competition field.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eOnce we finish writing a play or path, we can immediately test autonomous even while our robot is stationary on the cart. This autonomous test mode allows us to simulate or bypass crucial sensor readings, such as the IMU and LimeLight. Because the robot is stationary on the cart, we had difficulty visualizing its estimated position on the field. Therefore, we created a map that displays the robot pose and the path the robot has taken, either using the physical sensors during a match or simulated sensor readings in test mode. To help us easily debug any problems, we record this path, audible warnings, and the robot’s status during each match using OBS Studio. Our guiding design principle has been to allow us to develop new auto plays and paths “in the queue line” and have them complete successfully during the match without any testing on the field.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eOn the field, our robot estimates its position and orientation (pose) by constantly fusing data from multiple sensors, including the IMU, swerve drive encoders, swerve azimuth encoders, and the LimeLight vision camera. We continue to run our autonomous modes after the autonomous period of a match ends, until the driver moves the joystick. This feature allows us to leverage the crucial seconds between the end of autonomous and when our drivers can pick up their game controllers.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAutonomous Path Follower\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eEssentially, we have a feed-forward path follower with a feed-back pure pursuit controller running on top of it:\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003col\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eFirst, we generate a smooth path using a custom path planner. This computes smooth translational and rotational velocity profiles and does some basic acceleration limiting but we haven’t explored curvature related limits yet.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eBased on the robot’s pose, we identify the closest point on the path within our search window (which we prevent from ever extending backwards, effectively preventing the robot from traveling backwards along the path).\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eBased on this closest point we grab the following information:\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eDistance along the path from the start.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eDistance along the path from the end.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe feed-forward velocity magnitude.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe feed-forward velocity angle (for us this is essentially the pointing direction for our swerve modules).\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe robot orientation goal (for us this is an independent degree of freedom).\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe robot orientation feed-forward velocity magnitude.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe then identify our look-ahead point, this is where the robot should be at any given time and is used to calculate the error used by the feed-back controller. The look-ahead point is defined as either the smooth point that is the look-ahead time away from our current position, or the “chase” point, whichever is closer to us and assuming neither are behind us. The chase point is where the robot should currently be located along the path based completely on the feed-forward values generated by the path planner. This (a) compensates for us drifting off of the path due to imperfections in the feed-forward controller and (b) keeps us moving along the path when we stop to touch points like in the 2021 bounce path.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eOnce we have this look-ahead point we grab the following information:\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eDistance error from the current pose to the look-ahead point.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003ePointing angle from the current pose to the look-ahead point (for us this is essentially the pointing direction for our swerve modules).\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eNext, we have to do some conversions. The feed-forward velocity is in inches/second from the path planner and must be converted to our standardized non-dimensional drive command [0,1] based on the maximum ground velocity we can achieve. The distance error is in inches, and is “converted” into a non-dimensional drive command [0,1] by the \\u003cspan class=\\\"abbreviation\\\"\\u003ePID\\u003ctemplate class=\\\"tooltiptext\\\" data-text=\\\"Proportional Integral Derivative\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/template\\u003e\\u003c/span\\u003e controller. The independent heading error is “converted” from degrees to a non-dimensional rotation command [-1,1] by another \\u003cspan class=\\\"abbreviation\\\"\\u003ePID\\u003ctemplate class=\\\"tooltiptext\\\" data-text=\\\"Proportional Integral Derivative\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/template\\u003e\\u003c/span\\u003e controller.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe feed-forward and feed-back drive commands are broken into their vector components using the feed-forward velocity angle and the feed-back pointing angle, respectively. They are then summed and the result is field-centric X and Y drive commands.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThese drive and rotation commands get passed to all of our TeleOp swerve commands. Downstream we are running in voltage compensation mode on the Falcons during auto and applying another linearizing feed-forward controller to convert the non-dimensional motor commands [-1,1] to non-dimensional motor power commands [-1,1] which scale linearly with motor \\u003cspan class=\\\"abbreviation\\\"\\u003eRPM\\u003ctemplate class=\\\"tooltiptext\\\" data-text=\\\"Revolutions Per Minute\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/template\\u003e\\u003c/span\\u003e.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ol\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eRobot Pose\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eOur robot uses a variety of things to locate its own position on the field. First, an estimation of our pose is created based on our previous pose data (which is initially set from manual coordinates on the dashboard), how far we have measured the azimuth and drive encoders to move, and measurements from our IMU (odometry). This only provides an estimation, however, and we then fuse this odometry with data received from the LimeLight when it is available. We must use a Kalman filter in order to sync up the times that the LimeLight data and encoder data were received because there is extra delay from the LimeLight. We then do a check afterward to make sure that the robot is within field boundaries for safety purposes. This produces our final calculated pose which is displayed on the dashboard.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eSubsystems\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThis year, our robot has a 3 degree of freedom arm which is capable of all scoring positions and both acquisition stations. We have a sequencer to move to each position (scoring or otherwise) which is determined by our master controller. This movement is done first using a feed forward controller to account for gravity, then applying a custom \\u003cspan class=\\\"abbreviation\\\"\\u003ePID\\u003ctemplate class=\\\"tooltiptext\\\" data-text=\\\"Proportional Integral Derivative\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/template\\u003e\\u003c/span\\u003e to the motors to move quickly between positions. Our dashboard allows for minor adjustments in scoring positions while the robot is running by using inverse kinematics to calculate logical joint angles to reach a specified point in XZ space. For our dashboard (see below), we have a simulation that can either use real values on the motors to give a visual display of the arm position on the dashboard, or simulate those values in our Disable Test mode by switching states. Effectively, this allows us to simulate where our arm will go and know if it is going where we want it to. While we are lining up to score, we also have auto-targeting. This allows us to move left or right to line up to the node using the April Tags and limelight to know where we are. We then adjust the arm’s position so that it reaches out further toward a node if the robot is too far away.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eOn the end of the arm is a powered gripper, which uses motor encoder velocities to decide when a piece has been acquired. This is very useful due to the lack of necessity for numerous sensors and wires that would be required otherwise (which would be a hassle to route through the arm).\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eDriver Feedback and Dashboard Code\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eOur dashboard code is the primary interface with the user. To help drivers navigate the dashboard, we used three main tabs: Setup/Autonomous, TeleOp, and Tune. Information for the manipulator appears in the TeleOp tab which we access during the match The tablet provides continuous driver feedback with warning lights, voice commands, state indicators, and camera overlays and enables faster UI and robot design iterations. The TeleOp screen also includes multiple overrides including a safety override for emergencies. The Tune tab also includes crucial information including Driver Profile settings (which can be adjusted from the Tune tab), numerous calibrations, swerve module information (i.e., temperature and angle), and a custom actuator testing mode which allows each motor, piston, and compressor to be tested individually. Physical indicators such as robot LEDs and the driver’s joystick rumble provide additional feedback by showing the robot mode. Our LEDs have different modes to communicate different types of information. In the default mode, the state of the robot (autonomous, TeleOp, or disabled), master alarms, and cautions are shown. We also have debug mode with information about different modules, sensors, and the arm, locate LED mode to identify specific LEDs from the strip, choose hue to choose the best colors from the LEDS, and Party mode for fun! The joystick vibrations are used to indicate active intakes. We also use audible warnings with a voice we named “KAREN!” KAREN! alerts the drivers about specific sensor and swerve module failures, motor temperatures, electrical faults, pressure leaks, control latency, autonomous play typos, tablet failures, and calibration instructions. Finally, we have added an error map diagram overlay to display which parts of the robot have errors and a joystick command diagram overlay.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eI am happy to answer any questions you might have about information listed here.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe also are working on code for tracking game pieces along the floor. We currently have the ability to use a secondary limelight to find the game pieces on the ground and we display that information (which is adjusted to account for latency on the limelight, the position of the limelight and the pose of the robot) on our dashboard with useful cone and cube icons to know where all the pieces you have seen are. This code is not thoroughly tested; however, you can always check our GitHub links below to find the latest version of all of our code.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eRepositories\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\\"https://github.com/secret-city-wildbots/2023-Robot\\\" rel=\\\"noopener nofollow ugc\\\"\\u003eMain Robot Code branch\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003cbr\\u003e\\n\\u003ca href=\\\"https://github.com/secret-city-wildbots/2023-Dashboard\\\" rel=\\\"noopener nofollow ugc\\\"\\u003eMain Dashboard branch\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003cbr\\u003e\\n\\u003ca href=\\\"https://github.com/secret-city-wildbots/Autonomous-Path-Planner\\\" rel=\\\"noopener nofollow ugc\\\"\\u003eMain Path planner branch\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003cbr\\u003e\\n\\u003ca href=\\\"https://github.com/secret-city-wildbots/2023-Robot/tree/GamePiece-tracking\\\" rel=\\\"noopener nofollow ugc\\\"\\u003eGame Piece Tracking branch\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\",\"post_number\":1,\"post_type\":1,\"posts_count\":2,\"updated_at\":\"2024-01-06T15:30:38.706Z\",\"reply_count\":0,\"reply_to_post_number\":null,\"quote_count\":0,\"incoming_link_count\":22,\"reads\":89,\"readers_count\":88,\"score\":187.8,\"yours\":false,\"topic_id\":447682,\"topic_slug\":\"secret-city-wildbots-4265-2023-code-release\",\"display_username\":\"Silas Rowden\",\"primary_group_name\":null,\"flair_name\":null,\"flair_url\":null,\"flair_bg_color\":null,\"flair_color\":null,\"flair_group_id\":null,\"badges_granted\":[],\"version\":1,\"can_edit\":false,\"can_delete\":false,\"can_recover\":false,\"can_see_hidden_post\":true,\"can_wiki\":false,\"link_counts\":[{\"url\":\"https://github.com/secret-city-wildbots/2023-Robot\",\"internal\":false,\"reflection\":false,\"clicks\":20},{\"url\":\"https://github.com/secret-city-wildbots/2023-Robot/tree/GamePiece-tracking\",\"internal\":false,\"reflection\":false,\"clicks\":7},{\"url\":\"https://github.com/secret-city-wildbots/Autonomous-Path-Planner\",\"internal\":false,\"reflection\":false,\"clicks\":4},{\"url\":\"https://github.com/secret-city-wildbots/2023-Dashboard\",\"internal\":false,\"reflection\":false,\"title\":\"GitHub - secret-city-wildbots/2023-Dashboard: Dashboard code for the 2023 series of robots.\",\"clicks\":2},{\"url\":\"https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/mini-shifting-swerve/469420/19\",\"internal\":true,\"reflection\":true,\"title\":\"Mini Shifting Swerve\",\"clicks\":0},{\"url\":\"https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/frc-blog-systemcore-alpha-testing-first-wave/503108/72\",\"internal\":true,\"reflection\":true,\"title\":\"[FRC BLOG] SystemCore Alpha Testing - First Wave\",\"clicks\":0}],\"read\":true,\"user_title\":null,\"bookmarked\":false,\"actions_summary\":[{\"id\":2,\"count\":2}],\"moderator\":false,\"admin\":false,\"staff\":false,\"user_id\":55316,\"hidden\":false,\"trust_level\":1,\"deleted_at\":null,\"user_deleted\":false,\"edit_reason\":null,\"can_view_edit_history\":true,\"wiki\":false,\"user_custom_fields\":{\"user_field_4\":\"4265 Programming Lead\"},\"post_url\":\"/t/secret-city-wildbots-4265-2023-code-release/447682/1\",\"custom_user_title\":\"4265 Programming Lead\",\"reactions\":[{\"id\":\"heart\",\"type\":\"emoji\",\"count\":2}],\"current_user_reaction\":null,\"reaction_users_count\":2,\"current_user_used_main_reaction\":false,\"can_accept_answer\":false,\"can_unaccept_answer\":false,\"accepted_answer\":false,\"topic_accepted_answer\":null,\"can_vote\":false},{\"id\":3470840,\"name\":\"system\",\"username\":\"system\",\"avatar_template\":\"/uploads/default/original/4X/9/3/2/93234578e69f55873c63fc00fe2d0d85f23bce55.png\",\"created_at\":\"2025-01-05T15:30:31.290Z\",\"cooked\":\"\\u003cp\\u003eThis topic was automatically closed 365 days after the last reply.
